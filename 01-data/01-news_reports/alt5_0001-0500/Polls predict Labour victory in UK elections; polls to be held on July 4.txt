According to polls conducted by YouGov, Labour would win around 425 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons, a similar support to that achieved by Tony Blair in 1997. Other polls indicate the same. The one published in The Daily Telegraph predicts 516 seats for Labour and the one published by More in Common reduces the victory to 406 seats. The chamber has 650 seats and the majority is obtained with 326. Meanwhile, according to You Gov, the Conservatives would win just 108 seats and the Liberal Democrats would have 67; Savanta, 53 and 50 seats; and More in Common projects 155 seats for Sunak's and 49 for the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives had 346 seats when it called the election. They started with 365 after the 2019 election, but have lost 11 in by-elections since then. Several former Conservative MPs have moved to other parties and others have been suspended. After five Conservative prime ministers, three of them in 2022, the Brexit, covid-19, economic crisis and some scandals made the fourteen years that the Tories have been in power marked by turbulence that have disenchanted a large part of the British people in the run-up to the July 4 election. If the forecasts come true, the current Conservative Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, would leave office after less than two years in office, leaving his post to the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. British confidence in the Conservatives began to suffer since the 2010 austerity program following the 2008 financial crisis, "which permanently weakened public services," estimates Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. "Then there was Brexit and the illusion of leaving the European Union, promising to focus on the issues that really matter to people, such as the economy, health, education and security. But they utterly failed to deliver on their promises," adds Bale. The 2016 referendum on leaving Europe, in which the yes to Brexit won, with 52% in favor and 48% against, marked the end of David Cameron (2010-2016), who wanted to remain in the European Union (EU), so the defeat forced him to resign. Then took office Theresa May (2016-2019), who also resigned, being unable to get the House of Commons to vote in favor of the agreements on Brexit and the European Union. Boris Johnson (2019-2022) succeeded in making Brexit a reality in 2020, but initially underestimated the seriousness of the covid.  His lies in the pandemic crisis and a scandal of parties organized in full covid at the premier's residence led to his resignation in July 2022. Liz Truss (6 September-25 October 2022) presented an economic recovery plan shortly after her arrival that sent the markets into a panic, and was replaced by Sunak in October 2022. Keir Starmer The Labour leader proposes to reach 40,000 more hospital appointments per week in the United Kingdom, in a context of crisis in the health system. He suggests the creation of Great British Energy, a public clean energy company. Seeks the creation of a border security command to prevent gangs from crossing in small boats, as well as greater police presence. Rishi Sunak Under the current prime minister growth and productivity are stagnant, taxes at their highest level in 70 years and it has become "harder" to own housing. Only 20% of the population believe the country is heading in the right direction, with 53% thinking the Brexit had a negative impact. Controlling immigration has been a priority of her government and a cornerstone of her campaign.   With information from AFP Load-Date: July 2, 2024  End of Document
