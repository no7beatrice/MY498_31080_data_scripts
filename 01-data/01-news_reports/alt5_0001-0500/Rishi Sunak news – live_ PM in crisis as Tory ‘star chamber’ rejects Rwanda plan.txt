   Rishi Sunak news – live: PM in crisis as Tory ‘star chamber’ rejects Rwanda plan The Independent (United Kingdom) December 9, 2023 Saturday 8:07 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: UK POLITICS,UK; Version:36 Length: 14327 words Byline: Andy Gregory,Adam Forrest and Athena Stavrou Highlight: The PM is facing growing prospect of humiliating Commons defeat over flagship illegal migration policy Body   Rishi Sunak ’s premiership appears to be in the balance as the so-called “star chamber” of Tory lawyers concluded his emergency plans to rescue the ailing Rwanda  asylum scheme are “not fit for purpose”. The verdict, which will be closely watched by rebel MPs, sets the prime minister up for a potential defeat in a crucial Commons vote on Tuesday, in a struggle now reminiscent of Theresa May’s fight with a bitterly divided Conservative Party over Brexit.  The bill is a last-ditch bid to get planes in the air  after the Supreme Court ruled the government’s previous plans illegal, however right-wing Tories are now urging No 10 tooverride the European Conventions on Human Rights , after the chair of the team of lawyers signalled the bill is not “sufficiently watertight”. With the vote requiring a rebellion of only 28 Tories to fail, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is set to say the Conservatives cannot govern while they are“fighting like rats in a sack”  in a speech on Tuesday.                      Key Points                                                                Rishi Sunak facing major crisis as Tory ‘star chamber’ rejects Rwanda plan                       ‘Unite or die,’ Rishi Sunak urges Tories ahead of key Rwanda vote                       No 10 declines to say if it will compromise with rebels                       Rwanda deal costs will rise to £290m                       18 Tories have submitted no confidence letters -report                                                              ‘Bonkers’ to replace Rishi Sunak, says David Davis                    Senior Tory David Davis told The Independent that the rebels “would be bonkers to vote against it – the bill goes about as far as it can”. The former cabinet minister said he did not think 29 MPs would defy Mr Sunak when it came to the crunch of the third reading stage in January. Mr Davis said a small number of MPs were on “manoeuvres” against Mr Sunak. “It’s silly. It’s self-evident that some are using this issue [to undermine the PM]. I talk to people who have very little time for Rishi Sunak, but who still think it’d be bonkers to replace him.”                      Michael Gove defends ‘salty’ Tory meme                    Michael Gove has defended a “salty” social media post from his party that attacks Labour with an image of a BBC News presenter unwittingly giving the middle finger during a broadcast – which has been criticised by senior Tories Alicia Kearns and Tobias Ellwood. Asked on Sky News about the post, housing secretary Mr Gove said: “It’s certainly a salty intervention in public debate. “But I think the important thing to bear in mind is that our political conversation takes place in a variety of different ways, on different platforms, and it’s important both to engage people where they are but also, a very powerful point is made is that Labour have nothing to say on the question of illegal migration. “I think that anyone who has ever looked at my social media will see that I am no social media ninja. “My social media is herbivorous, to put it mildly – but on social media you have a lively debate and that is a powerful contribution to a very lively debate.”                      Labour when you ask for their plans to tackle illegal migration. pic.twitter.com/8ig9KkfFxX — Conservatives (@Conservatives) December 7, 2023                                           Right-wing Tories to meet on Monday to hear Rwanda ‘star chamber’ findings                                          14:15 , Andy Gregory Conservatives on the right of the party will meet on Monday afternoon to discuss a legal examination of Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda legislation.Mark Francois, chairman for the European Research Group, said: “The ERG will be meeting tomorrow, from noon onwards, to hear a presentation from Sir Bill Cash on the findings of his ‘star chamber’ of legal experts, following their forensic examination of the Rwanda Bill.“Under the circumstances, we are also extending an invitation to members of other backbench groups within the Conservative family, including the New Conservatives; the Common Sense Group; the Conservative Growth Group and the Northern Research Group.“We then aim to have a collective discussion about our best approach to the Second Reading of the Bill, on Tuesday.”Michelle Mone hits out at government over PPE controversy13:56 , Andy Gregory Tory peer Michelle Mone has accused the government of using her as a scapegoat for its own Covid failings, as she conceded making an “error” in publicly denying her links to the PPE Medpro firm being investigated by the National Crime Agency (NCA).Lady Mone told The Telegraph she is “ashamed of being a Conservative peer given what this government has done to us”, as the Ultimo bra tycoon launched a public defence on Sunday over the controversy surrounding “VIP lane” contracts during the pandemic.PPE Medpro was awarded government contracts worth more than £200m to supply personal protective equipment after she recommended it to ministers. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has since issued breach of contract proceedings over the 2020 deal on the supply of gowns.Lady Mone told a YouTube documentary that she and her husband Doug Barrowman would be cleared, arguing they have “done nothing wrong”, but said: “I made an error in what I said to the press. I regret not saying to the press straight away, ‘Yes, I am involved.’ And the government knew I was involved.”She claimed it is “100 per cent a lie” to suggest she was not transparent with officials, and the pair claimed a “DHSC negotiator” suggested the case could “go away” for the right sum.Labour’s Wes Streeting claims ‘wasteful’ NHS using winter crises as excuse for cash13:37 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Labour’s shadow health secretary Wes Streeting has accused the “wasteful” NHS of using repeated winter crises as “an excuse to ask for more money”.The key figure in Sir Keir Starmer’s shadow cabinet said the public needed “to hear the truth about the NHS” – promising a “tough love” approach to running the health service.Mr Streeting vowed to “shake the NHS and the public out of complacency” over Britain’s healthcare, as he pledged to bring back a family doctor system as part of Labour’s wide-ranging reforms.“I think people working in the NHS and the patients using the NHS can see examples of waste and inefficiency,” he told The Sunday Times on a visit to Singapore.And in an outspoken attack on health service bosses, Mr Streeting added: “I don’t think it’s good enough that the NHS uses every winter crisis and every challenge it faces as an excuse to ask for more money.”Labour’s Wes Streeting claims ‘wasteful’ NHS using winter crises as excuse for cash Stop ‘mad’ plotting against Sunak and back Rwanda plan, Tory rebels warned13:19 , Andy Gregory Senior Conservatives have urged their fellow Tory MPs to stop plotting against Rishi Sunak and back his Rwanda plan in next week’s crucial Commons vote.Ex-Brexit minister David Davis accused Mr Sunak’s rivals of exacerbating the crisis to boost their own leadership profiles, telling Sky News: “I’m not going to name them [the MPs]. All of my colleagues know who they are – and it will be to their long-term disadvantage.“I’ve seen this before. People who trade off their own future against the future of the party always lose.”In a similar appeal for calm, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith urged his party on GB News to “stop shouting and just literally discuss these things in a reasonable way”.And with some Tory MPs even reported to be planning an “Advent calendar of s***” for Mr Sunak and plotting the return of Boris Johnson on a “dream ticket” leadership bid with Nigel Farage, moderate Damian Green said: “Anyone who thinks that what the Conservative party or the country needs is a change of prime minister is either mad or malicious or both.”“It is a very, very small number doing that [plotting to oust Mr Sunak] – a vanishing small number,” he told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show.‘Five families’ of Tory MPs will discuss bill on Monday12:52 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Senior right-winger Sir Bill Cash will present the “star chamber” findings on the Rwanda bill to MPs in five different backbench groups at lunchtime on Monday.Brexiteer Mark Francois, the European Research Group chairman, said a presentation on the “forensic examination” of Rishi Sunak’s bill would be heard at noon.He said an invitation had been extended to MPs in the New Conservatives group run by Danny Kruger and Miriam Cates, the Common Sense Group run by Suella Braverman ally Johns Hayes, the Conservative Growth Group made up of Liz Truss allies, and the Northern Research Group of red-wall MPs.“We then aim to have a collective discussion about our best approach to the second reading of the Bill, on Tuesday,” said Mr Francois.Tories could see worst general election result in history with just 130 seats, says John Curtice12:39 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives are facing their worst ever result at the general election and could be left with just 130 seats, according to Professor Sir John Curtice.The country’s top polling guru warned of the bleak situation faced by the Tories as they head into winter with the news dominated by in-fighting over the PM’s Rwanda deportation plan.Prof Curtice said Mr Sunak’s party would be “lucky to win [many] more than 200 seats” and could see an even worse result if its dire poll ratings continued.“If these patterns were to be replicated in a general election, the outcome for the Conservatives could be bleak indeed – maybe as few as 130 seats, the worst outcome in the party’s history,” he wrote for the Sunday Telegraph.The outcome would be even worse than the 165 seats the Tories were left with in 1997, when the party, then led by John Major, was thumped by Tony Blair’s Labour – who won a landslide 179-seat majority.Tories facing general election wipeout with just 130 seats, says John Curtice Braverman suggest Sunak is lying about Rwanda’s concerns over bill11:55 , Adam Forrest Sacked home secretary Suella Braverman has piled even more pressure on Rishi Sunak – attacking his “rather strange” claim that a tougher bill would have caused the deal with Rwanda to collapse.Suggesting the PM was not telling the truth, she told the Sunday Telegraph: “I’ve been to Rwanda several times and I have spoken to the Rwandan government a lot. It never once raised any kind of concerns like this.”Ms Braverman said the bill “not fit for purpose” because of the “gaping holes” she believes it leaves open for legal challenges.Backing Robert Jenrick’s claim that the bill leaves open legal challenges by individual asylum seekers, Ms Braverman said: “There will be individual claims brought by every person who is put on the first flight to Rwanda.”She also claimed the bill it leaves the government open to injunctions by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which helped block last year’s planned Rwanda flight. “As it stands Rule 39 [injunctions] will block flights,” Ms Braverman said.Iain Duncan Smith wants ‘jungle’ of Tory infighting to stop11:41 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Sir Iain Duncan Smith has appealed to MPs to end their in-fighting over the Rwanda bill and discuss the issue “in a reasonable way”.The former Tory leader suggested that he wanted to support Rishi Sunak’s plan – but said he would wait to hear the legal verdict of the “star chamber” convened by the Tory right.He said on GB News: “The truth is, we do a lot of shouting at the moment and I wish we'd stop shouting and just literally discuss these things in a reasonable way.“I've been in the jungle now for 32 years, it’s called parliament. And frankly, that is worse than any insect bites you can possibly get.”“So there’s good stuff in [the bill] and it’s a good attempt to do this. The question is whether on the margins that brings the exact results or unexpected consequences and so I’ve held my own counsel. I want to see what the final report of these lawyers.”Asked if he thought flights to Rwanda would take off before the next general election, he said: “I think we have to. I think it is wholly feasible.”Rwanda president Kagame is ‘like Putin of Africa’, says Bill Browder11:29 , Andy Gregory The president of Rwanda “is like the Putin of Africa”, anti-corruption campaigner Bill Browder has said.The head of the Global Magnitsky Justice Campaign told the BBC: “Everyone’s ignoring the elephant in the room which is Rwanda. So, the president of Rwanda Paul Kagame is like the Putin of Africa.”Mr Browder used the example of Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager hero on whom the 2004 film Hotel Rwanda was based, who in 2021 was sentenced to 25 years in prison in Rwanda on terrorism charges. He was released after serving two years and returned to the US, where he now lives.Mr Browder added: “The idea that we’re going to be sending political refugees to a country that’s like that is just absurd. The whole thing should be torn up and thrown out.”Rwanda president Paul Kagame like ‘Putin of Africa’, Bill Browder claims Sunak’s government ‘in desperate dying days’, says Labour11:11 , Andy Gregory Shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall has been quizzed about Labour’s migration policies on the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme.Asked about the new £38,000 minimum salary threshold the government proposes for skilled workers, Ms Kendall refused to say what figure the Labour Party would set but said they had called for a raise in the previous limit of £18,600.“It really does feel like the desperate dying days of this government. Labour understands it is a serious issue dealing with this,” she said.“My concern is this endless merry-go-round of bills being put forward by the government means we’re not going to deal with an issue which is really important for the country.”Analysis | And they’re off: Kemi Badenoch takes an early lead in the Tory leadership stakes10:53 , Andy Gregory In his latest column, our chief political commentatorJohn Rentoulnotes that there was not one but two articles by Conservative leadership candidates in the newspapers on Saturday. He writes:Kemi Badenoch, the business secretary, had an article in The Sun saying Brexit was a vote of confidence in the country. And Robert Jenrick, described by the online version of The Daily Telegraph as “immigration minister”, which was his job until Wednesday, has written a longer version of his resignation letter.The collapse in Tory discipline has been so rapid that someone who is well connected to what he calls “the party in the shires” has mentioned Bob Hawke to me. This is code between us for a late change of leadership before an election, which is what the Australian Labor Party did in 1983. After the election was called, it ditched Bill Hayden, its uninspiring leader, and put Hawke in. He went on to win not just that election but three more.That late switch was made in opposition, but it can be done in government. Anthony Eden went to the country immediately on taking office in April 1955, and in that election increased the Tory majority from 17 to 60. Boris Johnson is the only other recent example, managing to convince his opponents to give him the election he wanted three months after he became leader in 2019.This time, the Conservatives changing leader yet again would look desperate and is likely only to make matters worse for the MPs who would have to make it happen. Even if, in the abstract, they thought that a fresh face might help to save a few seats, the process of making the change could only further damage the party’s reputation.You can read his analysis in full here:And they’re off: Kemi Badenoch leads in the Tory leadership stakes | John Rentoul Watch: Rishi Sunak's Rwanda bill ‘doesn’t do the job’, says Robert Jenrick10:44 , Andy GregoryLabour steps up criticism of Israel and demands travel bans for violent West Bank settlers10:35 , Andy Gregory Labour has demanded that ministers impose travel bans on Israelis responsible for settler violence in the West Bank while criticising the “intolerable” death toll in Gaza, reportsSam Blewett.Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy urged the Government to provide greater assistance to humanitarian organisations supporting Palestinians.In a hardening of Labour’s tone, he argued in an article for the Observer that “too often, Israeli authorities have turned a blind eye to settler violence”.He also criticised two hardline Israeli ministers for their “totally unacceptable” support for settlers while promoting “dangerous and extreme rhetoric about Palestinians”.Labour demands travel bans for perpetrators of settler violence in West Bank Tory MPs plotting to remove Sunak ‘mad or malicious’, says One Nation leader10:19 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Damian Green, chair of the One Nation wing of Tory moderates, had a warning some of the right-wing rebels believed to have pounced on the Rwanda issue as a way to get rid of Rishi Sunak.“Anyone who thinks that what the Conservative party or the country needs is a change of prime minister is either mad or malicious or both,” he told BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.Mr Green added: “It is a very, very small number doing that [plotting to oust Mr Sunak] – a vanishing small number.”Tory MPs planning ‘Advent of ‘s***’ for Sunak plotting Johnson-Farage ‘dream ticket’, report claims10:10 , Andy Gregory Dissatisfied Tory MPs are planning what they call “an Advent calendar of s***” for Rishi Sunak, and are still attempting to plot Boris Johnson’s return as prime minister – and are mulling a “dream ticket” leadership bid with Nigel Farage, according to the Mail on Sunday.The paper claims to have spoken to multiple Tory MPs who believe “crashing” Mr Sunak’s government and bringing back the ex-PM is their only hope of surviving electoral oblivion – and that MPs have privately urged Mr Johnson and Mr Farage to talk.One outlandish suggestion is that a former Johnson ally, such as Priti Patel, could be installed as a caretaker PM before he is parachuted back into No 10 via a safe seat, while the paper floats the idea that a deal could be struck with Mr Farage’s Reform party by handing him and its leader Richard Tice peerages and ministerial rolesOne Red Wall MP reportedly said: “I came out early to say he had to go. But I think we have to think outside the box now. Whatever you feel about him, one thing no one can question is his effectiveness as a campaigner. And we need that now, we’re staring at obliteration.”Jenrick claims on Rwanda bill ‘not correct’, says Michael Gove10:02 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Michael Gove has rejected Robert Jenrick’s claim that “everyone” crossing on a small boat will be able to make a claim even after the Rwanda bill.“That’s not correct,” the levelling up secretary said on his former colleague’s claims on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.Mr Gove said: “The number of individual cases that can cited is very small … And also it makes it clear than ministers will make a decision on whether someone can be deported.”Asked how many legal challenges will be made, Mr Gove used Rishi Sunak’s phase. “Vanishingly small,” he said. Mr Gove insisted that the bill “will deal effectively with the situation we face”.I’m not interested in Tory leadership bid, claims Robert Jenrick09:59 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent BBC host Laura Kuenssberg asked Robert Jenrick whether he wanted to be Tory leader if Rishi Sunak’s policy collapsed and he was ousted. He replied: “I’m not interested in that.”The former immigration minister added: “I’m solely interested in this policy. I want the Conservative party to win the next general election. I want it to make good on its manifesto commitments. I think there’s a way to do that.”Asked if the Tories can win the election, he said: “If we do not fix this challenge … then we will face the red-hot fury of the public.”Migrant communities leading ‘parallel lives’, claims Robert Jenrick09:56 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Robert Jenrick said “mass, uncontrolled migration” was not compatible with community cohesion across the UK.Asked on the BBC about his push to crack down on legal migration, Mr Jenrick said: “I think there are communities in our country where people are living parallel lives.”He added: “It’s an obvious observation that a million people coming into our country a year is immensely challenging to successfully integrate. I’ve seen that with the [pro-Palestine] marches through London, where I saw some people who simply did not share British values.”The former immigration minister said Brexit was the “great reform” which gave the government the “levers” to bring down net migration levels. “We must use them.”Asked when he “suddenly” become zealous about this issue, Mr Jenrick said: “Oh, I’ve always cared about this.”Sunak is ‘not going to lose’ Rwanda Commons vote, says Labour frontbencher09:43 , Andy Gregory Rishi Sunak is “not going to lose” this week’s Commons vote on his Rwanda legislation and “will get through quite comfortably”, a Labour frontbencher has claimed.“Because why would a Tory MP signal such a lack of confidence in their prime minister?” asked Liz Kendall. “They don’t want an election because they’re worried they’ll lose their seat.“He’ll get this through, comfortably.”Tories have ‘caught up’ with Labour on immigration crackdown, claims Starmer frontbencher09:39 , Andy Gregory Shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall has said she is glad the Tories have “caught up” with Labour’s immigration plans, after home secretary James Cleverly outlined plans to raise the salary threshold for skilled workers to £38,000 this week.Asked whether Labour would keep Tory plans to cut legal migration, Ms Kendall said: “I think the fundamental flaw with the government’s approach is they haven’t dealt with the key issue of skill shortages in this country.”Pressed again on the question, the frontbencher added: “We have been calling for some while for the salary threshold to be increased, and to get rid of the 20 per cent [salary] discount they have had.”Asked once again whether Labour would keep the measures, she said: “Seeing as we have been calling for the government to remove that discount and raise the salary threshold, I’m glad they have finally caught up.”Sunak made choice to produce Rwanda bill which ‘doesn’t do the job’, says Robert Jenrick09:33 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Robert Jenrick – who quit as immigration minister this week – has offered a scathing critique of the Rwanda bill, saying it “doesn’t do the job”.He told BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. “I won’t be supporting this bill … I determined that we can persuade the government and colleagues in parliament that there is a better way.”“I don’t believe this bill will work,” Mr Jenrick said. “I think a political choice was made to bring forward a bill which doesn’t do the job.”The senior Tory added: “Absolutely everyone who comes across in a small boat will put in a legal claim.”“The test for this is not, can you get one or two symbolic flights off before the next election with a handful of illegal migrants on them, it’s can you create a strong deterrent that is sustainable and stops the boats.”Labour frontbencher dodges question on whether party would ask Rwanda to return £290m09:31 , Andy Gregory Shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall has repeatedly dodged questions on whether Labour would ask Rwanda to return the £290m spent by the Tories  on its ailing asylum policy.Ms Kendall told Sky News: “We want to use the money spent on Rwanda to have a different plan that actually works. The problem is we’ve seen the government spend months and months on a plan going round and round in circles.She added: “We need to end these small boat crossings because it’s extremely bad for national security as well as the lives lost, and we want to spend that on having a new elite cross-border force to really tackle the criminal gangs that are driving this, and also to get rid of the asylum backlog, which is ending up costing £8m a day in hotel fees alone.“So we have an alternative plan for the future.”Pressed again on whether Labour would ask for the money back, Ms Kendall said: “I want to see that money spent on tackling the root causes of the problem.”Sunak will stave off Commons defeat over Rwanda bill, insists David Davis09:25 , Andy Gregory Former Brexit secretary David Davis has predicted that Rishi Sunak will manage to stave off a destabilising Commons defeat over his Rwanda legislation next week.Asked by Sky News what sort of number of MPs could rebel, he said: “Quite small, I think. You mention Braverman – people always overestimate her support. Look back at the leadership voting numbers. And my impression from talking to colleagues is the vast majority want to get on with this.“The newspapers have been saying you only need 29 to vote against – well, 29’s quite a big number actually when it comes to voting against a major piece of government legislation.“So I think it will get through next week, I think there will be some arguments about amendments, but unless the government agrees them I don’t think even the amendments will go through.”Tory grandee warns fellow MPs against using Rwanda strife for their own ends09:21 , Andy Gregory Former Brexit secretary David Davis has criticised fellow Tories “manouevering for [their] future leadership position” and warned that it will “be to their long-term disadvantage”.Insisting that the Tory grassroots are frustrated with constant sniping at Rishi Sunak, he told Sky News: “Politics is about argument, it’s about debate, it’s about dispute. But what it shouldn’t be about is manouvering for your future leadership position, or whatever it might be that’s driving some of these things. I don’t mind at all Bill Cash saying ‘I don’t think this is right for X or Y, and can we modify A and B to make it work’.“And we can have that debate, and that’s how parliament works ... but I think in grand terms the public wants us to make a decision on this and get it resolved.”Asked who is “on manouevres”, the Tory grandee said: “I’m not going to name them. All of my colleagues know who they are – and it will be to their long-term disadvantage.“I’ve seen this before. People who trade off their own future against the future of the party always lose.”David Davis calls Sunak’s bill ‘about the toughest immigration legislation I’ve ever seen'09:10 , Andy Gregory Former Brexit secretary David Davis has said he will vote for Rishi Sunak’s emergency Rwanda Bill, calling it “about the toughest immigration legislation I’ve ever seen”.He added: “I actually think the prime minister’s right that it can’t go any further”, in what could be interpreted as a riposte to Suella Braverman’s criticism of Rishi Sunak’s “rather strange claim” that Rwanda could “collapse” the deal if it does not comply with international law.Sunak ‘not contemplating’ early election if Rwanda bill fails, says Gove09:10 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Cabinet minister Michael Gove has insisted that Rishi Sunak’s government is “not contemplating” holding a general election if the Rwanda bill is voted down.Asked on Sky’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme, Mr Gove said: “No, we’re not contemplating that.”The levelling up secretary added: “Because I’m confident that when people look at the legislation and have a chance to reflect they will recognise this is a tough but also proportionate measure. And of course, we will listen to opinion within the House of Commons.”Tory right’s views will be taken ‘seriously’, says Gove09:06 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Michael Gove defended the Rwanda legislation as “tough and robust” – but claimed the government would listen to the views of Sir Bill Cash and others on the Tory right.Asked about the damning verdict of Sir Bill – leading the “star chamber” – Mr Gove said the government will “take seriously the views of colleagues” who believe it doesn’t go far enough.He also denied the Rwanda plan was pointless. Mr Gove told Sky News said: “All of the reasons that we used in the past [to block flights] are dealt with [in the bill].” He added: “It’s not the only step we’re taking – but it has a powerful deterrent effect”.David Cameron ‘spoke to star chamber chair for 45 minutes’ in bid to fend off Rwanda rebels08:56 , Andy Gregory Foreign secretary David Cameron  is helping in the battle to keep Tory MPs on side ahead of a crucial vote in parliament on Tuesday, a report suggests.Lord Cameron, and several other ministers, are said to have been helping in the No 10 push to persuade Tory rebels to back the bill. The new foreign secretary spoke to Sir Bill Cash – chair of the so-called “star chamber” of legal examination of the Bill – for 45 minutes on Friday afternoon, according to the Sunday Times.Lord Cameron also spoke to Sir Bill on immigration, although a source close to the latter suggested the main reason for their call was because the foreign secretary is due to appear before the European scrutiny committee, which Sir Bill chairs, the paper reported.Our political correspondentAdam Forresthas more details:Tory right rejects Rwanda plan and David Cameron sent to fend off rebels Gove rejects suggestion Rwanda will only take 200 asylum-seekers08:51 , Andy Gregory Pressed on why the government is spending so much energy on the Rwanda scheme when it is expected to only see around 200 asylum-seekers sent to the one facility there, Michael Gove told Sky News: “It’s not the only step we’re taking.”He added: “This scheme is uncapped – there is no upper limit on the number of people we can send to Rwanda”, to which host Trevor Phillips interjected: “Well there is. The limit is what Rwanda says they can take on is 200.”Mr Gove insisted however that Rwanda has made clear there is no cap, claiming that “there is a powerful deterrent effect” for the thousands of people risking their lives in the Channel to reach Britain.Rwanda plan is legally ‘sound’ and ‘pretty tough actually’, insists Gove08:47 , Andy Gregory Asked whether he was concerned by the so-called Tory “star chamber” verdict on Rwanda, Michael Gove cited former Supreme Court justice Lord Sumption in claiming that “this is tough legislation, probably the toughest anti-immigration legislation ever introduced”.Insisting he was not “boasting”, the Tory minister told Sky News: “We’ve already seen with a very similar arrangement we entered into with Albania that the overwhelming majority of people who came here from Albania have been returned. “It’s pretty tough actually, if you look at what we’re saying – the particular cases that the Supreme Court identified in the past as reasons not to deport people, all of them are dealt with.“So of course we’ll look at what any eminent colleague or lawyer says, but ... they’re pretty clear that this law is sound.”Gove seeks to blame Ukraine and Hong Kong for record immigration08:37 , Andy Gregory Michael Gove has been shown a montage of Conservative ministers saying for the past 13 years that their successive governments will reduce immigration.The Tory MP told Sky News that there are several exceptional factors in recent years, such as the war in Ukraine and those fleeing persecution in Hong Kong, adding that “it is only because we’re outside the European Union” that the UK can take tougher action.Host Trevor Phillips noted that the figures are still north of 500,000 even without those factors.Sunak again questions ‘rather strange claim’ Rwanda could ‘collapse’ deal07:47 , Andy Gregory Suella Braverman has sought to cast doubt on Rishi Sunak’s “rather strange claim” that if his emergency legislation had gone further the Rwandan government would have “collapsed” the deal.“I’ve been to Rwanda several times and I have spoken to the Rwandan government a lot. It never once raised any kind of concerns like this,” Ms Braverman told The Telegraph, It follows the extraordinary exchange on the Today programme earlier this week, in which Ms Braverman was repeatedly asked whether Mr Sunak was “lying” when he claimed the Rwandan government had threatened to pull out of the deal if Britain breached international treaties. “I don’t know [whether he is lying],” she eventually said, before going on to deny spreading “poison” in the same interview.The Rwandan goverment itself has said this week it could pull out of the deal if it breaks international law, and a Downing Street source said at the time: “Conservatives need to work within reality. What she wants isn’t available, the Rwandans have said no.”Echoing recently departed immigration minister Robert Jenrick, she also warned on Sunday that the government’s past experience showed that the clause in Mr Sunak’s new Bill allowing legal challenges by individual migrants will add “a minimum of six months” to the wait for deportation flights to take off.Full report: Fresh Rwanda blow for Sunak as Tory lawyers brand plans not fit for purpose07:28 , Andy Gregory Rishi Sunak has been dealt the fresh blow of a legal assessment for the Tory right concluding his Rwanda legislation is not fit for purpose, as the Prime Minister urged Labour not to oppose his plans.Sir Bill Cash, who has chaired a legal examination being waited on by many in the party, has signalled that the Bill is not “sufficiently watertight” despite Mr Sunak hoping it will revive his flagship asylum plan.Battling to keep his own Tory MPs on side, the Prime Minister urged Sir Keir Starmer to “rise above political games” and “act in the national interest” by supporting the emergency Bill.But Conservatives from both the right and the left of the party are considering whether to oppose it in a crunch vote on Tuesday, with neither camp totally satisfied by the offering.Labour will whip to vote against the Bill, meaning a rebellion by just 28 Tories could deliver a humiliating defeat for the Government.Fresh Rwanda blow for Sunak as Tory lawyers brand plans not fit for purpose Sunak urges Tories to ‘unite or die’ over Rwanda scheme07:00 , Athena Stavrou Rishi Sunak has urged mutinous Tory MPs to “unite or die” ahead of a key Commons vote on his controversial bid to save his party’s ailing plan to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda.The prime minister’s call to the 1922 Committee this week, after publishing his emergence Rwanda legislation, echoed his words in the first days of his premiership after taking over from Liz Truss, according to The Times.There are claims that nearly two-dozen MPs have submitted no confidence letters, and in an olive branch to rebels, Mr Sunak is said to be “happy to have conversations” about his Rwanda plan’s future, providing the Bill – disliked by both Tory moderates and hardliners – passes through the Commons.Sunak ‘did not think highly of Rwanda policy’ while chancellor06:00 , Athena Stavrou Rishi Sunak and his team at the Treasury did not think highly of the Rwanda policy when it initially crossed the then-chancellor’s desk in spring 2022, according to a report.Mr Sunak and his colleagues privately raised concerns with Boris Johnson’s Downing Street and Cabinet ministers about whether the Rwanda scheme would work and would provide value for money, six people involved in the discussions told the outlet.While chancellor, he is also claimed have pushed for more foreign graduates to be allowed to stay post-study, for migrant workers to be able to bring dependents, and for a lower salary threshold to enable more foreign workers, all in pursuit of economic growth, the six people reportedly said – running in stark contrast to the new policies outlined by his government this week.Braverman questions Sunak’s claim pushing bill further would have seen deal ‘collapse’05:00 , Athena Stavrou Sacked home secretary Suella Braverman has questioned Rishi Sunak’s “rather strange claim” that going further on the Rwanda bill would have caused the £290 million deal to “collapse”.She told the Sunday Telegraph: “I’ve been to Rwanda several times and I have spoken to the Rwandan government a lot. It never once raised any kind of concerns like this.”Mrs Braverman echoed Robert Jenrick, who quit as immigration minister over the legislation, by raising concerns that it leaves ignoring temporary Rule 39 injunctions from the European Court of Human Rights which blocked last year’s flight to the Government.“I know that our Attorney General has advised that to ignore a Rule 39 injunction would be a breach of international law, so therefore as it stands Rule 39s will block flights,” Mrs Braverman told the newspaper.Sunak urges Starmer to ‘rise above’ and support Rwanda bill04:00 , Athena Stavrou Rishi Sunak has urged Sir Keir Starmer to “rise above political games” and “act in the national interest” by supporting his Rwanda bill.The prime minister is currently battling to keep his own Tory MPs on side, with Conservatives from both the right and the left of the party considering opposing the bill on Tuesday.Labour will whip to vote against the Bill, meaning a rebellion by just 28 Tories could deliver a humiliating defeat for the Government.Mr Starmer has stepped up his attacks and will use a speech to accuse the Tories of being unable to govern while their warring factions are “fighting like rats in a sack”.But Mr Sunak insisted he will take a “significant step” towards his promise to the voters that he will “stop the boats”, which he said the public cares deeply about.Starmer accuses Tories of ‘fighting like rats in a sack’ as Sunak faces Rwanda rebellion03:00 , Athena Stavrou Keir Starmer will warn that Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives can no longer govern the county because warring camps are lost “fighting like rats in a sack”.The Labour leader will launch a new appeal to voters this week by promising he “won’t let the Tories take the country down with them”.Sir Keir will use a speech on Tuesday to vow that a united Labour has “fundamentally changed” and is now ready to rule Britain.You can read the report in full below:Starmer says Tories are ‘fighting like rats in sack’ as Sunak faces Rwanda rebellion Petition launched to stop Boris Johnson wearing Grimsby football hat as he’s bringing town into ‘disrepute’02:00 , Athena Stavrou An online petition has been launched to stop Boris Johnson from wearing a woolly Grimsby Town hat.The former prime minister was seen wearing the “GTFC” football hat while leaving the Covid inquiry on Thursday.Campaign organiser John Dale wrote that Mr Johnson was “using the town to add lustre and glamour” to his life since falling from power.He wrote: “Disgraced ex-prime minister Boris Johnson attended the Covid inquiry wearing a woolly hat bearing the letters GTFC. It is the hat worn by fans of the highly-respected Grimsby Town Football Club.”“Johnson has no formal connection to the club. He has never lived in Grimsby. He is using the town to add lustre and glamour to his own shattered life.As of Saturday afternoon, the petition had reached over 800 signatures.The hat is reported to be one of two given to Mr Johnson by Great Grimsby’s Tory MP, Lia Nici, an avid supporter of the former prime minister.Labour demands travel bans for perpetrators of settler violence in West Bank01:00 , Athena Stavrou Shadow foreign secretary David Lammy has demanded that ministers impose travel bans on Israelis responsible for settler violence in the West Bank .He urged the Government to provide greater assistance to humanitarian organisations supporting Palestinians while criticising the “intolerable” death toll in Gaza.In a hardening of Labour’s tone, he argued in an article for the Observer that “too often, Israeli authorities have turned a blind eye to settler violence”.He also criticised two hardline Israeli ministers for their “totally unacceptable” support for settlers while promoting “dangerous and extreme rhetoric about Palestinians”.“Britain should join with key partners like the US in pressuring Israel to act on settler violence,” he wrote.“The UK Government must impose these travel bans now, and provide greater assistance to humanitarian organisations that support Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer.“It is imperative that these forcibly displaced Palestinians be supported in returning safely and freely to their homes.”Starmer says Labour are ready to ruleSaturday 9 December 2023 23:59 , Athena Stavrou Sir Keir Starmer is set to vow his “fundamentally changed” party is ready to rule in an upcoming speech on Tuesday.The Labour leader will claim that it is Labour that “shares Britain’s values” as Rishi Sunak faces a possible rebellion from Tories on his embattled Rwanda policy to curb small boat crossings.“It is time to come together, to turn the page on this miserable chapter of decline, and walk towards a decade of national renewal,” he is set to say.“I have dragged this Labour Party back to service, and I will do the same to British politics. I won’t let the Tories drag our country down with them. We cannot and will not let them kick the hope out of our future.”The speech is being arranged to coincide with the four-year anniversary of the general election in which Boris Johnson’s Conservatives crushed Labour under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.But Sir Keir says his party is now “ready to serve” after a resurgence in which they are riding around 20 percentage points above the Tories in the pollsRwanda bill not deemed ‘sufficiently watertight’, top lawyer saysSaturday 9 December 2023 22:51 , Athena Stavrou Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy has been dealt a fresh blow after a legal assessment for the Tory right concluded his legislation is not fit for purpose.The PM has been awaiting the verdict from a so-called “star chamber” of lawyers carrying out an examination for the European Research Group of Tory MPs.While the official conclusion is expected on Monday, Sir Bill Cash, who has chaired a legal examination has signalled that the bill is not “sufficiently watertight”.The veteran Tory wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that they had been considering whether the “wording is sufficiently watertight to meet the Government’s policy objectives”.“At present it does not,” he said. “Our report, I hope, will be helpful to the Government in deciding whether the Bill in its current form is fit for purpose or will require further amendment, even by the Government itself.”Tories cannot govern while ‘fighting like rats in a sack’, says Keir StarmerSaturday 9 December 2023 22:31 , Athena Stavrou Sir Keir Starmer is set to say the Conservatives cannot govern while they are “fighting like rats in a sack” in a speech on Tuesday.Factions in the Tory party are fighting over Rishi Sunak’s deportation bill that will see asylum seekers sent to Rwanda.Conservatives on the right are awaiting the verdict of lawyers before deciding whether to oppose the Prime Minister’s emergency legislation.The faction is urging the PM to override the European Conventions on Human Rights to bring the policy to fruition. But more moderate Tories are weighing up whether they can support the Bill amid concerns about compelling courts to find Rwanda is a “safe” country to send asylum seekers.In a speech on the same day as the scheduled vote, Sir Keir is expected to say: “While they’re all swanning around self-importantly, in their factions and their ‘star chambers’, fighting like rats in a sack, there’s a country out here that isn’t being governed.”MPs who lose general elections to get taxpayer-funded help finding jobsSaturday 9 December 2023 22:00 , Athena Stavrou The MPs who are defeated at the next year’s general election will get taxpayer-funded support to find a new job.A Commons spokesperson confirmed to The Independent the programme was “due to be in place” in time for the next election.Officials are looking to pay a recruitment firm to help with CV writing and job coaching, the BBC first reported.A cross-party group recommended that MPs should get medals and more generous redundancy payments in help them after life in parliament.For MPs defeated at the 2019 election, the average loss-of-office payment was £5,250 – equivalent to just under one month of their £84,000 salary.While the idea of medals and bigger pay-outs is not thought to be on the table, a document obtained by the BBC shows the Commons authorities do want to place in place a new “budget” for career training support.The scheme could see those losing their seats given access to “on-demand” career coaches and other “networking opportunities”.Election guru warns Sunak against calling an election next yearSaturday 9 December 2023 21:00 , Athena Stavrou Mr Sunak was advised against the idea of calling a snap general election early next year if his bill gets stuck in parliament – amid warnings from election experts that it would backfire and destroy the Tories slim hopes of holding onto power.Senior Tory Robert Hayward also compared the row with Theresa May’s Brexit woes between 2016 and 2019.The election guru told The Independent: “One-issue elections don’t work. Theresa May thought she was onto a winner with that on Brexit in 2017, and the whole thing fell apart.”The top peer warned right-wing rebels against a push against Mr Sunak’s leadership: “You’d have to be pretty unaware to believe you could change the leader again and not incur the wrath of the public.”Tory ministers urge MPs not to revolt on Rwanda voteSaturday 9 December 2023 20:00 , Sam Rkaina Top Tory ministers and members have urged MPs not to revolt on the upcoming commons vote for Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda plans.Ministers have been calling round MPs in a desperate bid to get backing for the first hurdle on Tuesday. Tory deputy chairman Rachel Maclean has suggested the showdown will amount to a vote of confidence in the government.Dominic Raab, former justice secretary, said MPs “should back the bill, rather than let the best be the enemy of the good” – urging rebels to “tighten up” the legislation at the committee stage rather than vote it down on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Sir Iain Duncan Smith urged Tory MPs to pass a bill that “get those flights off to Rwanda” – stopping short of an endorsement for it in its current form. The ex-Tory leader told The Telegraph: “The reality is that we are in a more febrile state than under John Major.”Bill only has 50% chance of going through, legal assessment findsSaturday 9 December 2023 19:00 , Athena Stavrou Fresh headaches have sprung for Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda bill, as it emerged that an official legal assessment for the government gives the bill only a “50 per cent at best” chance of getting flights off the ground.Cabinet minister Victoria Prentis, the attorney general, has been told that the bill leaves a significant risk of the European Court blocking flights, The Times first reported.The official advice – giving the plan only a 50-50 chance of success from the government’s legal department was said to have been signed off by top lawyer Sir James Eadie.One source backed up the report, while another sought to argue the advice was just one of the opinions the government had sought. Not disputing the advice, a government official said: “We do not comment on or share government legal advice and it would be very wrong for anyone recently departing government to do so.”Will Rishi Sunak be convinced to leave the European Convention on Human Rights?Saturday 9 December 2023 18:05 , Athena Stavrou Rishi Sunak is facing pressure from the right-wing of the Tory party to leave the constraints of the European Convention on Human Rights.The prime minister has come under fire ahead of a key Commons vote to save his plan to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda. Robert Jenrick – who quit as immigration minister this week – raised the stakes by accusing Mr Sunak of failing to keep his word and calling for Britain to quit treaties such as the ECHR.In a stinging op-ed, Mr Jenrick argued that it was now time for the UK to “extricate” itself from “international frameworks” – and warning the Tories of the “red-hot fury” of voters.Sunak faces ‘Brexit-like’ struggle to get Rwanda bill doneSaturday 9 December 2023 17:03 , Athena Stavrou Rishi Sunak has been warned he faces an uphill struggle to get his Rwanda bill through parliament reminiscent of Theresa’s fight with a bitter-divided Conservative party over Brexit.No 10 is sticking its guns by refusing to make any major changes – but right-wing Tory MPs are urging the PM to “sit down and listen” to demands to toughen the bill or face a potential leadership challenge.Dozens of MPs on the right want Mr Sunak to go further in disapplying the ECHR, but a government source said the bill was “as tough as it can be within the limits of international law”. Gavin Barwell, Theresa May’s former chief of staff at No 10, told Times Radio that it feels “all a bit Brexit”. He added: “You’ve got these two wings of the party and it’s very difficult to see where the landing zone is.”Read the full story from Adam Forrest below:Sunak faces ‘Brexit-like’ struggle to get Rwanda bill done Sunak must be investigated for ‘hushed-up’ £100m payment to Rwanda, Lib Dems saySaturday 9 December 2023 15:22 , Athena Stavrou Rishi Sunak must be investigated over whether he breached the ministerial code by failing to declare a £100 million payment to Rwanda, the Liberal Democrats have argued.The Prime Minister’s ethics adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, was urged to look into the failure to declare the latest payment under the asylum policy for eight months.The payment – sent to Kigali in April on top of the £140 million already paid – was only revealed in a letter to MPs sent by the Home Office’s top civil servant, Sir Matthew Rycroft, on Thursday.Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine said it is “outrageous” that the public was “kept in the dark about the true costs of the Rwanda deal for eight months”.“The public deserves transparency, not hushed-up backroom dealings. We need an urgent inquiry to get to the bottom of this,” she said.Sunak ‘did not think highly of Rwanda policy’ while chancellorSaturday 9 December 2023 14:57 , Andy Gregory Rishi Sunak and his team at the Treasury did not think highly of the Rwanda policy when it initially crossed the then-chancellor’s desk in spring 2022, according to a report.Mr Sunak and his colleagues privately raised concerns with Boris Johnson’s Downing Street and Cabinet ministers about whether the Rwanda scheme would work and would provide value for money, six people involved in the discussions told the outlet.While chancellor, he is also claimed have pushed for more foreign graduates to be allowed to stay post-study, for migrant workers to be able to bring dependents, and for a lower salary threshold to enable more foreign workers, all in pursuit of economic growth, the six people reportedly said – running in stark contrast to the new policies outlined by his government this week. Ex-minister backs Jenrick’s hardline immigration articleSaturday 9 December 2023 14:43 , Andy Gregory Tory former minister Simon Clarke, who weeks ago called for Rishi Sunak to call a snap election if the Lords blocks his emergency Rwanda legislation – has thrown his backing behind Robert Jenrick’s op-ed in the Telegraph today.The Truss-era communities secretary called for “nothing less than a paradigm shift”, as he appeared to back Mr Jenrick’s calls for the UK to abandon the European Convention on Human Rights.This is an excellent article by @RobertJenrick.  He has been proven right on both legal and illegal immigration over the last year. Nothing less than a paradigm shift will change a situation that is unsustainable for so many reasons -not least that the public won’t tolerate it. https://t.co/63hlMQmjHN — Simon Clarke MP (@SimonClarkeMP) December 9, 2023 Rishi Sunak set to be grilled on lockdown doubts at Covid inquirySaturday 9 December 2023 14:04 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Rishi Sunak is set to be grilled about his controversial Eat Out to Help scheme and his doubts about lockdown curbs when he appears at the Covid inquiry on Monday.The PM – fighting to save his premiership after failing to appease Tory MPs with his Rwanda legislation – will come under pressure to explain his actions as chancellor during the pandemic.Mr Sunak is expected to be questioned about his previous claims that scientific advisers were handed too much power, and his views on the damage done by lockdowns.In an interview during the Tory leadership contest last August, the former chancellor said the “problem” had been: “If you empower all these independent people you’re screwed.”Mr Sunak also told The Spectator that he “wasn’t allowed to talk about the trade-offs” of Covid lockdowns – including its impact on the economy, schools and NHS waiting lists.Rishi Sunak set to be grilled on lockdown doubts at Covid inquiry Sunak facing ‘Brexit-style’ struggle like Theresa May, says ex-No 10 officialSaturday 9 December 2023 13:40 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Gavin Barwell, Theresa May’s former chief of staff at No 10, has said the uphill battle faced by Rishi Sunak is similar to the parliamentary Brexit wars while brought down his former boss.“It feels very late 2018, early 2019,” Lord Barwell told The Telegraph – who suggested it was difficult to see how right-wingers and moderates could be reconciled, even if the bill passes the first reading stage on Tuesday.“It’s all a bit Brexit isn’t it?” The Tory peer said on Times Radio. He added: “It feels like the party is back in that ungovernable space, that unleadable space. You’ve got these two wings of the party and it’s very difficult to see where the landing zone is.”Mr Sunak has been warned that he is facing a “Brexit-style” legislative campaign by a group of up to 30 hardliners who will keep pushing for more.“The gang of 30 are using this legislation as a Trojan horse to leave the ECHR and to pick a fight and attack Rishi,” one Tory MP told the i newspaper.“It’s all a bit Brexit isn’t it?”Rishi Sunak’s party is “increasingly impossible to lead” as the Tories remain divided over the Rwanda bill, says former Chief of Staff to Theresa May, @GavinBarwell  on #TimesRadio. @RosieWright99 pic.twitter.com/HpTyyS6oiT — Times Radio (@TimesRadio) December 9, 2023 Iain Duncan Smith urges Tory MPs to pass the bill that gets ‘flights off to Rwanda’Saturday 9 December 2023 13:18 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Sir Iain Duncan Smith has urged Tory MPs to pass a bill that “get those flights off to Rwanda” – which stops short of an endorsement for Rishi Sunak’s legislation in its current form.The former Tory leader told The Telegraph: “The reality is that we are in a more febrile state than under [Sir] John Major. John Major took us to the election.”“We’ll have had three prime ministers in this period, which is unprecedented really. That means this infighting will carry on, because it’s not settled.A hardliner on immigration, Sir Ian added: “The one way out of this, both electorally and internally, is that we decide collectively that getting those flights off to Rwanda is critical and we pass a law to achieve that.”‘Back the bill’, Dominic Raab tells Tory rebelsSaturday 9 December 2023 13:01 , Adam Forrest, Political Correspondent Dominic Raab has said Conservatives MPs “should back the [Rwanda] bill, rather than let the best be the enemy of the good”.Writing for The Telegraph, the former justice secretary urging rebels to “tighten up” the legislation at committee stage rather than vote it down on Tuesday.Raab said he accepted that the bill “leaves open the possibility that the individual circumstances of a case could render a migrant at particular risk” – but hoped the Supreme Court would need “truly exceptional circumstances to bar removal”.The former deputy PM said he was confident the legislation “prevents the UK courts from relying on interim measures from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg as grounds for blocking removal”.Nigel Farage will find it ‘very hard to resist’ political comeback, says allySaturday 9 December 2023 12:43 , Andy Gregory Nigel Farage could soon stage a return to frontline politics by playing a leading role for the Conservatives’ right-wing rivals Reform UK, the party’s leader has said.Richard Tice said the star of ITV’s I’m a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! would find it “very hard to resist” a big comeback ahead of the next year’s general election.Some senior Tories have suggested they would like to see Mr Farage join the Tories – with one MP suggesting he could be given a peerage and made home secretary. However, Mr Tice suggested Mr Farage was keen to take up a prominent role for Reform UK once again, the party he co-founded from the ashes of the Brexit Party.“He needs to make the judgment – does he want to come back full time into politics?” the Reform leader told The Telegraph.Our political correspondentAdam Forrestreports:Nigel Farage will find it ‘very hard to resist’ political comeback, says ally Braverman praises Jenrick for article warning Rwanda vote won’t workSaturday 9 December 2023 11:59 , Andy Gregory Sacked home secretary Suella Braverman has praised Robert Jenrick – who this week voluntarily followed her out of the door of the Home Office – for “putting principle before career”, as she shared his Telegraph op-ed warning that Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda legislation is doomed to fail.“He knows the detail. It is very concerning that he can’t defend the Bill,” Ms Braverman said, in a blow to Mr Sunak as he hopes to persuade MPs to back him in Tuesday’s vote.She added: “The public are relying on us to stop the boats.

That’s what Ted Heath discovered in Feb 1974,” he tweeted, referring to the former Tory leader’s decision to call an election seeking to wrest power away from unions.And as Matt Chorley of Times Radio notes, the Tories have been polling lower than Labour on immigration since last September, according to YouGov’s tracker.Given the Tories are currently behind Labour, “Don’t Know” and “None” on best party on asylum and immigration, I’m not sure how smart this idea is https://t.co/cchlPCtYpi pic.twitter.com/xySX1TCgMq — Matt Chorley (@MattChorley) December 9, 2023 Sunak’s ethics adviser urged to probe whether PM ‘broke ministerial code’ over Rwanda paymentSaturday 9 December 2023 11:10 , Andy Gregory Rishi Sunak must be investigated over whether he breached the ministerial code by failing to declare a £100m payment to Rwanda, the Liberal Democrats have urged his ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus.The payment – sent to Kigali in April on top of the £140m already paid – was only revealed eight months later in a letter to MPs sent by the Home Office’s top civil servant, Sir Matthew Rycroft, on Thursday.Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine urged Mr Magnus to investigate what appeared to be a “clear breach” of the ministerial code, calling it “outrageous” that the public was “kept in the dark about the true costs of the Rwanda deal for eight months”.“The public deserves transparency, not hushed-up backroom dealings. We need an urgent inquiry to get to the bottom of this,” she said.While Sir Laurie can privately raise matters that could have been breaches of the rules, he cannot launch an investigation without approval from the prime minister.ICYMI: Britain facing surge of salmonella cases because of Brexit, union warnsSaturday 9 December 2023 10:52 , Andy Gregory Britain is facing a surge in salmonella cases due to a lack of post-Brexit quality checks on food, a union has warned.The National Farmers Union told The Independent that the UK was seeing recurring cases of salmonella because meat, poultry and eggs have not been checked properly since leaving the EU.It comes as the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said it was investigating a recent rise in cases of salmonella food poisoning linked to poultry from Poland.“A number of the cases have involved the consumption of eggs produced in Poland and used in meals in restaurants and cafes,” said Tina Potter, head of incidents at the FSA.My colleagueAlexander Butlerhas the full report:Britain facing surge of salmonella cases because of Brexit, union warns Keir Starmer insists he’s no Thatcher ‘fan boy’ and says she did terrible thingsSaturday 9 December 2023 10:38 , Adam Forrest – political correspondent Sir Keir Starmer has attempted to calm the storm of criticism over his comments about Margaret Thatcher by telling a Scottish audience that she did “terrible things”.The Labour leader sought to draw a line under the row after he appeared to praise the former Tory prime minister and her moves to boost Britain’s “entrepreneurialism”.On a visit to Scotland on Friday, Sir Keir insisted he is no fan of Ms Thatcher and said that he “profoundly disagrees” with some of her actions.He said she did “huge damage” to communities across the UK – particularly in Scotland – only days after listing her as among former leaders who delivered “meaningful change”.Keir Starmer insists he’s no Thatcher ‘fan boy’ Kemi Badenoch pens ‘leadership campaign’ for The SunSaturday 9 December 2023 10:19 , Andy Gregory Trade secretary Kemi Badenoch has written an opinion piece claiming that Brexit has “paid dividends” and looking ahead to the next general election, in what The Independent chief political commentatorJohn Rentoul suggests amounts to the minister’s “leadership campaign in The Sun”.As The Times claims Ms Badenoch is among potential Tory leadership hopefuls “on manouevres and sounding people out” in the event that Mr Sunak’s premiership collapses, she writes: “Brexit was a vote of confidence by the British people in our country. “A conviction that we would be better off as masters of our own fate. That conviction has paid dividends and it will keep doing so because I am determined to work day in and day out to reap the benefits of Brexit.The greatest threat to Brexit Britain’s prosperity booming in the second half of the 2020s is Sir Keir Starmer.

It will only become painfully more apparent that these outdated treaties cannot be renegotiated any time soon, so they must give way.”In more inflammatory rhetoric, he concluded: “There is no better example of the failed Westminster consensus over the last 30 years than the historically unprecedented levels of immigration that have been forced on voters against their wish. “As we are seeing in election after election across Europe, immigration will be a defining issue of 21st century politics.

However, others suspect Mr Jenrick’s resignation may have more to do with Mr Sunak’s failure to promote him to Cabinet.Either way, the paper reported claims that Mr Sunak is “very, very down” and not his “usual Tiggerish self” following Mr Jenrick’s resignation – a suggestion one No 10 source rejected, however, insisting the PM remained upbeat and determined to “bash through” opposition.Sunak urges Tories to ‘unite or die’ over Rwanda schemeSaturday 9 December 2023 08:10 , Andy Gregory Rishi Sunak has urged mutinous Tory MPs to “unite or die” ahead of a key Commons vote on his controversial bid to save his party’s ailing plan to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda.The prime minister’s call to the 1922 Committee this week, after publishing his emergence Rwanda legislation, echoed his words in the first days of his premiership after taking over from Liz Truss, according to The Times.Rwanda legislation given ‘50% at best’ chance of successSaturday 9 December 2023 07:02 , Adam Withnall Rishi Sunak’s emergency Rwanda  legislation has been given only a “50 per cent at best” chance of successfully getting removal flights off next year in an official legal assessment for the government.Attorney general Victoria Prentis has been told that the legislation leaves a significant risk of the European Court of Human Rights  blocking planes to Kigali, the Times first reported.The assessment is likely to toughen the prime minister’s battle to get his divided Tory MPs  to support his new Bill that he hopes will revive the stalled £290 million policy.Read more:Sunak’s Rwanda legislation given ‘50% at best’ chance of success Taxpayers foot £300k energy bill for MPs’ second homesSaturday 9 December 2023 07:00 , Jane Dalton Reminder: MPs  have charged taxpayers almost £300,000 for energy bills  and other utilities at their second homes over the past year, a new analysis by The Independent found:Taxpayers foot £300k energy bill for MPs’ second homes Poll gives Labour huge leadSaturday 9 December 2023 06:00 , Jane Dalton Labour are up one point and the Conservatives are down three, according to the latest polling, giving Labour a 20-point lead:Westminster Voting Intention:LAB: 45% (+1)CON: 25% (-3)LDM: 11% (+2)RFM: 9% (+1)GRN: 5% (-1)SNP: 2% (-1)Via @wethinkpolling , 7-8 Dec.Changes w/ 30 Nov -1 Dec.— Election Maps UK (@ElectionMapsUK) December 8, 2023 Britain facing surge of salmonella cases because of Brexit, union warnsSaturday 9 December 2023 05:00 , Jane Dalton In case you missed it: Britain  is facing a surge in salmonella  cases due to a lack of post-Brexit quality checks  on food , a union  has warned:Britain facing surge of salmonella cases because of Brexit, union warns Cleverly begins U-turn on Brexit ban on schools ID cardsSaturday 9 December 2023 04:00 , Jane Dalton One of the flagship Brexit  policies on immigration – banning Europeans from travelling to the UK with only a national identity card  – has begun to be quietly reversed:Home Office U-turn on ID card ban for French school groups Recap: Sunak rules out quitting ECHR as Braverman attacksSaturday 9 December 2023 03:00 , Jane DaltonRishi Sunak  ruled out a radical move to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR ) – despite a rebellion by the Tory right that threatens his ‘plan B’ Rwanda  legislation:Sunak rules out quitting ECHR as Braverman attacks PM Analysis: The questions Rishi Sunak will face at the Covid inquirySaturday 9 December 2023 02:02 , Jane Dalton Rishi Sunak and the Treasury put up some resistance to lockdown measures, on economic grounds, during Covid.

For the biggest unions, the maximum award has risen from £250,000 to £1 million.Fund manager founded by Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg to close after £2bn withdrawalFriday 8 December 2023 18:50 , Jane Dalton A fund manager co-founded by Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg  is winding down after its largest client withdrew billions of pounds:Fund manager founded by Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg to close after client withdraws £2b No fines for Tory lockdown party in parliamentFriday 8 December 2023 18:27 , Jane Dalton The Metropolitan Police  have closed their investigation into a lockdown birthday party  in Parliament  by the deputy speaker and issued no fines, they say:No fines for Tory lockdown party in parliament, Met says Sunak did not mislead MPs over cost of Rwanda scheme, No 10 saysFriday 8 December 2023 18:00 , Matt Mathers Rishi Sunak did not mislead MPs  over the cost of his troubled Rwanda  asylum scheme, Downing Street said, after it emerged the UK paid Kigali an extra £100 million.The policy attracted fresh criticism when it was revealed the additional payment was made this year, while flights remained grounded amid a series of legal setbacks, on top of the £140 million previously paid out.Sophie Wingate reports: Sunak did not mislead MPs over cost of Rwanda scheme, No 10 says ICYMI: Can Rishi Sunak rescue his Rwanda plan and will Labour really help him?Friday 8 December 2023 17:00 , Matt Mathers The prime minister is determined to push on with the policy despite right-wing resistance from within his own party and a hostile opposition, saysSean O’Grady.Read Sean’s full piece here:How is Rishi Sunak trying to rescue his Rwanda plan and will Labour really help him?
