   Unionist parties are 'part of Brexit disaster' The Courier June 25, 2024 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 DC Thomson Co Ltd All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 14 Length: 208 words Body   The Tories and Labour have "turned their back on Scotland's interests" by refusing to consider rejoining the European Union, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney has insisted. The SNP leader used a campaign speech in Aberdeen to hit out at the "truly disastrous outcome" Brexit has had on Scotland. He highlighted the impact that the ending of the freedom of movement has had on businesses and the economy, with Mr Swinney saying: "You can't be a party of Brexit and a party of growth." Speaking at Robert Gordon University, Mr Swinney said: "As First Minister, I cannot sit back and accept the damage of Brexit that Labour will continue to impose. "That will hurt too many people, it will hurt public services and it will hurt businesses." Leaving the EU has cost Scotland £2.3 billion in public revenue, Mr Swinney said - arguing that a "conservative estimate" suggested there was now about £1.6bn less to spend on the NHS and other public services as a result. Mr Swinney said that "given the damage that Brexit has caused, it is absolutely astonishing that none of the Westminster parties are interested in repairing that damage" - warning Scots that backing either Labour or the Conservatives next week would be "a vote for continued Brexit damage".
