   Labour's Brexit ploy i-news June 3, 2024 First Edition  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 5 Length: 269 words Byline: Arj Singh Body   Sir Keir Starmer has proven himself as an arch pragmatist in his bid to win power for Labour. Not only has he broken pledges made when standing for the leadership, such as scrapping university tuition fees and renationalising utilities, he has ditched policies made since he took over - the £28bn green growth pledge, for example - as he seeks the centre ground. But the true Damascene conversion is undoubtedly Brexit. The Labour leader, who rose to Westminster prominence as shadow Brexit secretary, once campaigned for a second referendum to try to reverse the UK's decision to leave the EU. Now he has not only accepted the decision but tied Labour to not rejoining the EU, single market or customs union and to not accepting free movement of people - a policy he supported during the leadership campaign. This has generated minimal tension, although many party insiders expect that after an election win, pro-EU elements - keeping quiet to ensure victory - would throw off the shackles and demand a softening of Brexit. Starmer will want to keep Leave voters on side, a tension that will define attempts to balance the need, as he sees it, to ease trade with the EU to boost growth. As insiders spell out in today's i (page 10), even his limited ambition of striking a veterinary agreement with Brussels could come at a price that may prove heavy for some Leavers - following EU law and submitting to European Court of Justice oversight. Starmer, who has not ruled out doing so, may calculate that despite protestations of Conservative Brexiteers, voters will follow him in taking a more pragmatic approach to Brexit.
