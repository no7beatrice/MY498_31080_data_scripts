   Labour should not expect an easy ride from the new EU parliament telegraph.co.uk June 10, 2024 Monday 1:14 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: WORLD NEWS; Version:2 Length: 721 words Byline: By James Crisp, Europe Editor in in Brussels Highlight: Europe has swung to the Right after its latest elections, just as Britain seems poised to elect a centre-Left government Body   Labour’s plan to forge closer ties with the EU just got a little more complicated. Europe has swung to the Right  after its latest elections, just as Britain seems poised to elect a centre-Left government. Hard-Right parties triumphed in France , Italy and Austria and came second in the Netherlands and Germany. The centre-Right European People’s Party (EPP) will be the largest group in the European Parliament after its member parties won in Spain and trounced Olaf Scholz’s socialists in Germany. Labour has invested time and effort in getting Emmanuel Macron onside, while Sir Keir Starmer has a strong relationship with Mr Scholz, whom he met in Berlin last July. Now both the German chancellor and French president have seen their influence in the EU dented and are struggling to contain the political crisis triggered by the European elections. So where does this leave Sir Keir and the negotiations he hopes to hold on trade, foreign policy cooperation and migration if he wins the general election? A UK-EU migrant returns deal allowing Channel migrants to be sent back to France was always going to be an uphill struggle. If Marine Le Pen’s National Rally follows up its huge triumph with victory in the snap National Assembly elections  called by Mr Macron in the wake of his defeat, it will look insurmountable. Giorgia Meloni’s success in Italy will also make it tougher for Labour to secure a migrant returns deal. For a politician who has made a strict approach to migration a key part of her appeal, winning support for a tougher approach across Brussels, it would be a big ask to take back failed asylum seekers from Britain. The European elections caused political havoc in France and in Germany, but in Brussels there was relief that the pro-EU centre had held. The EPP will continue to operate its informal grand coalition with the centre-Left and liberal groups to pass and amend EU law. It may occasionally work with Ms Meloni’s soft Eurosceptics who want to roll back Brussels overreach, but not leave the EU. The hard Right will be shut out from influence in Brussels and Strasbourg, but are likely to drag the European centre to the Right on net zero and migration issues. Some hard-Right parties celebrated Brexit and wanted to follow the UK out of the bloc before and instead called for EU reform after the painful and lengthy Brexit negotiations.  The results now make it very likely that Ursula von der Leyen, the EPP’s frontwoman in the elections, will be appointed for a second term as European Commission president. Sir Keir will find much in common with EPP centrists and the centre-Left Socialists that Labour MEPs sat with before Brexit. However, that does not mean he should expect an easy ride from the commission, which prides itself on being a hard-nosed negotiator. The EU is open to striking a deal formalising foreign policy cooperation, which it sees in its interest because of the war in Ukraine and the need to put a united front in the face of Russian aggression. During the Brexit negotiations, the Government rejected an offer from Brussels for cooperation on foreign policy and security because it would be based on a treaty that was seen as too close to an EU-lite structure by the Tories. Since then, cooperation has been ad hoc, but has worked well.                      What happens next?                    Mrs von der Leyen’s commission has already slapped down Labour’s call for an overhaul of the Brexit trade deal; warning that Brussels was only interested in minor tweaks to the agreement. The commission will listen to Labour’s pitch for a veterinary deal which would remove border checks between the UK and EU, and between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But the elections will not mean Brussels drops its demand that the UK align to EU plant and animal health rules in return. EU red lines in negotiations for a Brexit deal for Gibraltar are also unlikely to change. The EU, which is largely happy with the status quo, will only make a deal that it sees in its interest, even if there will be some relief to see the back of the Tories after the turbulent Brexit years. Rishi Sunak had already gone a long way towards normalising UK-EU relations by agreeing the new Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, which means Sir Keir can’t rely on simply not being Boris Johnson to win concessions.
