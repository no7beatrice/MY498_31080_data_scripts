   Times letters: Taking responsibility for Brexit failures thetimes.co.uk June 18, 2024 Tuesday 11:01 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 2011 words Byline: WRITE TO , LETTERS@THETIMES.CO.UK Body   Sir, At last someone telling it like it is (“ Brexit failed, right? So why’s Nigel off the hook ”, Hugo Rifkind, Jun 18). Brexit is a continuing disaster but people are afraid to say so because it feels like a call to revisit the EU referendum, with all the agonies of that tortuous debate and the debacle of the exit negotiations. Meanwhile Nigel Farage is somehow championed as a man of truth and principle. Like most voters (if the polls are to be believed) I want a change from the Tories and I am desperately hoping for competence as well as stability. But we will also need an effective and an honourable opposition, and Farage does not offer either.                    Gerald Cook                    Nottingham Sir, Hugo Rifkind is spot on: Nigel Farage is indeed being let off the hook about Brexit. But there is winning the argument and there is changing reality. The road to the latter, should Labour attempt to walk it, promises to be both long and winding. Negotiations on any deal to improve trading terms will be tortuous, and the EU will not do us any favours. Farage is wrong. But it is not clear that there is much of substance that we can do about it.                    Professor Anand Menon                    Director, UK in a Changing Europe Sir, I was delighted to read Tom Howard’s article highlighting how the London stock market had overtaken that of Paris (“ Investors flee anxious Paris for London ”, Jun 18). This counters the general sentiment that our country has gone to the wall. We should start to accept that with Brexit, the pandemic and the energy shock the UK is performing well compared with our neighbours. It is also positive that we are likely to select a centrist government rather than lurching to the extremes.                    George Thomas                    Banbury, Oxon Sir, Simon French (“ Own goals seem to have cost the Tories, but Labour should beware ”, Jun 17) is a tad harsh when he says: “Brexit was an event and a fallout that Conservatives must own. It was on their watch, was their political project, is their damage.” Not so. David Cameron’s government strongly recommended a Remain vote but was defeated by a cross-party Brexit campaign and a very silent Labour Party leader.                    David Hoggett                    Winchester Sir, Hugo Rifkind reflects on why Nigel Farage’s patently misleading account of political affairs has not been debunked. He is correct that Brexit has been an undeniable failure but Farage postures as if it were a success, if only he could manage it. So it is with populists: simple solutions, once they are seen to fail, are the fault of others’ mismanagement. We had unfettered access to a market of half a billion people, all thrown away on the altar of a man whose view of the UK is stuck in the 1940s and who is fixated with stopping the boats — which have got worse since Brexit. As ever, populists state what people want to hear but have no realistic policy to achieve it.                    Gerard Connolly                    London SW11 Planning reform Sir, Your leading article (“ Growth Strategy ”, Jun 17) supports the mantra: we must reform the planning system. Everyone agrees. What they mean is make planning consent easier to obtain; that’s fine until we personally are affected by some proposed, ugly overdevelopment — then we rush to seek the planners’ protection. However, planners are not there any more: we have got rid of most of them. Those who remain are overworked, undervalued and underpaid. The job of the development control planner is extremely demanding, requiring detailed knowledge of planning law, local precedent, administrative and negotiating skills. And that is before they even start trying to improve the (sometimes dreadful) quality of the submitted applications. Reform planning? Yes, but it will not be as easy as everyone seems to think, and it will take longer than the next parliament to achieve.                    Frederick Stafford                    Former local government planner, London W2 Sir, Ryan Prince argues for changes to the laws concerning planning consent, even suggesting an “autopilot” system for certain types of building (“ Only joined-up thinking will solve our housing crisis ”, Jun 18). He starts his article by saying that the next government should approach the housing situation like a response to climate change. To fight climate change we must preserve our green belt, and this is also important in dealing with our growing mental health crisis. Building on brownfield sites and clearing derelict town and inner-city areas would also help to solve the housing problem. I feel that, wherever possible, the slogan should be: “Just Stop Concrete.” We owe this to our planet and to future generations.                    Gaynor Cobb                    New Romney, Kent Lib Dem prospects Sir, Edward Lucas floats the intriguing possibility of the Lib Dems doing well enough to form the official opposition to Labour (“ Lib Dems are shaping up as the real opposition ”, Jun 17). At the same time he is surely right that, in those blue wall constituencies where “round here, only we can beat the Tories”, there is a danger for them in trying to outflank Labour to the left on tax and spending. It’s a charge the Lib Dem manifesto is already vulnerable to. It may not matter this time round, such is the disaffection with the Conservatives, and Lib Dem opposition to VAT on school fees will no doubt help them win votes in some places. But, given that the Lib Dems are not going to get anywhere with electoral reform for the foreseeable future, will their “local campaigners” accept that, in national politics, the electorate they are targeting, while centrist, still leans to the right of centre? Otherwise, a respectable performance on July 4 will risk being yet another false dawn.                    Richard Kinchen                    Farnham, Surrey Strong opposition Sir, William Hague complains about the dangers of an enfeebled opposition (“ A tiny opposition is a danger to democracy ”, Jun 18), but when it has suited his party over the past 14 years it has ridden roughshod over parliamentary opposition, even unlawfully trying to prorogue parliament. This was after the Conservative Party had unlawfully sought to remove our rights as EU citizens without parliamentary approval, which thankfully the Supreme Court stopped. But once the Conservatives enjoyed a comfortable majority in 2019 they imposed a hard Brexit with very little parliamentary debate. At the same time, the Conservative Party has weakened other parts of the constitution. For instance, it has packed the House of Lords with many questionable appointments, including some objected to by the House of Lords Appointments Commission, thereby undermining its integrity. Finally, although there is some merit to Hague’s argument, it is vital to recognise the broader constitutional context that facilitates such abuse. Our electoral system leads to disproportionate results that fail to accurately represent the electorate’s views. A modest reform was proposed in 2011. Had Hague’s party not opposed the alternative vote it might not have found itself in such an invidious position.                    Richard Edwards                    Senior law lecturer, Exeter University Sir, Without actually saying so, William Hague presents a perfect argument for the introduction of proportional representation, something the Tories have always opposed. Facing electoral annihilation under the first-past-the-post system, the party may now regret its previous stance.                    John Grossman                    Northwood, Middx Going for jugular Sir, As you report (“ Go for the jugular, Sunak urged ”, Jun 17), it seems normal for politicians to “launch . . . direct personal attacks against” one’s political opponents. The normality of it is one of many ominous signs of the deteriorating state of western democracies. Take the example of my home country, the Netherlands, where Geert Wilders repeatedly called Sigrid Kaag a witch. In fact she is a politician with an international reputation for competence, courage and honesty. As a result she appeared in cartoons on a broomstick, was stalked and efforts were made to set her house in the Hague on fire. Her decision to leave politics last year was largely due to the death threats she received.                    Albert de Brauw                    Edinburgh Sir, Those who think it a good idea to make personal attacks on Sir Keir Starmer would do well to remember what Margaret Thatcher once said: “I always cheer up immensely if an attack is particularly wounding because I think, well, if they attack one personally, it means they have not a single political argument left.”                    Suzan Dale Smith                    Harrogate, N Yorks Micawber’s luck Sir, The main political parties agree with Liz Truss that the panacea for our national malaise is a combination of efficiency measures and growth. Precisely how that worthy aim is to be realised remains elusive. Tweaking the economic system according to their favoured nostrums will, apparently, release hitherto untapped wells of enterprise and the “white heat of technology”. After Keynes and Milton Friedman comes Wilkins Micawber and Micawbernomics. Let’s hope that something turns up.                    Martin Gornall                    Eynsham, Oxon Breast cancer tests Sir, I agree with Professor Michael Baum ( letter, Jun 18 ). I started reporting patients’ breast cancer as a histopathologist in 1975. It was clear then, and continues to be the case today, that some cases behave as “wild cards”; at present these cannot be predicted or identified. However, I think in the fullness of time these will not be regarded as random and in due course science will identify this cohort. Sadly it has not happened in my professional career spanning more than 45 years, but we are getting closer.                    Dr John McCarthy                    Ret’d histopathologist, Newcastle upon Tyne Opera aboard ship Sir, You report ( Jun 17 ) that a performance of                     Madama Butterfly                     on board the Italian aircraft carrier Giuseppe Garibaldi is being billed as the first opera performance aboard a naval ship. Not so. In 1962 my father, Bernard Lewis, who was producing and directing                     The Mikado                     at Khormaksar Primary School Theatre in Aden, was invited by Captain DCEF Gibson, commanding HMS Ark Royal (then in Aden waters), to perform aboard. One of the ship’s hangers was converted into a theatre and on Sunday November 11 musicians and cast were ferried across in launches to perform. I still have a copy of the programme and a review published much later in                     The Savoyard.                   Matthew Lewis                    Cotford St Luke, Somerset Out of humour Sir, My experience of watching                     Dinner for One                     countless times in Germany on New Year’s Eve differs from that of your correspondent ( letter, Jun 18 ). It was always greeted with great hilarity, the more so as the one joke was endlessly repeated. Whenever I played it in the classroom to English pupils, however, it fell flat and I never got to the end of the sketch. A crucial difference might have been that by midnight my German friends had been drinking all evening; English schoolchildren at 9am on a Monday were a rather more sober audience.                    Frank Pattison                    Horsham, W Sussex Sounds good Sir, Smells of the past are indeed worth preserving ( letters ,  June 17-18 ). So too are acoustic phenomena. I have long entertained pupils by recollecting sounds they will never or rarely hear today: the slamming of train doors at Waterloo; the clatter of the rotor flaps on the station’s departure boards; the accelerating swish of a rewinding audio cassette tape; the drop of a stylus on to a gramophone record; and the ring of a margin bell on a manual typewriter.
