   Why nobody will talk about Brexit; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR The Sunday Times (London) June 30, 2024 Sunday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 22 Length: 244 words Body   Tim Shipman is quite right about Brexit being the pachyderm in the room at this election ("When will we break the Brexit omerta?", News Review, last week). Politicians seem to fear speaking of it in the same way as actors avoid naming "the Scottish play". But part of the enormous desire to oust this government is down to an unspoken desire to overthrow Brexit. Those who voted Remain have not changed their minds, and, according to the polls, many who voted Leave have decided it was a bad decision. The majority of us want Brexit overturned, but without a repeat of the acrimony and division of the referendum. When the ardent Brexiteers loudly warn that "Starmer will take us back into the EU", millions breathe a hushed: "Oh, I do hope so!" Frank Dean, Stockport Silence speaks volumes If Brexit had turned out to be a success, politicians would be talking about it a great deal. The fact that nobody wants to do so is just another indication that it has turned out to be the diametric opposite of a success. Graham Davies Bogota, Colombia Fresh disappointment Brexiteers keep telling us to move on; to accept that Brexit is done. The problem is, it isn't. Brexit wasn't a single disabling event; it is a degenerative disease. The introduction this year of checks on fresh food products imported from the EU - after years were spent on putting the infrastructure in place, entailing yet more costs and bureaucracy - is just the latest symptom.
