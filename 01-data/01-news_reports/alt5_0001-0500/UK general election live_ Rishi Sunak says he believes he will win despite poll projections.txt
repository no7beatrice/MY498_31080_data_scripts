The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said there had been wildfires across much of the country, warning that the fire and rescue service was “fragmented, overstretched and chronically underfunded”. The union called for urgent investment to prevent a repeat of fires in the summer of 2022, when it claimed fire and rescue services were pushed to breaking point.  Matt Wrack, the FBU general secretary, said:                         An incoming Labour government will need to wake up to the harsh reality of the climate emergency.                                             We need urgent decarbonisation to avert the worst dangers of climate collapse, but we also need to adapt.                                             Firefighters are battling the effects of soaring temperatures, but a decade of brutal cuts has left the UK unprepared. The fire and rescue service is fragmented, overstretched and chronically underfunded.                                             Two years ago, UK firefighters were pushed to breaking point responding to raging wildfires without enough resources. We must not see a repeat of this chaos.                                             The number of extreme weather events will only continue to rise, placing even more pressure on our overstretched fire service. Failing to invest in the fire service means failing to protect homes and lives from climate disasters.                      block-time published-time 2.59pm BST   Nigel Farage has been speaking at a Reform UK rally in Birmingham.  The party said it had sold 4,500 tickets for today’s event and hundreds more paid on the door. Farage, the Reform party leader, reiterated his criticism of the electoral system and described postal voting as “potentially corrupt”. Addressing the crowd, he said:                        I know that under the electoral system things are tough – we’re likely to get fewer seats for the number of votes should deserve – but get seats next Thursday we will, believe it, it is going to happen. We’ll likely to see a Labour party with, you know, not a particularly high share of the vote but a massive number of seats.

He told a rally in Birmingham: “As we’re going to be the leading voice of opposition, and I say that because the Conservative Party will be in opposition but they won’t be the opposition because they disagree with each other on virtually everything - think about it, the last four years all we’ve had are internal Tory wars. “They stand for nothing.

It’s an absolute piece of madness developed in Westminster. “I actually believe it’s the greatest act of financial self-harm ever imposed on a nation by the wallies in Westminster.” block-time published-time 12.47pm BST  A frantic tactical voting effort is being waged this weekend by the Lib Dems, with party officials believing that an online targeting drive could unlock up to 25 seats in the final days of campaigning. The number of seats being targeted by Ed Davey’s party has expanded over the campaign, as a combination of the Tories losing ground to Reform UK and a stunt-filled Lib Dem campaign have opened up more constituencies. Some of the most optimistic polls even have the Lib Dems becoming the official opposition, should a Tory meltdown materialise – an issue that some senior Conservatives  complain has not been scrutinised enough. However, the Lib Dems are spending the final days of the campaign targeting about 250,000 mainly Labour-inclined voters who they believe are key in a swathe of seats across the south of England. Theresa May’s former seat of Maidenhead is among them, along with the likes of Didcot and Wantage, Mid Sussex, Eastleigh, Bicester and Woodstock, Frome and East Somerset and Torbay. Senior Lib Dem figures have been surprised by the lack of attention the Tories have paid to Davey’s party, given they believe that some polls have them winning over 50 seats on a good night. “They are fighting on three fronts – Reform UK, Labour and us,” said one party source. “They don’t have the bandwidth to do everything.” They are expecting a Tory ad spending blitz in the 48 hours before polling day.

The paper is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News UK and has endorsed the Conservative party in every election since 2005. Labour’s national campaign coordinator, Pat McFadden, has told LBC that the party wants the Sun’s endorsement next. The Sun – which famously endorsed Blair for three consecutive elections (1997, 2001 and 2005) – is still boycotted in much of Merseyside, a Labour stronghold, due to its false reporting  on the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster. McFadden told LBC’s Lewis Goodall: We always welcome endorsements, I think they matter. We have changed, broadened our appeal. You can’t win by just speaking to people who already agree with you … I would like the Sun to endorse us but it’s a decision for them. When running for party leader in 2020, Keir Starmer told an audience in Liverpool that he would boycott the Sun during the leadership contest. “This city has been wounded by the media – the Sun … I certainly won’t be giving an interview to the Sun during the course of this campaign,” he said. Once he became leader, he adopted a more welcoming stance towards the outlet. In 2021, Starmer angered many Merseyside Labour MPs  by writing an article in the newspaper. Since then he has made regular appearances in the Sun and has agreed to a live interview on its YouTube channel this month. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 12.30pm BST block-time published-time 12.14pm BST  There are more quotes from John Swinney from his interview with Sky News’ Trevor Philips earlier (see post at 11.04  for his other comments). The Scottish first minister said there was “nothing that can be done” about postal votes that have not yet arrived for voters who are now overseas. The SNP leader said he had “made it very clear about the fact some people will be disfranchised” if their postal votes cannot be filled out and returned on time. Edinburgh city council and Fife council set up emergency centres where residents who have yet to receive their ballot can have one reissued, or even cast their vote ahead of 4 July.  Related:  John Swinney voices concern over postal vote delays in Scotland The Electoral Management Board for Scotland  has already said there have been “many difficulties experienced with the delivery of postal votes” across the country. Local councils are responsible for sending postal ballot forms to voters. Completed postal votes must have reached councils by 10pm on polling day, 4 July. They can be returned by post or handed in at council offices and can also be dropped at the correct polling station on election day. Swinney said on Sunday there had been “significant reports of people who were trying to vote by post who had applied properly for a postal vote before the deadline of 19 June”. He continued: Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done. They have to be here to be able to exercise their postal vote, if it’s been delivered to the house, or if there is an alternative arrangement in place.  There are no other proxy arrangements that can be put in place, but I think it’s illustrative of the fact there was no thought given to summer school holidays. Swinney added:  I warned when the election was called that it was going to take place during the Scottish school summer holidays and many of our schools broke up for the summer last week. Those postal ballots have not arrived with people and some of them have now left the country, and they have been disfranchised because of the timing of the election, which is something I deeply regret. I warned about the decision to have the election during the school holidays and welcome the fact that a number of local authorities in Scotland have taken emergency measures to establish centres which could enable people to exercise their postal vote. block-time published-time 12.01pm BST  Here is a YouGov poll showing how Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer compare on key personal attributes, such as trustworthiness and likeability: enltrHow do Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer compare on key personal attributes?

The newspaper, owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News UK, has backed the Conservatives at every election since 2005 but said on Sunday that the country could not carry on with what it said was now an “exhausted” party. “We believe it is now the right time for Labour to be entrusted with restoring competence to government,” the editorial said.  “There comes a time when change is the only option.” The Sunday Times said the period since 2016 – the year of the Brexit referendum – had been defined by political chaos which had distracted Conservative leaders from the issues which matter most to voters – healthcare, schools and the economy. Many other Sunday newspapers have declared who they think should be in Downing Street after this week’s general election.

Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary who stood down as an MP when the election was called, had been considered for inclusion in a dissolution honours list compiled in recent weeks, according to sources familiar with the process. The list is set to be published soon after Thursday’s vote.

Writing exclusively for the Observer  with just days to go until polling day, the Labour  leader says that after 14 years of the Tories “serving themselves”, restoring the “bond of respect between people and politics” will be the precondition for a Labour government’s success. Striking a serious note and avoiding any hint of triumphalism, he writes: I am sure some people would prefer a less sober message. But the Tories have kicked the hope out of people so thoroughly, to expect a chorus of optimism would be like scattering seeds on stony ground. I believe in hope, and believe we can inspire it again. Showing that it is a privilege to serve is a precondition for it. Starmer insists that if people choose him as their prime minister, then Labour will embark on a “national mission” to create wealth in every community and repair public services “with an immediate cash injection” alongside “urgent reforms”.

The PA news agency reports: The party is running 14 candidates, standing aside in East Belfast, North Down and Strangford where Alliance is challenging unionists, as well as South Belfast where the SDLP is hoping to return to the green benches. Ms O’Neill said it had not been an easy decision to stand aside in the four constituencies but said the party wants to see a “rejection” of those who had “propped up” the last Conservative government. It comes after the DUP maintained a close relationship with the Conservatives, including taking part in a confidence and supply deal in 2017 following the return of a hung parliament. “We want this election to return the maximum number of progressive candidates,” Ms O’Neill told the PA news agency. “The maximum number of MPs that want to make politics work here at home, the maximum number of MPs that reject Tory austerity and the cuts that have decimated our public services for the past 14 years, and also to reject those people that actually propped up the Tories throughout that tenure, so that we set aside in those constituencies to actually make space for that progressive candidate to come through.” Sinn Féin won seven seats at the last general election in 2019. This year, Ms O’Neill said the party is hoping to maintain the seven and potentially build its vote. The party is targeting gains including attempting to win Foyle over SDLP leader Colum Eastwood. This general election comes after a disappointing showing for Sinn Féin in the Republic of Ireland where it was widely seen as the government in waiting, but suffered a major setback when its support in the European and local government elections dropped well below what was projected. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.24am BST block-time published-time 11.04am BST  Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, has indicated that the SNP would continue to press for a second referendum on Scottish independence even in the event of significant electoral losses at the election. He told Sky News: The issues that people are concerned about in Scotland today – the cost of living crisis, the cuts in public services and our public spending, the implications of Brexit – these are all decisions that were arrived at [in] Westminster. If Scotland was an independent country, we could take a different course.

The SNP’s long-held policy – agreed at its conference last year – is that a majority of seats would be a mandate to begin negotiations with the UK government for another independence referendum. It is possible for the SNP to be the largest party in Scotland but not have a majority of the 57 seats. After a huge swing to Labour in the past 18 months, the SNP is teetering on the brink.

Q: “There is plenty of evidence, even from your own minister in the last few days, that the economic reality of Brexit is that the UK’s standing long term is more challenging than had we stayed in the EU. And you promised control of immigration, which many voters thought would mean immigration would come down when we left the EU. And of course, until very recently, it was going up and up and up. And another promise that seems to have gone by the wayside, is the kind of bold commitment that your boss, Boris Johnson, used to make when it comes to climate change. Now, at your party’s conference this year, you shifted tack and you shifted the rhetoric, but some people believe, including the independent Climate Change Committee, it means that the UK has lost its status as a leader. Is that a mistake? A: No, and actually, you started that question with something that I fundamentally disagree with. Because of Brexit we’ve lost our standing in the world? (Laura Kuenssberg disagrees this is what she says) That is completely and utterly wrong. We’ve just had a visit from the Japanese last year, we signed the Hiroshima accords with Japan, unequivocally Japan’s stating that we are their closest ally in Europe. We’re building a new generation of nuclear submarines with Australia and America. Never happened before that we have shared technology before on that scale. We’ve negotiated the Windsor framework with the EU, restored government in Northern Ireland,joined the CPTPP trade deal and we are leading the world and leading in Nato when it comes to supporting Ukraine, investing more in defence, standing tall with our allies.

And actually, what you’re now seeing this year is our economy growing faster than every one of our major competitors. And actually we have now overtaken the Netherlands, France, Japan, to become the fourth largest export economy in the world. Thanks to the freedoms we have as a result of Brexit, we’re able to regulate and cut red tape in a way that supports growth and investment. Laura Kuenssberg highlighted comments from the Office for Budget Responsibility that trade would be much lower in the long term because of Brexit. She asks if he accepts that leaving the EU has made things more difficult for a lot of businesses. Sunak said leaving the single market and the customs union changes the nature of trading relationships, but said that many businesses are taking advantage of the new “opportunities” he claims Brexit has presented, with the UK having “the deepest” bilateral free trade agreement with the EU. He said the UK can sign trade deals with faster growing parts of the economies around the world, like in Asia.

The deputy prime minister told Sky News: There is a threat in all elections, and indeed we see it in this election from hostile state actors seeking to influence the outcome of the election campaign. Russia is a prime example of this, and this is a classic example from the Russian playbook. What I would say is this is relatively typical, low-level stuff, but we stood up the election cell in the Cabinet Office, we did that at the very beginning of the campaign, and it was designed to look into exactly this sort of thing and I think that … It should just be a salutary reminder for all of us, when you engage on social media, are these people that you think are posting stuff, are they real or are they bots generated by hostile state actors? It’s something we all need to be aware of. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.09am BST block-time published-time 9.05am BST   Oliver Dowden: Claims of Russian interference in the UK general election 'gravely concerning'   The UK’s deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, has warned that alleged Russian interference in the UK general election campaign is “gravely concerning”. He responded to Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s (ABC) claims  that it had been monitoring five coordinated Facebook pages promoting Kremlin talking points, with some expressing support for the Reform UK party. In a statement carried by the Sunday Times , Dowden said: These revelations reveal the real risk our democracy faces in this uncertain world. Malign foreign actors, promoting British political parties, policies and views that fit their agenda is just another example of the challenges in the increasingly volatile cyberspace of the 21st century and is gravely concerning to see during an election campaign. According to ABC, the pages appeared to have little in common but were linked through an examination of the location data attached to the pages’ administrators, the tracking of paid ads, and an analysis of the pages’ similar or shared content. The network of pages has a combined 190,000 followers, each featuring criticism of several UK political parties, including the Conservatives and Labour, according to the ABC. Conservative party chairman Richard Holden has written to Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, and Sir Tim Barrow, the national security adviser, asking for the claims to be investigated. block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.15am BST block-time published-time 8.55am BST   Buyer's remorse will set in if public votes in Labour government, deputy prime minister says   The UK’s deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, has been asked by Trevor Phillips on Sky News if it is too late to unite the “Conservative family”. He admits that he has spoken to many voters who are undecided about what party they are going to vote for on 4 July, adding that he understands people’s concerns about the Tories, who have been in power for the last 14 years. Dowden said: The only way, if you share out conservative values, of cutting taxes, of controlling migration, it’s only by voting Conservative that you can stop Labour getting in. And what I would say is just think, think in six months’ times how you’re going to feel. I have a strong feeling the shine is going to come off Labour pretty quickly, buyer’s remorse will set in. And the bigger the Labour majority, the bigger the buyer’s remorse. Everyone still has it in their hands to stop that by making sure they vote Conservative. Dowden says his aim is still for the Conservatives to win an “overall majority”, something that is extremely unlikely. He said the public should not focus on their anger “just now” and instead think of what the country would be like in six months to a year’s time if led by Keir Starmer, the Labour party leader. enltr"My aim is to make sure we win an overall majority." @TrevorPTweets  asks the Deputy Prime Minister @OliverDowden  what the realistic hopes for the Tories are at the election. https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3 ??

The final Sunday of the campaign will see Rishi Sunak face the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg for what could be the last time as prime minister, if the polls are to be proved correct. The prime minister, who is himself in danger of losing his seat of Richmond and Northallerton , is today warning that Labour would cause “irreversible damage within just 100 days of coming to power”. Sunak said: It’s clear that Labour would do irreversible damage within just 100 days of coming to power. Whether it’s announcing a suite of tax rises or throwing thousands of families’ plans for the autumn term into chaos, with children wondering if they will have a desk at school to go back to. Labour would throw open our borders with their illegal migrant amnesty and free movement for under-30s in their deal with the EU, making us the soft touch migrant capital of the world. They cannot be trusted. We must not surrender our taxes, our borders and our security to them. Only the Conservatives will deliver tax cuts, a growing economy and a brighter, more secure future for everyone. The prime minister will follow up his appearance on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg by campaigning in London. We can expect the last few days of the campaign will see Conservatives repeating the idea of an unchecked Labour administration in power. On Saturday, the final Opinium poll for the Observer showed Labour had retained a 20-point lead over the Conservatives – the same as a week ago and enough to deliver a large House of Commons majority if replicated on Thursday. Labour is on 40% (unchanged compared with a week ago), while the Conservatives are on 20% (also unchanged). Reform UK is up 1 point on 17%, the Liberal Democrats up 1 point on 13% and the Greens down 3 points on 6% (you can read more in this story here  ). Here is some of what to expect on the campaign trail today: The UK’s deputy prime minister, Oliver Dowden, will be on Sky News, where he is likely to face questions about reports he could be put in place as a caretaker Tory leader if Sunak quits after a defeat in Thursday’s general election.The Reform party leader, Nigel Farage, will be on Sky’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips. He will later address a gathering of 5,000 Reform UK supporters at Birmingham’s NEC, which he said would be “our biggest rally ever”.Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, and Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper will also be on the airwaves.Swinney, the SNP leader, is expected to follow up his morning TV appearance with a campaign event, while Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and Lib Dem leader Ed Davey will also be campaigning.Labour’s national campaign coordinator, Pat McFadden, will be setting out his party’s message that it can “stop the chaos” – but only if people turn out to vote. It is Yohannes Lowe here for the next couple of hours.
