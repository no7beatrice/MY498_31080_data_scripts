   Labour must be firm and reverse the terrible mistake that is Brexit Metro (UK) May 2, 2024 Thursday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: FEATURES; Pg. 11 Length: 224 words Body   n Julian (MetroTalk, Tue) rightly points to the 'Cameron-Osborne austerity programme' and 'the disaster that Brexit has become' as two ways in which the Conservatives have undermined the economy in the past 14 years. A Labour government would no doubt love to reverse austerity. The odd thing is how the party leadership remains so reticent to talk about Brexit; odder still when you consider 85 per cent of 2019 Labour voters say Brexit was a mistake (YouGov, Apr 10-11). A mistake that's behind an estimated four per cent hit to UK GDP, according to the Office For Budget Responsibility. Given the state of public finances that Labour will probably inherit after the election, it'll struggle to undo austerity in the foreseeable future. Reversing Brexit and recovering at least some of the growth it's robbed us of looks - relatively speaking - more achievable. We're long past the time when the main opposition party should have been talking more openly about all the harm our departure from the EU is causing and what it will do to repair the damage. Only Rishi Sunak's dilly-dallying about the election date has afforded Labour a bit of extra time in which to get its act together and drop the wishy-washy Brexit approach - and join most of its supporters in concluding what a terrible Tory mistake Brexit has proven to be.
