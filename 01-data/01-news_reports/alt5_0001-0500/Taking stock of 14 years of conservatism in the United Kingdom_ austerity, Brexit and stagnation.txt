   Taking stock of 14 years of conservatism in the United Kingdom: austerity, Brexit and stagnation. CE Noticias Financieras English June 23, 2024 Sunday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC.

There are still five hours to go before the grocery store opens its doors, but they will wait all that time to take home a bag of a basic variety of foodstuffs. By then there will be many more queuing up. They look askance at the reporter, preferring to avoid questions. In the sixth richest nation on the planet there are currently about 3,000 food banks, which provide necessary sustenance to millions of users. Specifically, the Trusell Trust, the largest philanthropic relief network in the UK, distributed three million food rations in the 2022-2023 fiscal year. That's 37% more than the previous year, 1.14 million of those servings, for minors. "It is not fair that our social safety net cannot protect citizens against having to skip meals, having to keep basic appliances turned off, or having their homes remain dark or cold," denounces Beatrice Orchard, the NGO's Director of Policy and Public Affairs. Fourteen years of Conservative governments in the United Kingdom have left a country with greater inequalities, licking the wounds of Brexit, which are added to those caused by the pandemic or the war in Ukraine. David Cameron's government embarked on an era of austerity to overcome the financial crisis of 2007, which put the brakes on public and private investment. The country now suffers from a double challenge: stagnation and lack of productivity. If the Labor Party, as all the polls predict, wins the elections on July 4, its candidate, Keir Starmer, will have a difficult task ahead of him. There are still many British strengths, such as a clear leadership in the export of services, a highly qualified population, universities with immense prestige and a flexible and agile labor market, but it is a country that drags structural deficiencies and a deterioration of public services that the Tories were unable to correct in a decade and a half. This is a review of the state of the UK ahead of a crucial election in its recent history. Cost of living Boris Johnson's government gambled its luck that the pandemic, a devastating tsunami that affected half the world, would help to camouflage much of the negative consequences that Brexit, as anticipated by all the experts, was going to bring with it. But that decision made things even worse, because Downing Street had already pushed through, when the health crisis was raging, a deeply restrictive Immigration Act, under cover of its divorce from the EU. At the end of 2021, the UK was faced with a severe shortage problem. Some outlets of the fast food chain McDonald's were forced to close for lack of raw materials, and the shelves of large supermarkets such as Sainsbury's appeared desolately empty. The main employers' organization, the CBI, estimated at the time that the UK would need at least 100,000 more lorry drivers to alleviate the growing shortages. And that was not just one of the major holes. There was a shortage of workers capable of handling heavy machinery, as well as short-haul haul truckers. And personnel for food processing plants, for tending livestock or harvesting fruits, vegetables and flowers. There were not enough clerks for the stores, workers for the warehouses, cleaning staff for hotels and offices. There were no carpenters, electricians, mechanical engineers or assembly plant workers. And when the pandemic disappeared, inflation arrived. Eleven percent. Electricity or gas prices skyrocketed. In April 2023, the annual energy expenditure of the average British household rose by more than 1,600 euros (almost 1,800 dollars); the shopping basket by almost 1,200 euros (1,270 dollars). In October of that year, the average weekly wage in the UK was about (EURO)730 ($790). Slightly below what it was in 2008, excluding inflation. "The combination of low growth and high inequality has proved toxic for Britons in the middle and lower classes. Both segments are now poorer than their equivalents in countries we tend to compare ourselves with, such as France, the Netherlands, Canada, Germany or Australia. That's why we find it so hard to cope, for example, with a rise in electricity bills," explains Torsten Bell, the economist who in recent years headed the prestigious progressive economic think tank Resolution Foundation and is now a Labour Party candidate, in his book Great Britain? How We Get Our Future Back. "We are a stagnant nation," he argues. The healthcare crisis At the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012, one of the central numbers was a choreography of nurses, doctors, patients and hospital beds dancing around the giant letters NHS (National Health Service). The jewel in the crown. British public healthcare, created in 1948 and imitated all over the world. The waiting list for treatment prescribed by the family doctor or specialist reached a record 7.8 million patients in England (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with health autonomy, suffer similar problems) in 2023. In 2020, the number was 4.6 million. In early 2010, it was 2.3 million. Nearly 400,000 people have had to wait more than a year to be treated. The United Kingdom suffered in 2023 the winter of discontent in public healthcare. Nurses, emergency staff, ambulance drivers, resident doctors... one group after another staged consecutive weeks of strike action to demand a pay rise. Double-digit inflation and 14 years of wage freezes had put a large part of the healthcare workforce up against the wall. More than a million scheduled appointments and operations had to be cancelled or rescheduled. And yet, as this correspondent saw, there were many drivers on cold February mornings honking their horns in support of the nurses gathered at the gates of St. Thomas's Hospital on the banks of the Thames. The Brexit caused many EU healthcare staff - the well-known Spanish nurses, for example - to leave the country. The NHS, and above all the Social Care services (residential homes and care for dependents), urgently need to increase their workforce; now, a large part of the new recruits come from Africa and Asia. The Johnson and Sunak governments have invested considerable sums in public healthcare over the past five years, and increased the number of doctors and nurses. But the lack of investment that began during the austerity era, and an increasingly aging population, has meant that the quality of healthcare remains very poor. Need for investment in education In September last year, just as the school year was about to begin, the Conservative government announced a surprise temporary closure of more than 150 schools across the country due to the risk of collapse. A building material used extensively in the 1950s had reached its expiration date, in roofs and walls. It had been known for some time, but nothing was done. Since 2021, the British Ministry of Education was handling a report that at least 700,000 pupils were attending facilities in urgent need of repair. "The delayed impact of all the previous cuts, especially the reduction of investment in the repair and maintenance of schools, hospitals or courts, has meant that public services remain at a very poor standard," says Stephen Hunsaker, economic researcher at the organization UK in a Changing Europe. In the case of education, too, the main problem is the lack of teachers. At the end of the pandemic, the number of applicants for teaching posts at both primary and secondary level fell by 20%. The inequality between students from advantaged and disadvantaged classes, aggravated during the confinement, was expressed in all its rawness when normality returned. The level of "persistent absence", which is reached by missing more than 10% of the school year, was as high as 25% in secondary school. In the case of students from poor backgrounds, the figure is as high as 46%. The housing crisis The United Kingdom shares with other European countries a housing crisis that forces young people to prolong their stay in their parents' home or to resign themselves to a long shared tenancy. Traditionally, an affordable house was worth three years' worth of an average annual salary. Today, in England and Wales that is about 40,000 euros. In other words, a first property should cost in the region of (EURO)120,000. The average price of a home today is (EURO)320,000. The decline in the number of young homeowners in the UK is much sharper, almost double, than in other European countries such as France or Germany. The supply of social housing, in a country where urban planning is complex and costly, has fallen sharply. If in 1980, 25% of adults aged 25-34 paid social rents, by 2019 the figure had fallen to 10%. The Housing Act passed by Margaret Thatcher's government, which allowed tenants to take over at a price that was sometimes half the market rate, created a nation of landlords and mortgaged the future prospects of young people. Fourteen years of Conservative governments have done nothing but protect the property wealth of the elderly at the expense of the next generation. The challenge of immigration Brexit, the Eurosceptics promised, would mean taking back control of the borders. Take Back Control, said the slogan of the supporters of leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum. The new immigration laws passed just after that divorce were going to reduce some numbers that David Cameron's Conservative government promised to lower, without success. Quite the opposite. It is true that the arrival of EU citizens to the UK was stopped in its tracks. The almost five million who were already living in the UK before, and achieved their settled status or indefinite residence permit, remained inside. For the rest, the doors were closed, especially those of the British labor market. But the country began to register record numbers of immigrants from countries outside the EU. In 2023, the net balance (arrivals minus departures) reached 685,000 new arrivals, compared with average increases of between 200,000 and 300,000 in the years before the pandemic. Indians (21%), Nigerians (12%) and Chinese (7%) are now the predominant flows, along with the temporary arrival of almost 175,000 Ukrainians. The new immigrants are taking up vacancies in the health care system or in the care allowances previously occupied by European citizens. Or they contribute to the financial support of universities with annual tuition fees of around 30,000 euros. Sunak's Conservative Party has engaged in an upward auction with the populist Nigel Farage and his party, Reform UK, which threatens to wrest the right-wing space from the Tories, to see who is tougher in his anti-immigration rhetoric. Sunak has promised ever-shrinking annual visa limits and a tough hand on irregular immigration, with his plan for deportations to Rwanda. Labor has pledged to reverse that plan, but also promises strict limits on the increase in new residents. Trade damaged It was former Prime Minister Theresa May who heralded the new era of a global UK - Global Britain - which, now freed from the shackles of the EU, would strike trade deals with the entire planet. Boris Johnson inherited and amplified the slogan. The results of both, as well as Sunak's, reached a mediocre level. The country has not become a global trading power. Quite the opposite. The sought-after free trade agreement with the USA has never materialized. Nor has the intended agreement with India been concluded. And those reached with Australia and New Zealand are small in size and with distant countries. They are not enough to compensate for the enormous loss of having left the European single market, which accounted for 60% of the UK's trade. "The UK's economic performance since the end of the financial crisis has been rather lackluster. Partly as a result of policies such as austerity or also Brexit, which have reduced growth. But also as a consequence of long-standing structural weaknesses," wrote Professors Jonathan Portes and Sara Hall in their report for UK in a Changing Europe. The Brexit mirage, which took up almost half of the 14 years of Tory governments, exhausted the country politically and ended up making it poorer. But the British, according to the polls, are going to punish the Conservatives above all for leaving a worse United Kingdom than the one that was handed over to them.
