   Irony is Labour may now reap the benefits of Brexit; Letters Financial Times (London, England) June 14, 2024 Friday Edition 1, USA Edition  Copyright 2024 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 14 Length: 239 words Body   Robert Shrimsley (Opinion, June 6) cleverly uses the usual Remainer tropes around Brexit to make bold assertions that the decision to leave the EU has been a failure. His subtext or "real narrative" that Brexit has also broken the Conservative party is a fallacy. In reality, it was only Theresa May who, by dint of ignorance and lack of strategy, became a genuine casualty of Brexit. Given that Brexit is an ongoing process, it is relatively easy to argue, as the late Chinese premier Zhou Enlai did when asked if the French Revolution had been a success, that "it's too early to say". For many leavers Brexit merely corrected a historic anomaly. Our export of goods to the EU is lower since the referendum. Our services exports have in fact increased since 2016 given we are predominantly a services-based economy. The sky didn't and still hasn't fallen in. More accurately, the current government hasn't implemented the powers that it regained using the sovereignty we repatriated - Shrimsley's analysis would have had more impact if he had recognised this. Looking forward, a new Starmer government has already had warning shots fired from Brussels that renegotiating the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement is not in the offing in 2025. The irony is that it might well take a Labour government to accrue the benefits of Brexit once it has learnt to reuse its sovereign powers for the benefit of all in the UK.
