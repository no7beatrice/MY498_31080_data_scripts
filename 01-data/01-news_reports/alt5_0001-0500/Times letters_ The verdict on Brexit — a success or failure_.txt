   Times letters: The verdict on Brexit — a success or failure? thetimes.co.uk June 20, 2024 Thursday 11:01 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 1914 words Byline: WRITE TO , LETTERS@THETIMES.CO.UK Body   Sir, Iain Martin’s article “You may hate Brexit but it’s working out well” ( Jun 20 ) is a welcome attempt to challenge Hugo Rifkind’s verdict ( “Brexit failed, right? So why’s Nigel off the hook?” , Jun 18) but contains two fallacies: first, that the binary choice we faced in 2016 was the only one; and second, that the EU would today be the same as it now is if, instead of Brexit, the UK had chosen another route. The real problem with the EU was, and remains, political union; its major benefits are union on every other level — trade, defence, health, science, technology, the arts and education. Could the UK ever have had the pros without the con? In hindsight, Maastricht was the moment the UK made the wrong choice. We will never know for sure whether Brexit was the best possible way to remedy that error, but whatever route the UK chose in 2016 would have been disruptive, to both parties.                    Nick Ritblat                    London NW8 Sir, Missing from the debate on whether Brexit has been a success or failure is the question of how it has affected Europe. Europe is a fractious, fissiparous and sometimes unlovely community of nations. But its stability, security and prosperity are vital to our own national wellbeing. The EU is the primary legislative and regulatory body in Europe, and Europe’s future depends largely on how well the EU performs its various functions. Our departure from the formal and informal systems of influence and decision-making has not helped. The UK should have remained as a strong, committed member helping to balance the federalist tendencies of some states and the bolshiness of others. The EU has been weakened by the UK’s departure and a weaker EU is less able to support the development of a stable, secure and prosperous Europe. This is undoubtedly to our own long-term detriment. Our next government must do everything possible to rebuild our influence in the EU and in Europe more widely. It is a vital strategic interest for our nation.                    David Thomas                    Great Denham, Beds  Sir, Iain Martin believes that an upside of Brexit was the restoration of sovereignty. Yet since the Windsor framework was agreed in March last year it is now accepted that Northern Ireland must remain within the EU regulatory orbit in a way that does not apply to the rest of the UK. This serves to emphasise that it was never going to be possible for the UK to leave the EU as it was supposed to, as one nation state. Surely the restoration of sovereignty was never meant to look like this?                    Graham Davies                    Bogotá, Colombia Sir, Is Brexit a failure? Hugo Rifkind and some of your correspondents ( Jun 19 ) seem to forget that many of us saw that it was important to leave an organisation that was becoming increasingly corrupt, a threat to the sovereignty of the UK parliament, and damaging to the standing of the British monarchy. For this successful outcome, a 4 per cent diminution in our long-term productivity seems a reasonable price to pay.                    Richard Wellesley                    London SW14 Disease prevention Sir, Dame Emma Walmsley is right to highlight the benefits that the NHS could gain from a greater focus on preventing disease ( “Prevention is best medicine for the NHS” , Jun 20). It was disappointing, however, that the three steps she articulates to enable this are to increase clinical trial and regulatory capacity, streamline information systems to attract more research and clinical trials, and improve access to the latest medical innovations. While all of this is commendable, where is the mention of the virtually cost-free population-level changes to prevent disease? For obesity, for example, this would involve applying measures against unhealthy and highly processed foods that have proved successful against the tobacco epidemic: taxation, advertising bans, plain packaging, point-of-sale restrictions, ending corporate sponsorship and many others. She presents disease prevention as a problem that is solvable simply through a greater use of drugs. But then, as chief executive of a global pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline, she would say that, wouldn’t she?                    John Britton                    Emeritus professor of epidemiology, University of Nottingham; Hoveringham, Notts VAT on school fees Sir, Labour’s proposed imposition of a tax on school fees should be followed by the second prong of “Morton’s Fork”. John Morton was Henry VII’s Archbishop of Canterbury and then lord chancellor in 1487. He devised a new tax that clobbered the rich on the grounds that if they had obvious wealth then they could certainly afford to pay extra taxes. But the second prong of his fork was even more sneaky: he argued that if people had no apparent wealth then clearly they were concealing their assets and therefore had enough money to pay extra tax. On this basis, perhaps Labour should introduce VAT for wealthy parents who send their children to state schools. Obviously they do not pay private school fees so they have more disposable income to tax. Better still, what is to stop any government imposing VAT on university tuition fees for overseas students? This could provide free university tuition for British students and encourage more applications from poorer families.                    John Urquhart                    Newcastle upon Tyne Sir, I have learnt that some parents of children at private schools are applying for places at their local state school with no intention of taking up the place if offered, just as your report says ( “Parents ‘scare’ councils over school fees” , Jun 6). They are encouraging other parents to do the same, so as to put pressure on Labour to drop its plan to put VAT on school fees. In fact this will block places for children whose parents do not have the financial luxury of choice and is likely to cause chaos when children fail to appear at the start of term.                    His Honour Gareth Cowling                    Alresford, Hants Housing crisis plan Sir, Regarding Ryan Prince’s Thunderer ( “Only joined-up thinking will solve our housing crisis” , Jun 18;  letters, Jun 19 ), in this age of increased working from home, and the resultant widespread release of office space, it makes sense to turn such office space into housing. However, my son, a commercial property agent, says the bottleneck in the process is the apparent lethargy of the council planning departments. If the government could enact Mr Prince’s proposals, perhaps this bottleneck would cease to exist and the crisis would be alleviated.                    Nicholas de Mattos                    Shepperton, Middx Drive for growth Sir, Juliet Samuel acutely and accurately identifies some of the bureaucratic obstacles to growth in this country ( “Why Starmer will struggle to deliver growth” , Jun 20), but her analysis is incomplete. Silos are a real issue, but the fundamental problem is the failure to resolve the contradictory objectives they reflect. We want clean rivers, but also need new houses, which will add to pollution. We want government to fund innovative projects but also intense scrutiny of public spending. Good government is not pretending that these conflicting tensions in policy do not exist. It is first acknowledging their existence and then persisting in resolving them. I worked on two “projects” in and out of government: the peace process in Northern Ireland and HS2. In one the government I worked for persisted. In the other it didn’t.                    Tom Kelly                    Prime minister’s official spokesman 2001-07; director of communications HS2 2013-19; Aghadowey, N Ireland Fujitsu’s ‘blindness’ Sir, Having owned and operated a small successful computer software company for the past 39 years I cannot accept the excuse that there were no “red flashing lights” at Fujitsu ( “Fujitsu chief: We didn’t see any red flashing lights on Horizon” , Jun 20). If we hear of a problem it is immediately entered into our database for investigation. If we hear the same from a second source its priority is increased. A third occurrence would be tantamount to a “red flashing light”. I simply cannot imagine even reaching a stage where there were more than 900 occurrences.                    Michael Gilbert                    Marlow, Bucks Church’s lost pews Sir, The Victorian Society regards the loss of pews at St Michael’s in Bath as “appalling” with “scandalous consequences” ( Jun 20 ). Not so: the church is attracting new worshippers, is utilising the freed-up pew space and has sale proceeds of £1,500 to boot.                    Hugh Purkess                    Bagendon, Glos Sex appeal Sir, The letters ( Jun 14 & 18 ) about the threat to watching cricket at Fenner’s reminded me of when I was a student at Hughes Hall College. My mother, an attractive woman, was puzzled that she had produced a daughter not noted for her looks and worried that I would not be able to attract suitors. Paying a surprise visit to the college in the summer of 1964, she was amazed to find me in my room surrounded by half a dozen attractive young undergraduates all talking to me and seeming grateful for favours I had bestowed. Reassured, she left and I never revealed to her that my bedroom had the best view of the match that was about to be played.                    Mrs Joan Olivier                    London SW19 Napoleon biopic Sir, The Cinémathèque Française and the director Georges Mourier are to be congratulated on compiling a complete version of Abel Gance’s                     Napoleon                     ( “Boney walks tall in 7-hour biopic” , Jun 19). However, the strange history of this 1927 silent masterpiece is incomplete without a record of its earlier restoration in this country by Kevin Brownlow, whose decades-long pursuit of fragments from all over the world resulted in a triumphant five-hour showing at the Empire, Leicester Square, in 1980, accompanied by the Wren Orchestra under the late Carl Davis, who wrote his own score for the project. Two years later Brownlow and Davis took the film to Le Havre, where its presentation met with further acclaim. Many more such “live” performances would follow.                    John Coldstream                    London NW8 Standing tall Sir, Like Mr and Mrs O’Hagan ( letter, Jun 20 ), I am in my seventies but take a different view about the courtesy of Londoners. While travelling on a bus with my daughter in the capital a few weeks ago a young woman offered her seat to me. I politely refused the offer but was seething inside. I see myself as fit, healthy and, most importantly, as still in my twenties.                    Keith Robinson                    Hoylake, Wirral Surfeit of Lumleys Sir, Reading Janice Turner’s Notebook ( Jun 20 ) about her collecting discarded life-sized heads reminded me of the time I was transporting five female mannequins in the back of my car from a department store in Essex to another in Taunton. All naked, wigless and with the facial image of Joanna Lumley, they caused quite a stir, seated as they were on the back seat when I was stuck in traffic.                    Rod Grant                    Long Eaton, Notts Snappy sounds Sir, As a photographer, may I add the sound of the legendary mechanical Hasselblad 500 series cameras to the list ( letters, Jun 19 & 20 )? Clunk (mirror going up), click (shutter release). A sound never forgotten.                    Paul McMullin                    Aughton, Lancs Load-Date: June 20, 2024  End of Document
