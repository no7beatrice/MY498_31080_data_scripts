   'Apology needed for misleading us'; LETTERS BREXIT Stoke The Sentinel May 25, 2024 Saturday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Local World All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 8 Length: 282 words Body   THE big question is, will Brexit be safe in Labour hands? I certainly hope not. By the sounds of it I am far from alone, with polls published by Statista this month revealing only 35 per cent of British voters still think leaving the EU was the right thing to www.do.No doubt, a Sir Keir Starmer government will try their best to 'make Brexit work', whatever that means, and I am sure Labour will rescue our country from the most damaging effects of this Tory implemented Brexit, which has sunk our economy and made immigration soar. I find it surprising to hear some of the most hard-wired Brexiteers admitting that Brexit is a failure. And it maybe something in the joy of May, mixed with the early summer brew, that loosens their tongue. Last May, Nigel Farage stunned the world by suddenly proclaiming, 'Brexit has failed' (blaming the debacle on Tory MPs). This May Sir Jim Radcliffe, multi-billionaire backer of the Brexit campaign, admitted that Brexit, 'has not turned out as expected', alluding to the government's lack of control over immigration (both legal and illegal). He also said that Sir Keir Starmer would do, a 'very good job as Prime Minister'. Yes, the tectonic plates are shifting but an apology for misleading, dividing and impoverishing our beautiful country wouldn't go amiss. I write this as the National Audit Office reveal billions being spent on new Brexit border checks, which will cripple British businesses. What other country in the world would spend billions of taxpayers' money with the result of further harming their economy? Brexit is the elephant in the room, and Labour will be better placed to acknowledge it, and I think this will be a vote winner. SJ BROOM HANLEY Load-Date: May 25, 2024  End of Document
