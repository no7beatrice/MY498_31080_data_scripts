   Brexit delays launch date of new Channel Tunnel train service to challenge Eurostar mirror.co.uk June 5, 2024 Wednesday 11:22 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: TRAVEL NEWS; Version:1 Length: 528 words Byline: By, Cyann Fielding Highlight: Eurostar will remain competitor-free for at least the next four years as rival services hoping to create a challenger channel service, experience delays in launching due to the impact of Brexit Body   Eurostar will maintain its dominance in the Channel Tunnel for at least the next four years, as rival services experience delays to launching due to Brexit. Getlink, the Paris-based company which manages the tunnel's infrastructure, has seen interest from multiple other companies hoping to start a rail service, but none of them are in a position to launch anything soon, it has been reported.  Richard Branson's Virgin Group, the Spanish rail firm Evolyn, and new Dutch operator Heuro are all believed to be interested in creating a high-speed challenger service, according to The Sunday Times. However, despite initial expectations of Evolyn launching services early next year, corporate filings from Eurostar say this is "not feasible," with 2028 considered to be the earliest possible timing of market entry. Sources told the publicationthat delays were down to greater regulatory burdens on the Channel Tunnel since Brexit. Prior to Brexit, operations were run by a single regulator known as the French-UK Intergovernmental Commission IGC. However, Brexit has meant that the system will be split. French watchdog EPSF is reportedly ready for the arrangement but the UK side, handled by the Office of Rail and Road, is not thought to be ready until next year. In addition, in order to accommodate more trains and passengers, London St Pancras would have to undergo construction works, which could take a considerable amount of time.  The domination of Eurostar has led to many in the industry believing a challenger service is long overdue and whilst potential challengers have emerged over the years, none have stuck. The firm said to have came the closest to introducing a competitor service was from Deutsche Bahn in 2010. However, the project was unable to be completed due to regulatory barriers and difficulty approving new rolling stock. In the aftermath of the impacts of Brexit and the Coronavirus pandemic, Eurostar has reduced its year-round stations from nine to six. Brexit has not only impacted competitors, but it has also changed the rules for people travelling out of London.  New rules being implemented this year mean that any Eurostar passenger from the UK, will have to use electronic kiosks before checking in for London departures. The machines at London St Pancras will register passengers' passports, scan their facial image and fingerprints and ask four questions about their trip. The new requirements come under the EU's Entry/Exit System EES, which is due to come into force on October 6. In the interview with The Times, Josh Bayliss, CEO of Virgin Group, commented: "It's a huge undertaking to establish a new operator in the industry and in that market. We're continuing to advance our preparation and delighted with progress so far".  Evolyn and Heuro have been contacted for comment. Eurostar declined to comment.
