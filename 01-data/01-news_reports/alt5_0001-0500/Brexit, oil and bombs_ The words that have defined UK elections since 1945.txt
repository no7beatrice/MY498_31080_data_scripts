   Brexit, oil and bombs: The words that have defined UK elections since 1945 The Guardian (London) June 16, 2024 Sunday 9:00 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc. All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 2454 words Byline: Michael Goodier Highlight: Guardian analysis of messaging in post-war Tory and Labour manifestos reveals shifting political focus Body   Climate change, Brexit, and Europe might have been key touchstones in previous election campaigns, but Guardian analysis shows they are given less prominence in the two main UK parties’ latest manifestos in 2024.  Looking into the text of every Conservative and Labour election manifesto dating back to 1945 shows that, while both parties still dedicate column inches to the climate emergency, these issues are less prominent than in the last election cycle. While the Labour party mentions climate issues at a higher rate (1.7 climate related terms for every 1,000 words) than the Tory manifesto does (1 in 1,000), these issues are mentioned with much less frequency than in the 2019 documents (4.4 mentions in 1,000 words for Labour and 1.1 for the Conservatives). Both the government and Labour have come in for criticism over their manifestos, both of which were published this week, from climate experts  who say that neither party is going far enough to mitigate the climate crisis. The analysis – which captures relative word frequency for every manifesto published by either party over eight decades – doesn’t consider the content of policies or the meaning of words. That means that the strength of policies, or even where each party stands on an issue, is not taken into account. However, measuring the amount of ink dedicated to different areas gives a flavour of the key topics of focus for the two parties. References to Brexit, Europe, the European Community and the other EU institutions made up less than one in every 1,000 words in both parties’ policy documents: the lowest level since 2010 for Labour or 1970 for the Conservatives. The Conservative party mentioned the word Brexit 61 times in its 2019 manifesto, which was titled “Get Brexit Done”. That fell to just 12 times in this year’s document. Labour’s new manifesto – released on Thursday and titled “It’s time for real change” – mentioned the word Brexit just once, compared with 21 times at the last election. Using a technique called “term frequency-inverse document frequency” (TFIDF), the Guardian also analysed each manifesto to find its “standout” term – not the most common word, but one which appeared the most when compared with every other manifesto. This gives a rough idea of the issues and events that most defined each election compared with others in history, and the policy areas that would have preoccupied each party leader during their time in the role outside the terms that might appear during every election such as “education” or the “economy”. This year, for the first time, the Conservatives’ standout word using TFIDF was “NHS”, a word mentioned 54 times in their manifesto. The party mentioned it in relation to immigration (“we have taken steps to ensure those coming to the UK do not place a burden on the NHS”), national service (“roles could include special constable, NHS responder or RNLI volunteer”), and gender dysphoria (“we have already stopped the routine use by the NHS of puberty blockers for gender dysphoria”), as well as talking about its core plans for the health service itself. The NHS was – less surprisingly – also the standout topic for Labour using this method, with its 52 mentions mainly focusing on the sorry state of the service  after  14 years of Conservative-led government.  The list below shows the standout words in both main parties’ manifestos since the second world war using the TFIDF analysis, each situated within a quote showing the context in which it was used. The results highlight not only how much politics has changed, but also how similar some issues are to today.                    1945                                         Clement Attlee’s Labour beats Winston Churchill’s Conservatives                    Labour: “For the Labour party is prepared to achieve it by drastic policies and keeping a firm constructive hand on our whole productive machinery;
