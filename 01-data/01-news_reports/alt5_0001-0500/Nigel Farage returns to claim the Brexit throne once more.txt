   Nigel Farage returns to claim the Brexit throne once more thetimes.co.uk June 4, 2024 Tuesday 5:45 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 845 words Byline: Tom Peck Highlight: The self-installed leader of Reform UK returns to Clacton to meet the adoring fans who followed his lead to a glorious Brexit, but one person didn’t get the memo Body   Nigel Farage walks into Clacton Wetherspoons like Sean Connery at the end of                     Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves                    . The return of the king. The prodigal son. Paul Gascoigne famously once went straight from the Wembley pitch to a pub in Hampstead, still in his full England kit. Even he won’t have got a reception quite like this one.  “Go on Nigel, my son! Get in there!” “We love you Nigel!” “Nigel! Nigel! Nigel! Nigel! Nigel! Nigel!” The scenes in the Moon and Starfish are like the bit in                     Being John Malkovich                    , where the only word anyone is capable of saying is Malkovich, over and over again, except this isn’t                     Being John Malkovich                    , it’s  Being Nigel Farage . There is, at this specific moment, very little to suggest that in about an hour he’ll be exiting the same building soon to be  covered in banana milkshake  and having to begin his open top bus tour hiding on the bottom deck with an aide and a flannel. A pint is ordered. A queue is formed for selfies with the main man. In the roughly ten-second gap between photocalls, the pint is consumed in full. When a beverage gets sucked into the Farage orbit, it does not survive for long. Later, the woman lurking by the pub steps delivers her banana-based payload in two explosive seconds. This, for Farage, is medium pace.  On the seafront, so packed in are the gathered masses that Reform UK’s brand new leader can hardly make it down the boardwalk to the pier. The bridges above the streets are standing room only. By the time he makes it down to the sea, it can’t be ruled out that at least some of the crowd are expecting him to just keep going. And did those brogues, in ancient time… There were barely 24 hours to organise Farage’s “election campaign launch” on Clacton seafront. The production values are thrillingly low. Just a stepladder, a microphone and a pier. But my word there’s a crowd.  Mainly people clap. “Bravo! Bravo!”  “Welcome to Clacton, Nigel!” It’s a town he knows well. The beaches of Clacton are Brexit’s birthing grounds, to which Farage has returned over the past decade with the rhythmic certainty of a gestating giant turtle. When  Douglas Carswell  won here for Ukip at the general election in 2015, the UK’s path out of the European Union opened up in earnest. Farage came here many times then. He was back over and over again in 2016, and again in 2019 with the Brexit Party for the European elections. They keep voting for him, over and over again, in whatever iteration he arrives. Somehow, things don’t ever seem to get better. They never quite make it to the promised land. But this time things are going to be different. This time he’s come to claim the kingdom for himself. “Brexit wouldn’t have happened without Clacton!” he shouts, and they cheer back. Eight years later, it’s not clear quite what they’re cheering about. They followed his instructions but don’t seem to have got a lot out of it. With no Brexit to sell, the Farage stump speech has taken a turn for the slightly more surreal. For the third time in four working days, he’s very angry about schools “poisoning the minds of our young people”. This week is the 80th anniversary of D-Day and, just like yesterday, he’s very annoyed that apparently  less than half of 18 to 34-year-olds  have ever heard of it. He’s here, he reckons, “to reactivate the people’s army”. On this evidence, they are very happy to be reactivated. The anti-Farage army has been reactivated too, of course. They’ve rearmed themselves with their whipped dairy weapon of choice. The great man shouts the rhetorical question, “What have I got to offer?” and in the rhetorical beat before he can move on to “blood, toil, tears and sweat” somebody shouts, “F*** all”. It must be stated though that the disapprovers are tiny in number. General election key dates — from TV debates to manifestos Round here, what Farage wants he usually gets. On Monday, the now ex-party leader Richard Tice made way for him, effectively resigning in celebration on live TV.  When the open-top bus tour begins, Farage eventually makes his way to the top deck, brow still wet. Ten rows back sits the now ex-candidate, local psychotherapist and former black cab driver, Tony Mack, jovially pointing out all the now pointless “Vote Tony Mack” signs he has been sticking up around town. Each time he does so, he risks his own life. Everyone else on board is ducked down hard into their seats, hoping to avoid decapitation by the relentless onslaught of overhanging tree branches. Outside the Three Jays pub on the edge of town, there is a moment of history. While aides fight to correctly position various pints of ale for the assembled snappers, on a beer garden table Nigel Farage formally signs his nomination papers, officially usurping Mack, who’s sitting by his side, nursing a Diet Coke and a whole load of mixed emotions. He might have won you know. But then again he might not have done. Farage on the other hand, is almost certainly going to, and that really will be history. Load-Date: June 4, 2024  End of Document
