In an interview in the Financial Times, Keir Starmer's right-hand man for economic affairs, Rachel Reeves, has acknowledged that Labour will seek "greater alignment" with Brussels, but has ruled out re-entry and a return to the single market or customs union. "We will improve our trade relations with Europe," said Reeves, who anticipated a "less confrontational" relationship than that maintained by successive Conservative governments. The aspiring Treasury Secretary has assured that she will seek "tailor-made agreements" for the chemical, veterinary, financial and cultural sectors. "I don't think anyone voted to leave the EU because they didn't agree with the regulations for the chemical sector," has argued Reeves, who campaigned for "remain" in the 2016 referendum. "In my constituency, people voted to leave solely because of immigration." Reeves' statements provoked immediate reaction in Conservative ranks. Former Brexit negotiator David Frost has stressed that people voted for Brexit "not just to end freedom of movement, but to end the rules made from Brussels." Labour and the Conservatives had so far maintained the so-called Brexit omertá, in the words of the director of the organization UK in a Changing Europe, Anand Menon: "Labour has been ahead in the polls without mentioning the relationship with the EU Why change? There is nervousness in their ranks because Starmer supported remain and is perceived as 'vulnerable' as soon as the issue is mentioned." The change in public opinion has been very noticeable in the last 8 years. Today, 58% of Britons favor returning to the EU versus 42% who favor leaving, according to the What UK Thinks polling average. According to another Datapoll poll, just one in ten Britons is able to name "a specific benefit" in their lives attributable to Brexit. In the midst of the campaign, however, even the pro-European Liberal Democrat Party has given up on putting the issue on the table, something Anand Menon himself attributes to "fatigue" among Britons and an unwillingness to reopen the thunderbox: "If the Brexit question comes up in meetings with voters, the most frequent reaction is possibly yawning." Rachel Reeves has however broken the law of silence and Keir Starmer himself will surely be forced to detail his plans. His number two, Angela Rayner, responded with a blunt "never" to the question of possible EU re-entry in recent debate. Foreign Affairs spokesman David Lammy has anticipated his willingness to negotiate a "security pact" with the EU that includes "economic and climate change security". However, Reeves has stressed the limited scope of the Brexit agreement review and has recalled the red lines that a hypothetical Labour government is not willing to cross: no to membership in the single market, no to the return to the customs union and no freedom of movement. Labour's economic spokeswoman has even ruled out the possibility of a youth mobility agreement as recently proposed by Brussels (and supported among others by London Mayor Sadiq Khan). His main emphasis will thus be on improvements for the financial sector. "Most people don't see Brexit as a great opportunity for their businesses," he acknowledged. "People working in financial services have felt quite excluded from the deal agreed at the time." The chemical and veterinary sectors are two other priorities for Labour, which will also seek "an improvement in the rights of British artists touring Europe" (in reference to the obstacles denounced by musicians and their demands for a cultural visa). Reeves has not entered the racket of the problems created since April by the entry into force of the new Brexit controls for products of animal and vegetable origin, which have caused waits of up to 55 hours at customs. Dutch truckers have threatened to stop shipping to the UK if controls are not relaxed. Farage aims to 'be a credible candidate' for prime minister in 2029 Nigel Farage, the populist leader of Reform UK, has assured his intention to become "a credible candidate for prime minister in 2029." His ambition, for the moment, is to confirm the sorpasso of the Conservative Party in the July 4 elections, to become leader of the opposition and to build "a movement in the next five years" alternative to the two big parties.  "There is a huge disconnect between Labour and the Conservatives with the country at large, with its thoughts, its hopes and its aspirations," Farage said at the launch of Reform UK's election contract. "They are far removed from ordinary people and there is no fundamental difference between them."  Farage lashed out in passing against "cultural decline" and the "poisoning" of the minds of young Britons: "We have begun to forget who we are, what our history is and what we stand for."  The leader of Reform UK promised "border control", the imposition of "zero net immigration" and the abandonment of the European Convention on Human Rights. He also called for the renunciation of the zero emissions target and the abandonment of climate policies. He defended a tax cut and "genuine economic growth" with support for small and medium-sized enterprises. He called for an increase in defense spending to 3% of GDP and a French-style "reorganization" of the National Health Service (NHS).  Farage accused the Conservative governments of having failed to capitalize on and manage the Brexit and assured that he will fight from his future seat in Westminster (if he manages to win at the eighth attempt in Clacton) so that the regulations that have survived the exit from the EU are no longer in force.  The Reform UK leader lastly called for a head-to-head contest against Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer, rather than being relegated to the minority party debates. A YouGov poll last week gave Reform UK ahead of the Conservative Party in the polls (19% to 18%). Since Farage announced his candidacy two weeks ago, the number of "reformist" militants has grown by 14,000 to 45,000.  The entry into the fray has come, however, accompanied by protests. The Reform UK leader was baptized with a banana milkshake at his first election rally in Clacton and was assaulted a week later with wet cement and a cup of coffee as he passed through Barnsley.
