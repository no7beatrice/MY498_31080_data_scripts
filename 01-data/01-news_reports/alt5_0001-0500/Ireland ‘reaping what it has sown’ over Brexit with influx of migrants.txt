   Ireland ‘reaping what it has sown’ over Brexit with influx of migrants telegraph.co.uk April 26, 2024 Friday 1:18 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:3 Length: 751 words Byline: By James Crisp, Europe Editor Highlight: Jim Allister, the leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice, blames Ireland’s insistence on keeping the border open for the rise in crossings Body   The influx of migrants crossing into Ireland from the UK  is because Dublin is “reaping what it sowed” in the Brexit negotiations, a leading unionist has said. Micheál Martin, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, has blamed the Rwanda plan  for an increase in asylum seekers entering his country from Northern Ireland. Dublin believes that more than 80 per cent of asylum seekers in Ireland have crossed the open border.  Jim Allister, the leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party, said it was not the Rwanda plan but Ireland’s insistence on keeping the border open after Brexit that was to blame. “You reap what you sow. The Republic of Ireland insisted there wouldn’t even be a camera allowed on the international frontier and now they lament the consequences of the open border they demanded,” he told The Telegraph. “It’s hard to find sympathy for those so driven by their all-Ireland agenda and poking the British over Brexit that they insisted on the very thing now swamping them with immigrants.” Mr Martin, speaking in Amman, Jordan, on Wednesday, said: “I believe the Rwanda effect is impacting on Ireland. “I don’t think anyone’s gone to Rwanda yet, but to me it’s reflective of a policy,” he said. “But it is having real impact on Ireland now in terms of people being fearful in the UK – maybe that’s the impact it was designed to have.”                      Brexit deal tensions                    Tensions over immigration  have risen in Ireland amid an increase in migrant numbers and a housing crisis. On Thursday, police arrested six people after officers came under attack by protesters at a site earmarked for asylum seekers in Newtown Mount Kennedy, Co Wicklow. Mr Allister is a fierce opponent of Rishi Sunak’s Brexit deal  for Northern Ireland, which he says puts the region’s place in the UK at risk. The Windsor Framework  kept the land border with the Republic of Ireland open after Brexit but at the price of introducing an Irish Sea border between Britain and Northern Ireland. Dublin and Brussels insisted on the deal to prevent a post-Brexit hard land border on the island of Ireland, in the negotiations to take the UK out of the EU. Ireland said the return of border infrastructure would put the peace process at risk and that a Brexit treaty was necessary to protect its place in the EU’s Single Market. Northern Ireland continues to follow hundreds of EU rules under the agreement, which also gives it lucrative dual access to both the UK and EU markets. Power-sharing was restored in Northern Ireland after negotiations ended a two-year boycott of Stormont  by the DUP over the Irish Sea border. Hard-line unionists, including the TUV, which has formed an election alliance with Reform UK, fear the deal is a precursor to an attempt to unify Ireland. Sinn Fein has called for a reunification referendum by 2030. Lord Dodds, the DUP peer, said: “The complaints from Irish politicians ring hollow. At every point in the Brexit drama they never hesitated to advance their own interests at the expense of relations with unionists and the UK. Now in true Dublin style they blame others for the consequences of policies they pursued. “Dublin has been vociferous in advocating a totally open border and has even castigated UK efforts to introduce new travel visa requirements for non Irish citizens wanting to travel from the republic into the UK through N Ireland,” he added, referring to British plans to require a permit from non-Ireland residents.” Baroness Hoey said: “The Republic of Ireland is a foreign country. It’s a bit rich for them to be complaining about something when they themselves have been the country that has refused to accept that there is a frontier with the United Kingdom and their independent country. “British taxpayers are paying for the EU single market to be protected. We’re spending all this money and putting up border posts in our own country to protect their Single market, which of course also ultimately is also affecting trade between GB and Northern Ireland,” The Brexiteer peer, who is from Northern Ireland, said. She added, “Chickens come home to roost, as they say.” Ireland and the UK are also part of a Common Travel Area that predates both countries’ EU membership. On March 22, the Irish High Court said a decision by the justice minister to designate the UK as a “safe country” after Brexit was unlawful. It said she exceeded her powers. Legislation is in the works to remedy this but in the meantime Ireland cannot use a refugee returns deal with the UK. Load-Date: April 26, 2024  End of Document
