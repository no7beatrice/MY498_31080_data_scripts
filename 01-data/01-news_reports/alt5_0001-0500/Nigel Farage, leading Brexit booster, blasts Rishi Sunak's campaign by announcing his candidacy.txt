   Nigel Farage, leading Brexit booster, blasts Rishi Sunak's campaign by announcing his candidacy CE Noticias Financieras English June 3, 2024 Monday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC. All Rights Reserved Copyright 2024 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved Length: 1104 words Body   Nigel Farage has once again abused his mastery of political showmanship - of the political circus, his critics would say - to stir up the waters of the current UK election campaign and blow up the strategy of the Conservative Party candidate, Rishi Sunak, in the process. This Monday he made a surprise announcement that, contrary to his decision just over a week ago that he would not be a candidate on July 4, he will finally run for the party he himself founded, Reform UK (Former Brexit Party). If then he justified his decision on the limited time to prepare a strategy, he has now assured that his supporters in the street have implored him to return. Until now he was the honorary chairman of the party, but it was clearly not a sufficiently relevant position for the ego of a populist whom critics and allies recognize that he has altered British politics in recent decades, since he pushed for the victory of Brexit in the 2016 referendum. Farage has ousted Reform UK's current chairman, Richard Tice, to move into that leadership role himself. "I've changed my mind. It's something that's allowed, it's not always a sign of weakness. It can even be a sign of strength. I have decided to stand in this election," he announced at a packed press conference. "My intention is to lead a political revolt, to turn my back on the current status quo, which does not work. Nothing works in this country anymore," proclaimed Farage, who has not disguised his clear intention to snatch the future role of opposition -if the polls are confirmed and Labor wins- from the Conservative Party. The candidate that the formation had selected for the Clacton constituency, for which Farage will now run, Tony Mack, is a cab driver trained as a psychotherapist and a considerable mental salad as far as his political ideas are concerned. The party leadership seemed to have forgiven him for his description of Muslims as "retarded, maladjusted and brought up to hate through Islam," but has put its foot down in the face of the character's displays of anti-Semitism. Mack had shared on his social media accounts an image of the infamous Freedom for Humanity mural that artist Kalen Ockerman, known as Mear One, painted on a street in London's East End. The aquiline-nosed figures around a Monopoly board depicted bankers Rothschild, Rockefeller or Morgan. Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was accused of anti-Semitism for backing a play that the Reform Uk candidate has used to denounce the "globalist agenda," a conspiracy theory with potent anti-Jewish content. The threat of the polls Most polls give an average of 11% of the vote to Reform UK.  In some constituencies, however, support for this formation could reach 20%. "It's the 'Farage factor'; if he comes back and gets Reform UK up two or three more points and adds traction (...) at least 10 Tory MPs would immediately jump to his side," British billionaire businessman Arron Banks, who largely financed the Brexit campaign and Farage's political career, assured the ultra-conservative GBNews this week. Although Rishi Sunak was confident of surprising his main threat from the right with the July 5 early election, hoping that Farage's party would not have enough candidates to field across the country, the move did not work out well for him. Reform UK has been able to field 630 candidates, out of a total of 650 constituencies. Unlike 2019, when Boris Johnson won a landslide election victory, partly because the then Brexit Party gave up standing in 317 constituencies where the Conservatives had a chance of winning a majority, this time the party leadership has already made it clear that it intends to compete with the Tories across the country. The Conservative defeat predicted by all the polls is also the starting signal for a bloody battle in the right-wing camp for the wreckage. "Come July 5, only one of two candidates, Keir Starmer [Labour Party] or me, will be prime minister. Any vote that does not go to the Conservative Party will end up favoring the Labour opposition," Sunak has warned in the face of Farage's turnaround. The British electoral system is majoritarian. The candidate who gets the most votes in a constituency wins that seat. The votes of his rivals in that same territory end up in the trash. That is why the participation of Reform UK (as in its day that of the Brexit Party or UKIP) does not translate into seats for these formations, but in weakening the Conservative Party option and favoring Labour. That is the reason why Farage never managed to win a seat in the House of Commons, despite trying up to seven times. The desire to inflict a humiliating defeat on the Tories in these elections, however, has led some electoral analyses - such as that of the Daily Telegraph, the favorite newspaper of the hard wing of the party - to venture that Reform UK could even win the seat in about twenty constituencies. Immigration, again Despite a camouflage rhetoric that spoke of regaining sovereignty or control in decision-making, the pro-Brexit campaign leading up to the 2016 referendum was above all a bath of xenophobia. And Farage was the one who least disguised his tirades against immigrants. His election poster to denounce the migratory pressure on the United Kingdom, in which he used a huge queue of war refugees crossing the border between Croatia and Slovenia in 2025, has already gone down in the universal history of infamy. Farage strikes again in this election, after having been one of the harshest critics against Sunak for his failed strategy of deportations to Rwanda. He has not hesitated to call the arrival of new people in the UK, whether regular or irregular, an "invasion". And he has added fuel to the fire by directing his attacks against young Muslims "who embrace increasingly radical views" and are becoming a "deeply anti-British" demographic. The Reform UK founder has found a vein of fear among many Conservative voters in the ongoing anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian protests that have swept the streets of the country's major cities in recent months. In March, Lee Anderson MP, who became deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, was suspended from the Tory parliamentary group when he refused to withdraw harsh words against London's Muslim and Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, whom he accused of being under the control of radical Islamists. Anderson responded to the suspension with his move to the ranks of Reform UK, which celebrated the episode of transfuguism as a new sign that the Tory ship was floundering.
