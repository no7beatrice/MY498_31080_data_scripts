We are speaking to voters all over the North East in the run-up to July 4. This is a significant statement by voters, as the city of Sunderland voted to leave the EU at the time of the referendum -61% leave and 39% remain. When asked if they felt any benefits of Brexit, one voter said: "No. People weren't informed what could happen. Why would you give up your biggest market "I worked with young people, they used to be able to go to university, but they can't do that now because of Brexit. Vast amounts of medication comes from Germany. I think Brexit was a protest vote against the establishment at the time, but didn't realise how it was going to affect them."

We were supposed to have all these millions back for schools, education, police, the NHS and it still hasn't come about." Other issues that were important to residents In Washington in the run-up to the general election were the NHS, education for people with disabilities, immigration and unemployment among young people. The constituents were also asked their opinion about Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Voters were split in their opinion of him. Valerie Robinson said he tries his hardest, while Christine said: "He's affable, polite, but somebody you could maybe be taken in by." However, Ian believed the Prime Minister to be man looking out for himself. Another voter said: "I don't think he realises what is actually happening at the moment. He's badly advised, he has no common sense.  "Use an umbrella or go inside when delivering a speech. Whoever's been advising him, I don't know. Taking him to the Titanic, talk about a sinking ship!" Voters were not too keen on Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer either. Valerie said she did not like him, while Christine said: "He tries to come across as a people person, but they all do that anyway to win votes." Another voter added: "He doesn't come across as charismatic, but I can see where he's coming from. He comes across like he's still in his old role as Director of Public Prosecutions, and I think he needs to move away from that." Load-Date: June 24, 2024  End of Document
