   'Brexit was an unmitigated disaster' Bucks Free Press June 16, 2024 Sunday  Copyright 2024 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Length: 237 words Byline: Letters to the Editor Body   Dear Editor, There is now a clear majority of voters who recognise that Brexit has been an unmitigated disaster. The damage its caused to the UK's GDP so far is estimated at 140 billion. The National Audit Office estimates that post Brexit customs paperwork is costing businesses an extra 7.5 billion a year. Unsurprisingly, UK exports to our main market have nosedived and the cost of imports, especially food, have risen. Not only are many of the current economic failings and issues of environmental pollution attributable to Brexit, its complications are being felt at an individual level by anyone having dealings with Europe. The restrictions and sanctions by the EU's 90 day Visa, have had a devastating effect on those wanting to work, live or study in Europe. Yet we hear nothing about it from politicians standing in this election. Whilst it is understandable that politicians who strongly advocated Brexit are now embarrassed to talk about their failed experiment, its bizarre that opposition parties have so little to say on the topic. Ironically, both Labour and the Lib Dems make the NHS a top priority, without addressing its loss of staff caused by Brexit. They both need to get off the fence and make it clear where they stand on this crucial issue, and more importantly, what they intend to do about it. Addressing it in 10 years time is no consolation for those feeling the effects of it now. Alex Wilson, High Wycombe Load-Date: June 16, 2024  End of Document
