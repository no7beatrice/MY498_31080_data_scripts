   Brexit allowed the UK to respond quicker than EU states to Russian aggression in Ukraine, Polish foreign minister claims MailOnline May 18, 2024 Saturday 5:10 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 709 words Byline: Cameron Roy Body                        Brexit allowed the UK to respond quicker than EU states to Russian aggression in Ukraine, the Polish foreign minister has claimed. Radoslaw Sikorski said that the UK could move faster as it did not have to reach a consensus in a 27-member bloc on issues such as what sanctions to issue against the Kremlin and what aid to give Ukraine. The experienced politician, who went to Oxford University with Boris Johnson and Lord Cameron, said the UK had found a very useful and honourable 'niche' due to its quick decision-making. He told The Telegraph: 'You do the right thing before others, and therefore encourage the rest of us.' He has backed Ukraine to win the war and reiterated the call from Lord Cameron, his fellow Bullingdon Club member at university, for Nato members to boost their spending on defence to the two per cent target.                      Poland, which shares a long border with Russia, Ukraine and close Russian ally Belarus, is now spending four per cent of its GDP on defence. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has pledged to raise the UK's spending to 2.5 per cent. Mr Sikorski said Poland was leading by 'example' and was now spending the highest proportion in Nato, including the United States. He said he expects the 'overwhelming majority' of members to hit the decade-old spending target by the upcoming Nato summit in July. He told the paper: 'Let me remind you that we only have a European defence budget as a benefit of Brexit - because before Brexit, as you know, Britain consistently vetoed [it].' But he added that the UK had kept a security leadership role in Europe after Brexit and had done a 'great job' over Ukraine. Mr Sikorski also praised his university colleague Boris Johnson, who he said was 'ahead of the curve on Ukraine'. As prime minister Mr Johnson was one of the first political leaders to visit Ukraine after it was invaded. The ring-wing politician also praised his opposite number in the UK Lord Cameron, who he said the Polish security services collaborate with closely. However earlier this month his boss, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk made international news when he claimed Poles will be richer than Brits by 2030 because 'it's better to be in the EU'. The Brexit-hating politician, 67, vowed to accelerate the country's economic growth, potentially leading to a higher GDP per capita than that of post-Brexit Britain within just five years. Poland's PM was the European Council president during Brexit negotiations and was known for his extreme criticism of the decision to leave the EU. He took the figures from a forecast by Keir Starmer's Labour Party based on World Bank data that said Poland would outstrip the UK in GDP per capita by 2030.  'A fierce debate is taking place in Great Britain caused by the World Bank's forecast that GDP per capita will be higher in Poland than in the UK in 2025,' Tusk said in a post to X, formerly Twitter. 'And I promise it: on the 25th anniversary, Poles will be richer than Brits. It's better to be in the European Union,' he added.  Tusk is now in his second stint as prime minister - a job he had left to become European Council president in December 2014 - after getting elected at the Polish general election last year.  During a 2019 trip to Brussels, Tusk sparked fury when he said there is a 'special place in hell' for people who pushed for Brexit without a plan.  Last month Rishi Sunak visited Poland to meet with Tusk for talks about aid for Ukraine.  In a joint speech, the Tory leader and Polish PM said 'we are allies in the long term', following a £500 million pledge in military aid for Ukraine by the British government. 'We will never forget in Britain that it was Polish pilots that gave their lives to protect our country in the Battle of Britain,' they said. 'And today we're proud to stand together as NATO allies. Two of Europe's biggest military powers. Two of Ukraine's firmest friends.' Sunak added: 'And across Europe, I think Poland and the UK are part of a growing wave of countries that are taking greater responsibility for our collective security. 'Poland is spending more of its GDP on defence than any NATO ally in Europe. 'And with today's announcement, the UK will be spending more in cash terms than any NATO ally in Europe.'
