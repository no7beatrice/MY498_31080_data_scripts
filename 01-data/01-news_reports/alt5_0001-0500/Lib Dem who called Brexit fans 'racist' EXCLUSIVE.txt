   Lib Dem who called Brexit fans 'racist'; EXCLUSIVE The Express June 13, 2024 Thursday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Express Newspapers All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 8,9 Length: 204 words Byline: Sam Stevenson Body   A LIB DEM candidate in a Leavebacking area called all Brexit voters "xenophobic" and "narrow-minded" in now-deleted Facebook posts. David Chalmers, running against ex-Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay, said Leave voters should be put "firmly back in the box where they belong". In the unearthed posts he claims he has "no friends who voted Leave" and wants "nothing to do with people of that kind".The rants have been uncovered by the Daily Express three weeks before Mr Chalmers tries to oust Environment Secretary Mr Barclay from his 70% Leave-backing North-East Cambridgeshire seat. Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said: "It shows contempt for voters and is a reminder that the holier-than-thou Lib Dems are neither liberal nor democratic." Mr Barclay said: "I backed Leave in the EU referendum and was proud to sign the Brexit deal.We need to make the most of our independence and the opportunities created by Brexit to give this country a great future." Mr Chalmers apologised for the "use of any language that has caused offence" when the comments first came to light in 2019. He has also deleted many of his Facebook rants - but local campaigners kept a record of his outrageous posts. The Lib Dems and Mr Chalmers were approached for comment.
