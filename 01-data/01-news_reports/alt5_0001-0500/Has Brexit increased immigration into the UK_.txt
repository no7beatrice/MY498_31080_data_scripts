   Has Brexit increased immigration into the UK? CE Noticias Financieras English June 27, 2024 Thursday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC.

The campaign slogan for Brexit, the UK's exit from the European Union, was seen by many as a call to take back control of immigration policy, ending the possibility for citizens of the European bloc to live, work and study freely in the UK. But in the years since Brexit, the country has recorded one of the fastest population growths since the 1960s, making migration one of the main themes of the next UK general election, scheduled for July 4. But what happened? To understand the issue of immigration in the UK, the coastal town of Skegness in England can be a good starting point. There, more than three quarters of the population voted to leave the European Union. As in many parts of the UK, when it comes to immigration, much of the focus is on those arriving illegally in the country. "Stop The Boats" is a key pledge of the governing Conservative Party, a reference to the tens of thousands of people who make the perilous crossing of the English Channel, often in inflatable boats of dubious quality. Despite the fact that none of these boats have ever landed on the beaches of Skegness, this is an issue of concern to the town. Several seafront hotels were used until recently to house asylum seekers while their applications were processed. Julieanne Bunce, who manages the North Parade Hotel, says that this causes problems in the community. "They haven't caused us any inconvenience," she says. "(But) the general feeling in the Skegness area was that people didn't want them here." The vast majority of asylum seekers have already been removed from the hotels, but local concerns about the impact of migration remain. Large majority migrate legally You might imagine, therefore, that the record increase in immigration has been driven mainly by people arriving illegally in the UK. But that's not true. In 2022, the migration balance - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving the UK each year - is estimated to have hit an all-time high of 745,000 people. In 2023, the figure is believed to have been 672 thousand. That same year, 30,000 people arrived in small boats. The vast majority of those arriving in the UK do so legally. They are people like Kiki Ekweigh, who works in an assisted living complex in Skegness. While doing her rounds, she knocks on a door. "Hi, it's cheeky Kiki!" she says, laughing, as she enters. "Being a caregiver is not an easy job. You have to have mental balance, you have to have empathy, you have to have a lot of patience," she says. Kiki migrated from Nigeria to the UK, initially to study at university, but stayed on to work. Students and health and care professionals like Kiki accounted for around two thirds of the visas granted by the UK last year. According to Oxford University's Migration Observatory, they are the main drivers behind the increase in the migration balance since the 2010s. The numbers of arrivals, which former Prime Minister Boris Johnson called "scandalous" when they were at a much lower level than they are now, are therefore actually largely the result of deliberate political decisions by the government. So what is going on? The truth is that successive governments have calculated that the UK needs migrants. Foreign students pay much higher tuition fees, essentially subsidizing domestic students. If the number of foreign students fell, UK students might have to pay more; or universities might go bust; or the government would need to fund them. None of this would be popular. What's more, many sectors of the UK economy, not least health and social care, are desperately short of manpower. One in five of the 1.5 million people working in the NHS, the UK's public health service, are foreign nationals. But despite the increase in immigration, there were still 150,000 vacancies in the health sector last year. The Brexit effect Although it's surprising that leaving the European Union coincided with an increase in immigration, Brexit has reduced the number of one group. In the 12 months to June 2023, the migration balance from the European bloc was -86,000, meaning that more EU citizens left the UK than arrived. But they were more than replaced by people arriving from the rest of the world. Around 250,000 people arrived from India, and just under 150,000 from Nigeria. China, Pakistan and Zimbabwe follow as the most common places of origin. Stop the Boats Despite this, it is the illegal arrivals that have dominated political discourse in the UK. In the midst of the election period, "Stop the Boats" became a frequently used campaign slogan. The current Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, has made it one of his five priorities. To tackle the issue, he has drawn up a plan to send some asylum seekers who arrive illegally to Rwanda. But the opposition Labor Party is promising to abandon this plan. Instead, it wants to establish a new Border and Security Command to help remove disqualified asylum seekers. And the newly created Reform UK (radical right party) has promised a zero-tolerance approach, including withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights. Does the UK receive more migrants than other countries? The UK is broadly in line with other high-income countries when it comes to migration. In 2022, 14% of people living in the UK were classified as "foreign-born" - a similar percentage of the population to countries like the US and the Netherlands. But when we look at countries like Canada, New Zealand and Australia, we see a different picture emerging. In Australia, for example, the foreign-born population is around double that of the UK, as a percentage of the population. Difficult concessions And so we return to our original question: why is the UK's migration balance so high, eight years after leaving the European Union? The reality is that migration has not just been driven by freedom of movement. The UK economy has needed migration, despite the political rhetoric. Many of the decisions that would be needed to significantly reduce the number of people arriving in the UK would require difficult concessions, which the government has been reluctant to make. Illegal migration, especially via dangerous routes, is something that all parties are comfortable opposing - and the focus of the discussion ends up falling on it. Back in Skegness, Kiki is aware of this. "I watch the news so I don't totally ignore what's going on," she says, when asked about the immigration debate, as she passes the town's seaside attractions. "If people have negative impressions, that has been misinterpreted, in my opinion. I don't think they're really aware of the reality of what's happening in practice. I think they have the wrong perception." Did you like the article?
