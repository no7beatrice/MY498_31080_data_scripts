   Brits face higher grocery bills as retailers warn post-Brexit border checks coming into force today mean they will have to put up the price of food imported from the EU MailOnline April 30, 2024 Tuesday 8:25 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:2 Length: 1211 words Byline: Emily Jane Davies Body   Meat, dairy, plants and seeds will have more checks when imported from the EU Brits are facing higher grocery bills as post-Brexit border checks coming into force today mean the price of food imported from the EU will go up, retailers have warned. Meat, dairy, plants and seeds are just some of the products which will now be subject to physical checks when imported in. Companies have warned that the new checks will likely hit small businesses hardest and lead to price rises for customers. The measures are a part of the UK's Brexit trade agreement, and the government says they will increase the country's bio-security and the added cost will be 'negligible' compared to a major outbreak of disease. The border checks will be carried out according to the risk category of the product, such as 'high-risk' live animals being subject to checks for pests and diseases. For now, the checks won't apply to goods from the Republic of Ireland, which is a major supplier. This won't happen until November, the government said.  The measures which are now in place were delayed previously due to concerns in the UK about fuelling the rampant cost-of-living crisis by adding more red tape to food imports.  Goods from Britain have faced EU controls since the start of 2021, with the UK Government introducing new requirements for animal and plant products coming from the other direction. The new checks could interrupt supply chains and increase prices, with importers having to pay £29 per shipment for some products.

This could cost British companies around £330m a year, the government estimated.  About a quarter of the UK's food imports pass through Dover and the Channel Tunnel. The introduction of post-Brexit border checks has been delayed several times over fears they could fuel inflation. Food inflation has fallen over the last year, reaching five per cent in February after hitting 19.6 per cent in March 2023, its highest recorded level for 45 years. Labour MP Stella Creasy told the Commons: 'Whether you supported or opposed Brexit nothing being proposed here is inevitable or unavoidable. 'Having left the EU we do need border controls, but what is being proposed won't be controlled, it will be chaos.' The MP for Walthamstow said the proposed measures amounted to a 'Brexit border tax'. She said: 'From Wednesday for the first time, 2.7 million lorries will need to be stopped at Dover so their contents can be checked and another four million will require a health certificate for the animal products they carry. 'On top of this five million of them will have to pay a common user charge for the privilege of importing goods deemed medium or high risk - whether or not they're inspected. 'The costs to business, which we know will be passed onto consumers, are horrendous and chaotic, these charges only being confirmed on April 18. 'The Government has admitted that this will cause inflation but they claim it's only £300 million over 0.2 per cent over three years, independent analysis shows it will be ten times that, or £8 a month on the average food shop.' Ms Creasy added: 'With 36 hours to go we need some straight answers. Our constituents can't eat the paperwork this will create, nor afford the price rises it will increase.'

He said: 'For low risk goods there is a £10 charge for those products, capped at a maximum of five products, so the maximum you could have on a low-risk product lorry load would be £50. '(Ms Creasy) is right in that we have calculated that over three years we think that will lead to about 0.2 per cent on food inflation, if you compare that to the cost of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, which cost this country £12 billion, not alone, the impact that would have on international trade and our reputation as a country, I think it is a small price to pay for making sure that we are safe and protected.' The Government has previously said an outbreak of African Swine Fever would be a 'fundamental threat to the viability' of the UK's pig industry. While Britain is free of African Swine Fever, it is widespread in some other parts of the world, including both EU and non-EU countries on the European Continent. Shadow Defra minister Daniel Zeichner described the plans as a 'mess', and questioned if the checks would have the necessary funding to protect against diseases. He said: 'Here we are on April 29 with the new checks being introduced tomorrow and the businesses involved unclear on how the system's supposed to operate.' He added: 'It's baffling that in the battle against (African) Swine flu at Dover, the minister is taking away vital funding.' Sir Mark replied: 'If you tried to do something illegal then of course you will be picked up by border force, at the port of Dover via inspection and by intelligence led inspection. '(Mr Zeichner) said there's no money when actually we are in conversation with the port of Dover to resolve that.' SNP Defra spokesperson Steven Bonnar, said the checks would be 'highly damaging for industry and consumers'. He said: 'Does (Sir Mark) accept the significant disruption being faced is not only a symptom of the Government's disastrous delivery of these checks but indeed of Brexit itself?' Sir Mark said the Government had approached the issue in a 'pragmatic' and 'proportionate' way. He said: 'We've taken our time to get it right, and I don't apologise for taking that time to make sure that the system we're going to introduce tomorrow is proportionate and pragmatic, and we will listen to those companies that are going to be using those systems to make sure we get it right and it works. 'That's why we're ramping this up at a pace that is slow but steady, to make sure we get to the right place at the right time to keep this country safe from any disease.' Commenting on how today's Brexit border checks could add billions to consumer bills, Mark Lynch, Partner at corporate finance house to the consumer industries, Oghma Partners, said: 'Despite all the protestations from the food manufacturing and retail industries and years of delay, the government has insisted on introducing border checks for what, pre Brexit, was considered OK to import without checks.  'The evidence suggests that these checks will be introduced in a half-hearted manner, will reduce choice and increase costs. Anyone determined to avoid the checks will be able to do so by diverting goods on the 20 mile plus inland journey to the post Dover checking area. Most rational observers would suggest this is taking Brexitism too far.'  Load-Date: April 30, 2024  End of Document
