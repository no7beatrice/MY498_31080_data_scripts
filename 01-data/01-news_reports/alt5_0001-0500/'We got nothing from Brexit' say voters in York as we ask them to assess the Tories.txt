   'We got nothing from Brexit' say voters in York as we ask them to assess the Tories examiner.co.uk June 21, 2024 Friday 2:49 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: TOPIC -N YORKS; Version:2 Length: 637 words Byline: By, Alanah Hammond & Wayne Ankers Highlight: Even people who voted for Brexit said it was a loss -we spoke to people in York ahead of the 2024 General Election Body   YorkshireLive has been heading out to constituencies in Yorkshire, asking voters to evaluate the performance of the Conservative government and their concerns for the general election. In North Yorkshire, we asked voters in the city centre of York if they had seen any benefits from Brexit. Unanimously, nine voters all agreed they could not see any benefits from Brexit. Some voters confidently said no but others contemplated if they could think of any positives from the Brexit decision. Liam Bell, 35, remarked: "I don't think so... not really... I'm not really sure what benefits we gained from Brexit".

He said: "No, I think it was a loss when we accepted Brexit, although I voted for it". With Brexit being a key manifesto point for Boris Johnson in the 2019 election, we asked voters what good the Conservatives have done in York since coming into power. Much like their response to Brexit, the voters of York were negative about the work of the Conservative government for their city. Most said "little" or "not much" or couldn't even think of an answer - Kevin said "I have no idea". Chris Walker, 70, was the only voter who gave a somewhat positive response: "For York and the whole country during Covid I thought they did a good job... that's about it really" York Central Constituency has a Labour MP, Rachael Maskell, so it made sense that most voters thought a Labour government would make York a better place to live. Gina, 20, and Dave, 60, from York, both agreed Labour would be better for York. Gina explained: "York is such a wealthy city and there's loads of people with loads of money and second properties - Labour wants to tax that which means York doesn't become such a lucrative place and its [wealth is] spread out more." Dave agreed, saying: "Yes. Local housing for local people is what we need". Gina added, "Yeah because all the people that actually live in York and are born in York cannot actually afford to live in York." YorkshireLive was keen to hear what mattered most to voters in York. Common election issues included tackling the cost of living crisis, dealing with illegal immigration, the NHS, and sorting the economy. For York resident Helen, 58, health and social care are the most important election issues. Helen said this is because her daughter has a disability and complex health issues. We asked Helen if she thought the government was doing enough for neurodivergent or disabled people. Helen said: "No, I think we have set the clock back at least 20 years and where you were able to access services you're just made to feel like you're asking for the moon." Helen continued: "People will tell you within services there is no money but as parents and carers of a young person who is not able to care for themselves, we still need that support".  York held a Question Time election special on Thursday evening in Heslington, an area in York Central Constituency. Rishi Sunak and Kier Starmer faced questions after Ed Davey and John Swinney. Both election issues raised by York residents - immigration targets and NHS waiting lists - were discussed.
