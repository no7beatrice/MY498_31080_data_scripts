   Own goals seem to have cost the Tories, but Labour should beware thetimes.co.uk June 16, 2024 Sunday 11:01 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 1148 words Byline: Simon French Highlight: Global issues have contributed to the chaos of recent years, but so, too, have a mismanaged Brexit and an arrogant mini-budget Body   There was an intriguing line in last week’s Labour Party manifesto. It came early in the piece, in only the second sentence. It described the general election on July 4 as “a chance to stop the endless Conservative chaos that has directly harmed the finances of every family in Britain”.  This is a Labour Party that has learnt the lesson of the 2010 election, when David Cameron and George Osborne successfully pinned the global financial crisis on Labour’s economic mismanagement. Fourteen years on and the issues may be different, but the tactics are the same. And timeless. But how justified is the accusation? And what in the Labour manifesto is suggested as a credible alternative? The first thing to say is that the accusation of chaos will resonate with the electorate. Over the past 14 years there have been a series of large economic shocks that have stretched the public finances and have led to sluggish growth in household incomes. When Liam Byrne, Labour’s outgoing chief secretary to the Treasury, wrote his infamous letter in 2010 stating “I’m afraid there is no money”, the UK’s public debt stood at £1.03 trillion; today that figure stands at £2.69 trillion. The fallout from the financial crisis to Brexit, the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and Liz Truss’s mini-budget presented a litany of challenges to stable governance and healthy public finances. While the “Securonomics” agenda proposed by Rachel Reeves has been accused in some quarters of lacking ambition, voters appear to be tacking towards something, indeed anything, that appears less chaotic. Yet, as with 2010, a 2024 economic scorecard should fairly assess how much of the harm to family finances is directly attributable to government policy. Much as Gordon Brown did not repeal American laws on sub-prime lending and foster the opaque financial securitisation that triggered a credit crunch, neither did recent Conservative prime ministers, including Truss and Rishi Sunak, create the conditions for a 23 per cent rise in consumer prices, nor a 5 per cent increase in mortgage interest rates. Across Europe, consumer prices have gone up by a similar magnitude to those in Britain, by more than a fifth since the start of the Covid pandemic. Mortgage interest rates in the United States are now hovering about 7 per cent. A co-ordinated increase in food and energy prices, and interest rate increases to counter those rise, are not the result of domestic policy failures. Governing parties largely got smashed in last week’s  European parliamentary elections .  President Biden is scrambling for momentum  ahead of his November date with the ballot box.  The problem for any Conservative trying to defend the government’s economic record is that alongside these global shocks, triggering political punishment for all incumbents, are a couple of “Made in Britain” events that also have damaged the nation’s economic performance. These are far harder to shake off. The first of these is the handling of Brexit. The second is the arrogance and ignorance that underpinned the mini-budget. Let’s take Brexit first . While the economic damage has not been as headline-grabbing as some of the pre-referendum analysis predicted, Brexit has hit trade, stifled business investment and suppressed the value of UK assets. Moreover, to offset the labour market shock from the end of European Union free movement of workers, there was an easing of inward migration rules that, initially at least, has pushed down per capita GDP. Brexit was an event and a fallout that Conservatives must own. It was on their watch, was their political project, is their damage. When looking for idiosyncratic shocks not experienced by other leading economies, Brexit is towards the top of the list.  In the interests of balance, the only thing to note is that  the Labour Party manifesto  makes little attempt to suggest concrete alternatives. The document waits until page 117 until its only mention of Brexit. This is not a great portent for an incoming administration  keen to address deep-seated economic issues  riddled with knotty trade-offs. The second of the self-inflicted wounds is 2022’s mini-budget. Accusations have been made that the increase in Britain’s mortgage rates over the past two years has been the result of the mini-budget. Except for a small number of individuals forced to refinance their home loan over a few weeks in the autumn of 2022, this is largely nonsense. There was a co-ordinated increase in borrowing rates around the world.  No, the real failing of that period was the final episode of an institutional scorched earth policy, a series that began with Brexit, during which parliament and the judiciary came under attack, culminating in a mini-budget that sidelined the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Bank of England and the Treasury. Investors looked on and concluded that the UK government was uncomfortable with the checks and balances on executive control. It was not a good look.  It also spoke of government ministers, who, despite a dozen years in power, had failed to work out a golden ratio in UK politics. Good governance is 20 per cent about designing policy and 80 per cent about how it is delivered. And I may be overstating the 20 per cent. As I have noted in these pages before, much of what Truss was proposing was a sensible counter to a supply side of the domestic economy that has become sclerotic, slow and inefficient. But the ignorance of our political class stems from too many of our MPs gaining their experience at think tanks, in the study of political economy and as special advisers. Too few have delivered policy. Who of those advocating 350,000 new homes a year has actually built a house? Who advocating a net zero energy grid has secured planning permission for a grid connection? Who in parliament has undertaken a digital transformation of a customer service business? Ultimately, this issue is what will determine whether an incoming Labour government would succeed or fail in turning around the country’s economic fortunes. Would it surround itself with those who understand the barriers to efficient delivery of public services? Would the proposed “Mission Boards” be filled with vested political interests or applied expertise? Would devolution of powers truly strip out a layer of interference or simply add another? Too many self-inflicted wounds appear to have done for a Conservative government that has also been unlucky with economic events beyond its control. As Richie Benaud, the former Australia cricket captain, once dryly observed: “Captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill. But don’t try it without that 10 per cent.” Captain Starmer and Lieutenant Reeves should remember that advice when events beyond their control inevitably hit.
