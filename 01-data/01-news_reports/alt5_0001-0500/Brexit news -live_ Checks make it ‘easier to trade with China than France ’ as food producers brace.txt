   Brexit news -live: Checks make it ‘easier to trade with China than France’ as food producers brace for cost rise The Independent (United Kingdom) January 31, 2024 Wednesday 9:16 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: UK POLITICS,UK; Version:19 Length: 4184 words Byline: Joe Middleton Highlight: Businesses have expressed concerns about disruption to supply chains due to Brexit Body   Small businesses have warned that new post-Brexit checks mean it is easier to import from China than it is to trade with France, as food producers brace themselves for escalating costs. The new rules implemented today mean that health certificates will now be needed on a wide range of EU goods  such as meat, fruit and vegetables. A further system for physical checks at the border is coming into force on 30 April. Nigel Jenny from the Fresh Produce Consortium (FPC) warned that the checks for food and plant importers is essentially a £200million tax on the industry and it will increase prices for consumers. Paolo Arrigo, managing director of Seeds of Italy, told The Independent that the new checks were “anti-small business” and that it was now easier to import from China than France. Conservative health minister Dame Andrea Leadsom however played down concerns about more red tape, saying that checks at the UK/EU border are the “price you pay” for leaving the EU. She told Times Radio: “It was very clear in the Brexit discussions a long time ago now, today is the fourth anniversary of leaving the EU, it was very clear that we would be leaving the single market.”                      Key Points                                                                Brexit checks make it ‘easier to trade with China than France’                       FSB raises concerns of ‘disproportionate impact of fees’ that could hit small businesses                       Minister brushes off Brexit check costs as ‘price you pay for being sovereign state again’                       No 10 says new £3bn Brexit deal with DUP doesn’t need EU approval                       Labour vows to 'review' Brexit deal in government                                                              Government to fast-track legislation through Commons to deliver on Stormont deal                    The government  aims to fast-track two pieces of legislation through parliament on Thursday to deliver on the commitments made in its package aimed at restoring powersharing at Stormont.  It comes a day after the publication of measures that would end routine post-Brexit checks on goods shipped from Great Britain to final destinations in Northern Ireland. Full report:  Government to fast-track legislation through Commons to deliver on Stormont deal                      Now Boris tries to sabotage his own bungled Brexit deal with new attack on Sunak                    Boris Johnson has attacked Rishi Sunak’s new Brexit deal with the DUP – warning that it could tie the UK to EU rules on the trade of goods in future. Mr Sunak’s government has set out its deal with the DUP to remove routine checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland in a bid to restore powersharing at Stormont. The so-called “green lane” process – which requires percentages of goods to be checked in NI as they arrive from GB – will be rebranded as the “UK internal market system”.                        Adam Forrest reports. Boris Johnson tries to sabotage his bungled Brexit deal in new attack on Sunak                      Boris Johnson celebrates four years of Brexit                    Boris Johnson marked four years since Brexit took effect with a warning of any watering down of the current arrangements. It comes with the government set to publish the details of its deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), setting the stage for the return of the Stormont powersharing institutions. But some Tories have concerns it could limit the UK’s post-Brexit freedom to diverge from EU rules. The former prime minister, in a post on X, hit out at “artificial” concerns about the border on the island of Ireland and warned against any return to the kind of deal pushed unsuccessfully by Theresa May. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he said: “Four years on from Brexit we celebrate the restoration of this country’s democratic power to make its own laws and rules. “With those Brexit freedoms we have introduced improved standards for animal welfare, cut taxes on sanitary products, created greater flexibility for cutting edge industries from financial services to bioscience, done many global free trade deals -and it was at least partly thanks to Brexit that this country had the fastest covid vaccine rollout in Europe. “We must retain the appetite and the courage to diverge from the low-growth high-regulation European model. “We must at all costs avoid a return to anything remotely like the disastrous ‘Chequers’ formula whereby artificial concerns about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland are used to keep the whole of the UK in alignment with EU rules.”                      Labour will look again at EU relationship if businesses are ‘struggling’ with new checks                    Labour said the party, should it win this year’s expected general election, would look again at the trading relationship with Brussels if businesses are “struggling” with the new checks. Tulip Siddiq, a shadow Treasury minister, told Sky News: “If there are things that aren’t working, then of course we need to review it and look at it. “We would look at look at where businesses are struggling, where the economy is struggling, and go and see if we can get a better deal for our country. “That is what anyone who is in charge should be doing. “They (voters) may have voted to leave the European Union, but they didn’t vote to get a bad deal.”                      Brexit a ‘seismic moment’ and will take time to ‘filter through’, says minister                    Brexit was a “seismic moment in British politics” and “something of that magnitude is going to take time to filter through”, Cabinet minister Victoria Atkins said. The health secretary told reporters that the Covid vaccine rollout was an example of Britain’s ability to move quicker than the EU after leaving the bloc. She said: “I’ll give you one very positive example of how being free from the EU enabled us to make real change to our society and that, of course, was through the vaccination programme during Covid. “We were able to come out of lockdown faster than any other country, because we were able to make those decisions about the vaccination programme and roll it out as quickly as we did.” She claimed the pharmaceutical industry viewed the UK’s position outside the EU as a “real game changer for them” and “I think we really are going to see some really exciting opportunities in the years ahead of us to the things”.                      FSB raises concerns of ‘disproportionate impact of fees’ that could hit small businesses                    The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has raised concerns about the “disproportionate impact of fees” that could land on small businesses when physical checks at the border come into force on 30 April. Tina McKenzie, policy chair at the group, said:“We are concerned that some UK small importers might still be in the dark about the import checks that came into effect on 31 Jan.  While we’ve been urging small firms to get ready for the changes and talk to their EU suppliers, there’s a need for UK Government to monitor implementation closely over the coming days and weeks and take steps to address issues that impact on trade flows.  “Groupage shipments, often used by small businesses importing small quantities, are particularly vulnerable to disruption.  “In terms of physical checks coming into effect from April, there are concerns around the disproportionate impact of fees for these checks on small businesses and confusion over how the checks will be carried out, which might affect the quality of imported goods. We’d like clarity from the Government on these areas as soon as possible.” The FSB are the largest organisation representing small and medium sized businesses in the UK and have around 200,000 members.                      57 per cent of people think Brexit is more a failure than a success                    A new poll from Ipsos Mori indicates that 57 per cent of respondents say Brexit is more a failure than a success.

He said that the new rules will lead to four significant problems; delays, reduced consumer choice, increased costs and more bureaucracy.“For the UK seed industry this is devastating and is just further bureaucracy and costs that we don’t need...We are a small business and there are six of us, we do not have to time for extra paperwork that’s needed.“If you are a big company with thousands of employees you can just hire someone to sort the additional measures that are needed, but for small businesses it is a real drain on our time.”Mr Arrigo added: “If we had stayed in the Single Market we would not have been having even a tiny proportion of the problems we are seeing now.”He said that ever since the UK left the EU trade had become increasingly difficult with the continent.“When we first started with all of this nonsense we had two deliveries returned to Italy. One was because it was with the wrong palette. And another was returned because it was not written in the correct colour of black. These issues did not happen when we had the freedom to trade.”£200million price hike for fresh food and vegetablesWednesday 31 January 2024 15:43 , Joe Middleton Nigel Jenny from the Fresh Produce Consortium (FPC) has warned that post Brexit checks for food and plant importers will increase costs for businesses.He told BBC breakfast: “The £200m is a tax in essence by the UK government to manage this process”.He added that these increased costs will be passed onto consumers in the form of price increases for fresh produce.'The £200m is a tax in essence by the UK Government to manage this process' Nigel Jenny from the Fresh Produce Consortium told #BBCBreakfast  new post Brexit checks for food and plant importers, which begin today, will be passed on to consumershttps://t.co/iFxUImLecV pic.twitter.com/fsBBSP1YVO — BBC Breakfast (@BBCBreakfast) January 31, 2024 UK government is ‘Brexit-betraying’, says DUP MPWednesday 31 January 2024 14:45 , Joe Middleton The UK government has been accused of being spineless, weak-kneed and “Brexit-betraying” by a DUP MP.Speaking in the Commons, Sammy Wilson, MP for East Antrim, said: “When the Northern Ireland assembly sits, ministers and assembly members will be expected by law to adhere to and implement laws which are made in Brussels, which they had no say over and no ability to amend, and no ability to stop.“This is a result of this spineless, weak-kneed, Brexit-betraying Government, refusing to take on the EU and its interference in Northern Ireland.”He added: “Is Northern Ireland going to find it’s got the ability to stay tied to the United Kingdom, or will the Government proceed happily to change laws here regardless of the impact it has on Northern Ireland?”Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris replied: “On the fourth anniversary of leaving the European Union, I can tell him absolutely that this agreed package of measures will not change the freedoms and powers we have secured through Brexit or through the Windsor framework.Labour will look again at EU relationship if businesses are ‘struggling’ with new checksWednesday 31 January 2024 13:51 , Joe Middleton Labour said the party, should it win this year’s expected general election, would look again at the trading relationship with Brussels if businesses are “struggling” with the new checks.Tulip Siddiq, a shadow Treasury minister, told Sky News: “If there are things that aren’t working, then of course we need to review it and look at it.“We would look at look at where businesses are struggling, where the economy is struggling, and go and see if we can get a better deal for our country.“That is what anyone who is in charge should be doing.“They (voters) may have voted to leave the European Union, but they didn’t vote to get a bad deal.”Boris Johnson celebrates four years of BrexitWednesday 31 January 2024 12:51 , Joe Middleton Boris Johnson marked four years since Brexit took effect with a warning of any watering down of the current arrangements.It comes with the government set to publish the details of its deal with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), setting the stage for the return of the Stormont powersharing institutions.But some Tories have concerns it could limit the UK’s post-Brexit freedom to diverge from EU rules.The former prime minister, in a post on X, hit out at “artificial” concerns about the border on the island of Ireland and warned against any return to the kind of deal pushed unsuccessfully by Theresa May.In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he said: “Four years on from Brexit we celebrate the restoration of this country’s democratic power to make its own laws and rules.“With those Brexit freedoms we have introduced improved standards for animal welfare, cut taxes on sanitary products, created greater flexibility for cutting edge industries from financial services to bioscience, done many global free trade deals -and it was at least partly thanks to Brexit that this country had the fastest covid vaccine rollout in Europe.“We must retain the appetite and the courage to diverge from the low-growth high-regulation European model.“We must at all costs avoid a return to anything remotely like the disastrous ‘Chequers’ formula whereby artificial concerns about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland are used to keep the whole of the UK in alignment with EU rules.”Four years on from Brexit we celebrate the restoration of this country’s democratic power to make its own laws and rules.

Rishi Sunak’s government has been warned of major supply problems with EU meat and dairy products when extra red tape and inspections are imposed on imports from April. Some suppliers of specialist products, like French cheeses, will give up on Britain because of the extra expense and “huge hassle” involved in sending goods, say industry bosses.                        Adam Forrest reports. Parma hams and Spanish chorizos to disappear due to new Brexit checks, Sunak warned                      No 10 says new £3bn Brexit deal with DUP doesn’t need EU approval                    No 10 has said the agreement struck with the DUP to change post-Brexit checks for Northern Ireland will not need Rishi Sunak to reopen his Windsor Framework deal with the EU. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has claimed the new agreement – which has won the backing of his unionist party – will involve “substantive” changes to trade arrangements. Sir Jeffrey insisted it would remove all post-Brexit checks on goods moving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain under a deal to restore power-sharing at Stormont.                        Adam Forrest reports. No 10 says new £3bn Brexit deal with DUP doesn’t need EU approval                      Roses are red, violets are blue, will there be a shortage from the EU?                    One area of concern has been the possibility that the new checks implemented today could make it more difficult to import flowers, and cause a shortage of red roses for Valentine’s Day. Trade minister Greg Hands played down any potential difficulties last week and said the border target operating model will “simplify border processes for both imports and exports”, . However Labour MP Daniel Zeichner voiced concerns over the difficulties for importing flowers. He told the Commons: “Those five times delayed border checks are coming into effect very soon but those dealing with plant, animal health products are seriously worried about potential delays. “Indeed, the chair of the Horticultural Trade Association pointed out that the process of importing a petunia from the Netherlands has already increased from 19 to 59 steps, and he warns the new border is a disaster waiting to happen. “So what’s the minister doing to ensure that we’ll have a plentiful supply of imported red roses for Valentine’s Day, especially for all those Conservatives on the other side who love each other so much?”                      Labour vows to 'review' Brexit deal in government                    Labour would look again at the trading relationship with the European Union if businesses are “struggling” with new checks that have come into force, a shadow minister has suggested.

Speaking on the morning media round, Ms Leadsom defended the costly brand new system for physical checks at the border, telling Sky News that “businesses are used to the costs of doing business”, and that they might consider “changing their trading arrangemnets with the EU” to bring down costs. Ms Leadsom said: “Leaving the single market was always going to have implications.”                        Zoe Grunewald reports Minister brushes off Brexit checks as ‘price you pay for being sovereign state again’                      Brexit is back                    Good morning, Welcome to our live blog covering the new post-Brexit checks on food and drink imports. From today, health certificates will now be needed on a wide range of EU goods, such as meat, fruit and vegetables. Businesses have already highlighted concerns that these additional checks could cause delays and increased costs. However, ministers have sought to play down possible food shortages at supermarkets and other supply chain problems. Load-Date: February 1, 2024  End of Document
