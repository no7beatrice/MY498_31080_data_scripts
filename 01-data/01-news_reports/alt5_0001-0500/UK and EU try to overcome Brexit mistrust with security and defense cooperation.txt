   UK and EU try to overcome Brexit mistrust with security and defense cooperation CE Noticias Financieras English May 9, 2024 Thursday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC.

Brexit, like Jorge Luis Borges' legendary Aleph, has become the mirror and center of the UK's reality. It is the real cause of an economy weaker than that of the continent, but also the excuse to justify any disenchantment. The elephant in the middle of the political debate that nobody wants to talk about, and the explanation for any defeat. When in early May the London Gielgud Theatre pulled the curtain down on the musical Opening Night two months ahead of schedule, the author of its songs, the American Rufus Wainwright, blamed the failure on the provincialism that, according to him, brought with it the UK's exit from the EU. "There is a lack of imagination and curiosity for change. All the criticism of the play coming out of Europe was unbelievable. Its staging and pacing are very European, and there has been a very corrosive reaction against that," he complained. In day-to-day realpolitik, however, the agreement reached in February 2023 between British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, dubbed the Windsor Framework Agreement, was perhaps the latest chapter in a long series of years during which Brexit was more of a political battle than an actual decision. With the solution agreed for a definitive fit for Northern Ireland in the new era, the mood for further fighting, both in Brussels and London, was deflated. "Brexit was a major crisis, and I would say we are in the phase of overcoming the crisis. The treaties that frame the new relationship are working, the differences that arose over the Irish protocol were overcome thanks to the new Windsor Framework Agreement, and that helped to restore a climate of dialogue and trust," explains Spaniard Pedro Serrano, who has held the post of EU ambassador to the UK since October 2022. Even the name of that rank, that of ambassador, was called into question by the Boris Johnson government, when any anecdote was used in the ongoing war with Brussels. "Sunak was the one who introduced that major change in the tone of the relationship. He was the one who said: 'We are not going to deal with this issue on a confrontational basis, but on a basis of agreement," explains Serrano, who occupies a position as delicate as it is necessary to recompose and pamper a relationship that has been badly damaged for almost a decade. Labor's future All the polls predict, almost with a notarial guarantee, a landslide victory for the Labour Party in the next general elections in the United Kingdom, which are expected to be held next autumn. The great success, many analysts believe, of the leader of the party, Keir Starmer, has been to accept the reality of the Brexit and to get rid of a debate that is toxic for his electoral interests. Many voters of leftist tradition in the so-called red wall of England (north and Midlands) were seduced by the anti-European rhetoric of Boris Johnson in 2019. Starmer wants to win them back. Both he and his likely foreign minister, David Lammy, walk the wire to launch a declaration of love for the EU, albeit without express commitments. "Labour will strive to improve trade and investment relations with Europe, just as it does with India or the United States. Brexit is already a firm reality. A Labour Government will not pursue rejoining the EU, its internal market or its customs union. But there are a host of pragmatic steps that can be taken to rebuild trust and cooperation, and reduce current barriers to trade," Lammy has written in his manifesto for a "realistic progressivism," which he recently published in Foreign Affairs magazine. Labour wants to build bridges from a solid base, such as the growing security and defense cooperation that the UK and the EU have forged, as evidenced in Ukraine. This is the ground on which mutual trust can be rebuilt, to further explore improvements in other fields, such as trade relations. Starmer knows that the current Trade and Cooperation Agreement that avoided a hard Brexit leaves much to be desired, with respect to British interests, and is confident of improving it when the review process that the treaty itself envisages for 2025 opens. "Security and defense policy is the most intergovernmental of the Union's policies, and therefore the least communitarian. For a country like the United Kingdom, which never had a very developed community spirit, it is easier for it to enter into a policy that is purely intergovernmental," explains Josep Borrell, the EU's high representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, passing through London last week. "All this makes the British government less institutionally biased about embarking on this policy. The area of security and defense is certainly a good arena to start building links," he argues. Restoring trust All the players in the Brexit drama agree that, as in couples' therapy, any rapprochement involves rebuilding trust in each other. Sunak managed to move in that direction, but the political tension within the Conservative Party itself at the prospect of defeat at the polls and the threat of skirting international legality in the announced deportations of irregular immigrants to Rwanda have not helped. "I believe that if you show that you are a partner that can be trusted, anything is possible. We're not there yet, though. I am still quite ashamed of the way our country has behaved on the international stage. And even today we are still flouting international law," says Labour MP Stella Creasy, chair of the in-party Labour Movement for Europe. "It is true that there is already a shared agreement on defense, even if it is within the NATO framework. However, whether this cooperation becomes the route to something more will depend on the conversation between the two sides," Creasy warns. Any breakthrough is on hold today, until it becomes clear who will govern the UK in the coming years. Even an issue as attractive to both sides of the channel as restoring some freedom of movement for young people, to work or study, has been flatly rejected by the Sunak government, fearful of stirring up the Eurosceptics in his party again. "There is great interest on the part of many EU member states to have agreements in the field of mobility. The EU is already preparing for a possible negotiation. There is no offer, but the Commission has published a draft negotiating mandate," Ambassador Serrano points out. "Surely it will be taken into account later, because it is an issue that also generates interest in the United Kingdom. It is not, in any case, a return to freedom of movement or a migratory agreement," he qualifies. Any progress, as Serrano clarifies with measured words, must avoid reviving ghosts that are now almost buried.
