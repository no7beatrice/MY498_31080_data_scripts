   How Farage could be helping to kill Brexit; Daily mail COMMENT Mail on Sunday (London) June 4, 2024 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: EDITORIAL; Pg. 18 Length: 241 words Body   ANGRY that immigration is still soaring and the potential of Brexit remains largely untapped, it's understandable Nigel Farage should want to return to frontline politics. But in seeking to take his anger out on the Tories as president of Reform UK and the party's candidate for Clacton, he risks sabotaging his life's work. It was Mr Farage who helped shift the idea of Brexit from the outer fringes of political debate into the mainstream. In 2016, when the country voted to quit the EU, the victory was his as much as anyone's. Because the fruits of that victory have not been harvested, he wants to punish the Tories by plundering their vote on July 4. He should be careful what he wishes for. While he could prevail in Clacton, where the Leave vote was 70 per cent, it's unlikely any other Reform candidates will win. However, what he can do in a significant number of constituencies is split the Conservative vote and allow Labour in. Latest polling already suggests a Starmer landslide. Mr Farage's intervention makes that even more likely. But he could also be helping to sound Brexit's death knell. Sir Keir was a passionate Remainer who campaigned to overturn the referendum result. There are already reports that Labour wants to realign with Brussels. How long before free movement and the customs union are back on the table? Having been such a trailblazer for Brexit, it would be a tragedy if Mr Farage became an unwitting catalyst in its demise. Load-Date: June 4, 2024  End of Document
