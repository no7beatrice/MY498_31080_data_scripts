   Pride in Brexit; Letters to the Editor The Daily Telegraph (London) June 24, 2024 Monday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 15 Length: 242 words Body   SIR - Lord Frost's article (Comment, June 22) on being proud of Brexit should be required reading for all parliamentarians. Recent goings on in Europe have only strengthened my view that Britain made the right decision. I suspect the EU will implode within the next 20 years or so. After that, we can resume the relationships we used to have with individual members. Jim Bell Hereford SIR - Lord Frost is being disingenuous. Both the Brexit and Remain campaigns were wretched and misleading. The Brexit campaign won by a whisker, and it was therefore beholden on all its proponents to deliver the result and claimed benefits so successfully that disappointed Remainers would be brought onboard. They have failed to do so. Complaining about Remain propaganda is a feeble excuse, and it won't wash. I have no doubt that, had Remain won by a whisker, leading to an equally disappointing and divisive outcome, Lord Frost would have delivered as much anti-Remain propaganda as he could muster. Guy de la BédoyÈre Grantham, Lincolnshire SIR - I recently drew blood on a sharp projecting piece of plastic on the top of a soft drink bottle. It appears big manufacturers are following EU regulations that require bottle tops to be tethered, in order to reduce littering (Magazine, June 22). But such tops get in the way of pouring and drinking. Are any British manufacturers willing to take advantage of Brexit freedoms in this case?
