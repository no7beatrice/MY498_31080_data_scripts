   Rule change gives expats chance to punish Tories over Brexit thetimes.co.uk May 31, 2024 Friday 10:05 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 1202 words Byline: Constance Kampfner, Eymet Highlight: Some 3.5 million Britons living overseas are eligible to vote in the general election — and in one French village ‘le B-word’ is never far from their minds Body   The smell of bacon wafts out of an open window and down towards the terrasse where Maria and Chris Horne are nursing a glass of prosecco and a pint of expertly poured Guinness. At a neighbouring café down the street, Martin and Rhianna are sipping on crisp white wine while their two boys tuck into a packet of Jammie Dodgers.  These families are enjoying a balmy Friday afternoon, not in their native Hampshire or Manchester but in Eymet, France’s most British village.  This tranquil 13th-century                     bastide                     in the Dordogne is home to more than 400 UK expats, who account for roughly one in five residents. Many have long since left their homeland behind. Yet thanks to a rule change, even those who have lived here for decades will be able to vote in next month’s UK general election, after Britain scrapped a 15-year time limit on expatriate voters.  Previously, people who left the UK more than 15 years ago lost their right to vote. However, this rule has now been abolished under the Election Act 2022. There is one issue on all of their minds:                     le B-word                    , as the franglais-speaking locals call it. According to researchers, the stereotype of expats all being Conservative voters “belongs to the 1980s”. Instead many Britons abroad, especially those who were not able to vote in the Brexit referendum of 2016, are said to be gearing up to punish the party for the UK’s tumultuous exit from the European Union.  Susan Collard, a senior lecturer in French politics and European studies at the University of Sussex, found that the Conservatives’ share of overseas votes fell by two thirds between the 2015 and 2019 elections, in large part because of Brexit. There was no evidence to suggest that voting intention had reverted since an extra two million people were added to the franchise, a third of whom are estimated to reside on the Continent.  There are now about 3.5 million Britons living overseas who are eligible to vote in this election. Martin and Rhianna, who most recently voted Conservative but would class themselves as swing voters, said there needed “to be a change”.  Rhianna, 42, said the Tories had failed to “own their mistake” on Brexit. “Even in Eymet, people were voting for it. I just thought what are you doing here then? It was infuriating,” she said. Her husband, who works half the year for Shell in the Middle East, said living abroad had given him a fresh political perspective. He admits to grumbling as a younger man about the number of Polish shops springing up around Manchester. Now, when Martin, 56, craves home comforts, he feels his attitude towards foreigners in Britain soften too.  “It’s funny, since we’ve moved here we’re effectively migrants. So you start to see things from the other side,” he said.  Eymet caters to its homesick inhabitants and then some. The                     Britanniques’                     local hero is Jane Patterson, whose English supermarket supplies a steady flow of ketchup, Marmite, bacon and curry sauce to its resident foreigners. Across the road from Taste of Britain is an English-language bookshop, while the village of 2,600 people also has two tearooms, a pop-up chippy and a curry house.  For several months following Britain’s departure from the single market, Patterson struggled to get products into her store at all. Things have somewhat improved since, but her transport costs are double what they were and she now has to import meat and dairy from Ireland instead of the UK.  “You can’t get what you used to and it’s incredibly frustrating,” she said. “Brexit has caused the UK terrific problems, which they admitted to in the first place, but now it’s all been brushed under the carpet. Look at the price rises.”  Patterson, who hails from west London, might still tune in to BBC Radio 2 but has not voted since arriving in Eymet more than 20 years ago. This time, however, she would consider signing up, were a party to seize the mantle on Brexit. “For those of us that live outside of the UK, that’s our main issue,” she said.  Brexit: four years on, have Times readers’ opinions changed? The votes, it would appear, are Labour’s to lose. Yet the perception in this part of southwest France is that Labour is just as eager to ignore Brexit as its rivals.  Chris Horne, 76, is an instinctive Conservative who believes “in business, not unions”, yet he said he would pay closer attention to any party tackling the issue head-on. “The worst thing is the exchange rate,” he said. “It’s a big issue for us because our pensions are being devalued.”  Sitting beside him, his wife sheepishly admits to having voted to leave in 2016. “If I could take it back I would,” Maria, 65, said. “It’s ruined our lives. We didn’t realise how much it would affect things: postage, travel … cheddar cheese is really expensive now.” She too would consider any party promising closer relations with Europe.  The French villagers are generally positive about their British neighbours, who have undoubtedly livened up the area, though they wish certain residents made more of an effort to speak French. “Without the British we’d be back to the stone age,” said Vincent Martinez, who runs a Franco-British café with his Liverpool-born wife, Sara, who added: “But there are people who have been here for 20 years and can just about say ‘bonjour’.”  Recent polling suggests the French are sympathetic to their concerns. Over two-thirds of Britons would like their country to rejoin the EU, a figure eclipsed by the three-quarters of Europeans who agree, according to a survey by Fondapol, a Paris think tank.  Yet how seriously expats are taken back in the UK will partly depend on how many sign up to vote. In 2019 only 200,000 people were registered as overseas voters out of an estimated 1.2 million who were eligible. An extra 100,000 people have  joined the electoral roll  since the new rules came in, in January, 32,000 since Rishi Sunak made his announcement. Many people in Eymet were still unaware of their newly acquired rights, which according to British in Europe, an organisation that supports and represents UK citizens living on the Continent, can be blamed on the fact that “none of the parties are seriously trying to court them”.  “This is a shame but not surprising, given that no British government has ever put much effort into building ties with its diaspora, for all their talk of its soft power,” a spokeswoman said.  Business group says improving relations with EU is a priority One person, however, who is keen to make his voice heard is Neil Williams. The former film industry professional from Salford had just finished registering online when The Times paid him a visit at Cottages de Garrigue, a holiday rental business outside Eymet that he bought with his husband in 2016.  He had not bothered to cast a ballot at the last general election but said he had grown increasingly concerned about how 14 years of Conservative government had affected his family back home.  “The language is getting more dangerous,” Williams said. “Living in France and seeing the anti-French headlines and anti-EU headlines, it’s quite grim and it makes me more grateful to be here every day.”  Load-Date: May 31, 2024  End of Document
