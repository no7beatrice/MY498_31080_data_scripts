   DAILY MAIL COMMENT: How Nigel Farage could be helping to kill Brexit MailOnline June 4, 2024 Tuesday 12:15 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 550 words Byline: Daily Mail Comment Body   Angry that immigration is still soaring and the potential of Brexit remains largely untapped, it's understandable Nigel Farage should want to return to frontline politics. But in seeking to take his anger out on the Tories as president of Reform UK and the party's candidate for Clacton, he risks sabotaging his life's work. It was Mr Farage who helped shift the idea of Brexit from the outer fringes of political debate into the mainstream. In 2016, when the country voted to quit the EU, the victory was his as much as anyone's. Because the fruits of that victory have not been harvested, he wants to punish the Tories by plundering their vote on July 4. He should be careful what he wishes for. While he could prevail in Clacton, where the Leave vote was 70 per cent, it's unlikely any other Reform candidates will win. However, what he can do in a significant number of constituencies is split the Conservative vote and allow Labour in. Latest polling already suggests a Starmer landslide. Mr Farage's intervention makes that even more likely. But he could also be helping to sound Brexit's death knell. Sir Keir was a passionate Remainer who campaigned to overturn the referendum result. There are already reports that Labour wants to realign with Brussels. How long before free movement and the customs union are back on the table? Having been such a trailblazer for Brexit, it would be a tragedy if Mr Farage became an unwitting catalyst in its demise.                      Labour goes nuclear                    Less than five years ago, Sir Keir Starmer and much of his current shadow cabinet tried to propel Jeremy Corbyn to power - a man openly and viscerally opposed to Britain's nuclear deterrent. In 2016 David Lammy, who may soon be foreign secretary, voted against renewing Trident on the grounds that it contradicted his Christian principles. Deputy leader Angela Rayner was among a clutch of other frontbenchers who voted the same way, and said yesterday she hasn't changed her mind since. So, what are we to make of the party's support for nuclear weapons now? On the campaign trail yesterday, Sir Keir said they were 'a fundamental part of our defence' - and that he'd be prepared to use them. He has performed so many U-turns since becoming leader, it's hard to keep up. But this one really matters. As he himself said, national security is the most important issue of all to the country. Would our nuclear arsenal be safe in his hands? He claims it would, adding ominously that the shadow cabinet are 'right behind him'. Given their previous commitment to disarmament, that is perhaps what should worry us most.                      Crisis of identity                    The Tory pledge to defend the safety and dignity of women and girls by enshrining biological sex in law is a welcome outbreak of common sense. Toughening up the Equality Act would prevent trans women - born male - taking legal action against being barred from female changing rooms, jails, and sports. For years trans extremists have been allowed to plant the insidious notion that anyone can choose their own gender. The only mystery is why it took so long for the Government to stand up to them. Labour dismisses this foray into gender politics as a 'distraction'. They're wrong. It is of concern to millions of ordinary people. Load-Date: June 4, 2024  End of Document
