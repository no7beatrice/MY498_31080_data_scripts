   'Broken Britain': the country where "nothing works" is about to say goodbye to 14 years of Conservative rule CE Noticias Financieras English June 29, 2024 Saturday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC.

It is the weekend in June that this town of about 100,000 in central England celebrates the festival in honor of its most celebrated fellow citizen, but the corner of its pedestal is still broken and littered with cigarette butts. Brexitland: the bleak life in the United Kingdom outside the European Union.          The festival is in danger after its public budget was cut and volunteers ask for donations with a cap on the door of the town hall. Worcester has not gone bankrupt, like neighboring Birmingham, but its public accounts are tight, as are those of most councils hit by 14 years of public spending cuts by the national government, on which almost everything in England depends. A few days ago another piece of a medieval bridge that had partially collapsed five months earlier collapsed.          Worcester still attracts tourists thanks to its cathedral, where King John of England, known as "John Landless" and Robin Hood's bad guy, is buried, and who also accepted the Magna Carta of 1215, the pioneering text that accepted that the king was not above the law. On the high street, there is still an independent bookshop among chain burger joints, charity stores and betting stores, and a new market is about to open. The town has a university campus and just outside is the Perrins sauce factory.          Worcester is halfway down the Government's league table of England's "most deprived" areas. But child poverty has never been higher since these data began to be recorded in 2014: more than 22% of children live in a family whose income is 60% below the median. More than 200 public schools in the area already know that they will suffer further cuts and will have 168 pounds (about 200 euros) less per pupil next academic year. At least they did not have to close at the beginning of the school year because of the danger of collapse like several in Birmingham.          The train station on the outskirts has a gleaming wooden roof and clean appearance because it opened in 2020 in a rare investment boast outside London. But, since March, more than seven out of ten trains have been late or cancelled. The two private companies that control the route blame strikes and flooding, which wreck homes and stores every few days.          When it rains, the water company, a monopoly that privately manages all infrastructure, supply and waste, dumps into the river. Last year alone, there were 248 sewage discharges in Worcester, according to Top of the Poops, a website that tracks, as the name implies, the crap that hits the water. In February, the environment agency fined the company, Severn Trent Water, £2 million for irresponsible pollution in another river in the region.          Spills are a particularly pronounced public health problem in a country where swimming in open water is part of the national culture. Every year, thousands of people are hospitalized for waterborne illnesses; the number has grown by 60% since 2010.          The way the entire water management chain was privatized during Margaret Thatcher's government explains part of what is happening.       "The Worcester woman"          On July 4, Worcester, where the Conservatives have been winning the general election for 14 years, is expected to vote overwhelmingly for Keir Starmer's Labour Party. In this area of the West Midlands, the party that has been in government since 1979 has always won. In the 2016 referendum, almost 54% supported Brexit.          In the 1997 election, the Labour Party started talking about "the Worcester woman" as the prototype of the key voter who had supported the Conservative Party and was willing to back Tony Blair's New Labour: a woman in her 30s and 40s, concerned about the cost of living, the health service and education. Until then, this prototypical voter had been voting Conservative for almost a century.          The profile is still relevant now because "the crisis of life, the national health service, schools and child care are central to this election," Anna Muggeridge, professor of history at the University of Worcester and an expert in gender studies, explains to elDiario.es. "In 1997, these day-to-day issues were recognized as issues affecting the 'Worcester woman,' although obviously men are equally affected. But historically these are also the areas with which parties have tried to appeal to women voters in particular."          Muggeridge recounts that during the 1920s and 1930s the parties used the rhetoric that housewives were "the home economics ministers." The paradox, she stresses, is that there has never been a female finance minister in the UK. Rachel Reeves, Labour's economics spokeswoman, could be the first.          We speak on the day Starmer visits Muggeridge College to give a speech on the National Health Service. The "Worcester women" she meets are students and paramedics who are already overwhelmed by the waiting lists piling up and the lack of resources when they do internships.          Starmer promises them in the Q&A session that more overtime pay will be offered and assures them that the time spent on call will be monitored so that practitioners don't burn out. Some of them seem satisfied with the response and the time given to them by what is expected to be the next prime minister.          "It's good that they are recognizing us and trying to do something to keep us in the national health service," Amee Grimstead tells the BBC afterwards. Another fellow student is grateful for Starmer's good intentions, but has doubts about a radical change in her daily life: "He says all the right things and that's reassuring, but there's a lack of facts about what's actually going to happen," comments Katherine Pingree, also a student and who stood in the local elections in May for the Green Party.          Waiting lists in the face of an overburdened national health service are one of the reasons that will cost the Conservative Party a historic defeat, according to the polls. The state of healthcare is the main concern for more than 40% of citizens, according to the Ipsos pollster's index. At the end of April, waiting lists accumulated 7.57 million pending interventions in England.       "Failed state".          Nothing in Worcester is particularly bad or different from the rest of the country, with the exception of London, whose wealth is maintained by the effect of financial services and the attraction of workers and investment.          In fact, London is the only area in England and Wales that has continued to grow in every quarter since the pandemic recession in 2020; even neighboring areas, such as the South East, have fallen into recession. If London were excluded, the UK would be poorer than Mississippi, the poorest state in the US, and much of Europe. Although an imbalance between the largest and most productive cities and the rest is common in all countries, the difference is not so pronounced in other countries, as the Financial Times explains by giving the example of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Munich in Austria or even San Francisco in California.          This year, an average Slovenian household will have more money at its disposal than an average British household, according to the same newspaper's data analysis. The poorest people in the UK are already poorer than the poorest people in 14 European countries. The UK, in fact, has become one of the most unequal countries in the world. This trend did not start in 2010, but has been exacerbated in recent years. In 2022, the number of private jet flights in the country broke a record in Europe and increased by 75% over the previous year, according to Dutch environmental consultancy CE Delf.          I ask Sam Freedman, a policy and education expert who worked in government at the beginning of David Cameron's first term, what has changed in 14 years of Conservative governments and he says: "The UK is much poorer as a country and also relative to others, such as the United States, but also France and Germany. The quality of services you get is much worse. Our health service has never been worse."          Freedman is the author of a successful newsletter on politics that he writes half with his historian father, and of a book on the UK's systemic problems, from his experience also from the inside, which will be published in a few days and is titled Failed State. "The UK is not a failed state in the way Somalia or Syria failed; it is a failed state in the sense that the institutions that used to work no longer work. People who live here feel that things have gotten much worse," he explains.          Some problems are rooted in mistakes that predate recent Conservative governments, such as the kind of privatizations Thatcher did in the 1980s, which often allowed private oligopolies, with little competition, public subsidies and controls that have been weakening, as the crisis over water quality and the accountability of the companies that manage it now shows. The problem, Freedman recalls, is that now the new Labor government will not have the money to nationalize some of these services unless forced to do so after a bankruptcy.          At the same time, Freedman explains, it is more difficult to obtain planning permission in the UK than in other European countries and there is little investment in infrastructure and new construction, which explains the decrepit state of rails, pipelines and roads. One of the Labour Party's election pledges is to fill a million potholes every year.          Local authorities have hardly any powers or resources of their own to attend to the most basic tasks and are dependent on the decisions of each new government.          "We have always been fairly centralized... Things started to get much worse under the Thatcher Government, with a deliberate destruction of local government. Although the Blair Government was more effective in some respects, it also exacerbated this trend and spurned scrutiny. The current government has simply doubled down on this and made it even worse," he explains.          Looking back, since 2010, each government has fared a little worse than the previous one. "It's very hard to find things that have gone well... In the last eight years since the Brexit referendum and actually for the full 14 years, there have been very few success stories," says Freedman. Making an effort, he points to two major positives: school results are better and the UK has increased its installation and consumption of renewable energy, not least thanks to the gambles of David Cameron and Boris Johnson.       Worthing woman           The state of the health serviceThe NHS, traditionally among the country's proudest symbols, is now a continuing source of complaint. It's what is most often heard among voters, for example in several focus groups organized by More in Common, a pollster and project to promote conversation that does some of these streaming interviews and in which I have participated as an observer in recent weeks.          Rather than "the Worcester woman," who the Conservatives already write off after defeats in the area in May's local elections, More in Common believes that the future of the Conservative Party will be decided by older women and in traditionally more conservative places, such as Worthing, a southern coastal town that is more affluent than Worcester but has also suffered from rising costs of basic goods, loss of community life, decrepit infrastructure and lack of access to health services.          One evening in June the pollster gathers nine women of the profile she believes is key to determining whether or not the Tories sink or not: women over 55, homeowners, who do not have a college degree and live in Worthing.          In conversation, several complain about the impossibility of getting a doctor's appointment or lack of resources, and repeat the phrase heard in every conversation: "Broken Britain", the United Kingdom that is broken, that does not work.          "Politicians told so many lies with Brexit about how much better off the NHS was going to be because of it," complained Lynne, a part-time worker at the local university.          "Everyone focuses on the NHS all the time. But I think everything is broken, nothing is working. The police, the schools, everywhere you look... Everything seems to be falling apart. They call it Broken Britain," says Nina, a waitress in a downtown cafe and a sales clerk in a perfume shop, as the others nod. "And everything is so expensive..."          Inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022, and although it has now dropped to 2%, food prices are 20% more expensive than they were in July 2021. Many families are still recovering from the shock of the last two years' electricity bills and mortgage payments (Bank of England interest rates are still at 5.25% versus 4.25 from the European Central Bank). The complaints of these women reflect unease about the future, but also about what they see around them, with more and more cardboard on the street as makeshift beds. Nearly 4,000 people are sleeping rough in England, according to the latest government figures, which is twice as many as in 2010, when the Conservatives came to power in the midst of the financial crisis. Charities have cared for more people than ever before in food banks.          Daily life has worsened even for people with good salaries and homes of their own. "I was a school principal and last winter I couldn't put the heating on... I had a good salary, but I was afraid I couldn't afford the electricity bill and meet my mortgage payments. A lot of middle-class people are afraid now," Catherine D., a now-retired teacher who is now helping her daughter with her grandchildren, told the group. Catherine was sure she would not vote Conservative again.          "Everything is broken, even our political structure," said Catherine J., a data analyst who was thinking about not voting.       Brexit and betrayal          Some of these trends were already emerging when 52% of voters supported Brexit in June 2016. Indeed, some studies note a correlation between public spending cuts, which began in 2010 as soon as David Cameron came to power, and the referendum result. The areas hit hardest by cuts coincide with the places where anti-European discourse took hold the most, according to the study by Thiemo Fetzer, a professor of economics at the University of Warwick. "The findings suggest that the EU referendum could have resulted in a victory for the Remain vote had it not been for austerity," he writes.          Chancellor of the Exchequer in 2010, George Osborne, introduced the word "austerity" into the vocabulary as a positive, a World War II-like call for restraint and in contrast to the perceived eurozone and spending excesses of the previous government of Labour's Gordon Brown. The UK went further than most of its neighbors until Johnson came to power in 2019 with a new pro-spending message.          Ben Ansell, a political scientist at Oxford University, cuts a finer line and finds a pattern between house prices and support for Brexit: the more house values had fallen in an area, the more support the idea of leaving the European Union garnered. Property values are one way of understanding territorial inequality, especially between London and its environs and the rest of the country. But Brexit created new divisions that did not match the traditional way of looking at Conservative and Labour voters.          "The Brexit crossed over, and a lot of our traditional divisions in the country confused our whole politics," Ansell explains to elDiario.es. "In a funny way, that actually made us less polarized in the way we used to be polarized: north versus south, rich versus poor, high versus low education.... And we became polarized around this new cultural dimension."          What remains of Brexit, beyond the economic and social damage, is now "a sense of betrayal," according to Sam Freedman, the author of Failed State. For one part of the country, he explains, "a government deliberately did something that impoverished the country, made it worse or made it less connected to the world." For the other part, it hasn't gone much better: "People who voted for Brexit because they thought it would make the country better also feel betrayed because it didn't."
