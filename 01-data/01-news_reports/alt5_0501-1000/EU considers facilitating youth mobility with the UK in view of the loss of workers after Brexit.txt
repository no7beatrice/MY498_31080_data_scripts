   EU considers facilitating youth mobility with the UK in view of the loss of workers after Brexit CE Noticias Financieras English April 19, 2024 Friday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC.

The European Commission has proposed to the 27 to eliminate obstacles to the mobility of the young population, which has led the United Kingdom to lose an important labor mass that it was trying to recover bilaterally with some states. The idea that the EU government has proposed to the member states is that young people between 18 and 30 years of age can move for periods of four years to study or work without the need to establish a prior criterion. Spain and the United Kingdom note "significant progress" in the final stretch of the negotiation on Gibraltar.          "The UK's withdrawal from the EU has resulted in a decrease in mobility between the EU and the UK. This situation has particularly affected opportunities for young people to experience life across the Channel and to benefit from youth, cultural, educational, research and training exchanges," the European Commission said in a statement. Following Brexit, free movement between the EU and the UK disappeared and mobility is governed by the immigration rules of each party.          The European Commission needs the go-ahead from the Council - where the governments of the 27 are represented - to start negotiations with the UK with the aim of addressing "in an innovative way the main barriers to mobility that young people experience today and creating a right for young people to travel from the EU to the UK and vice versa more easily and for a longer period of time."          The conditions for that sort of free movement for young people would have to be negotiated (age, length of stay, eligibility conditions and rules for verifying compliance), but the intention is that travel would not have to be purposeful or subject to quotas and that beneficiaries could study, work or travel.          The European Commission's move also seeks to prevent the UK from entering into bilateral agreements with some member states causing a split in the EU. The British government had, in fact, begun some negotiations of this type in view of the loss of young European labor in many sectors. The Mayor of London, the Labour Party's Saqid Khan, called for a special mechanism to facilitate travel and jobs for Europeans under 35 years of age to be applied in his city, one of the places most affected by the loss of students and workers from the EU.          Another pending issue is the paperwork for the recognition of work and residence rights in the UK for tens of thousands of Europeans who were in the country before Brexit took effect.  As of September 30, 2023, there were still some 140,000 applications to be reviewed, including those of more than 5,700 Spaniards.          After Brexit, the EU and the UK have been ironing out differences and reaching collaboration agreements, for example for participation in the Horizon Europe program, which will allow British researchers to participate under the same conditions as other partners. Important pending issues have also been closed, such as the Windsor agreement on trade in Northern Ireland, and important progress has also been made on the future relationship with Gibraltar, which Spain and the UK hope will be sealed in the coming weeks.
