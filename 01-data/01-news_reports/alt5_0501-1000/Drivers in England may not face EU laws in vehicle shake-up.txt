   Drivers in England may not face EU laws in vehicle shake-up birminghammail.co.uk May 25, 2024 Saturday 5:56 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: MOTORING NEWS; Version:1 Length: 385 words Byline: By, James Rodger Highlight: Transport Secretary Mark Harper said the UK can "rethink" the regulation of the cars and vehicles on Britain's roads in the wake of the Brexit vote and European Union referendum Body   The UK is considering scrapping a range of EU driving regulations, with Transport Secretary Mark Harper suggesting a post-Brexit overhaul. Harper highlighted the opportunity to "rethink" vehicle regulation now that Britain has parted ways with the EU. Since Brexit, the average Briton is nearly £2,000 worse off, research in 2023 found, while there are nearly two million fewer jobs overall in the UK. There has also been a change in the laws, with the Brexit Freedoms Bill introduced. Now, there is a plan to shake up rules of the road. Mr Harper said: "Now that the UK has left the EU, we can rethink vehicle regulation. We have the freedom to create a system that meets the needs of manufacturers and consumers in the UK. But that doesn't mean we will cast aside the things that already work well." He further explained: "Type approval provides necessary regulatory certainty to manufacturers and ensures UK citizens can be confident that new vehicles are safe and environmentally sound and that enforcement action will be taken where non-compliances are found."

These include aligning with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's standardisation framework, adopting a more adaptable stance on recognising international standards and testing, and the possibility of crafting unique domestic requirements or processes to benefit Great Britain.  The initial proposal focuses on the regulations that govern a significant portion of the passenger vehicle criteria within the GB type approval scheme. The Department for Transport has pledged to work closely with the DVSA to finalise a plan that will be implemented later this year. As Mr Harper declared, "We've already made progress and established the foundations to develop our approach to vehicle regulation. A full GB type approval scheme entered into force in January 2023 to provide continuity and minimise cost."  Furthermore, the transport secretary and Conservative Party Member of Parliament went on to say, "This will eventually replace the existing provisional scheme that has been in place since Brexit, beginning with new models brought to market in February 2024."
