   How would Sunak cut civil servants to fund defence spending? Liverpool Echo April 27, 2024 Saturday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 16 Length: 233 words Body   RISHI Sunak plans to axe 70,000 civil servants to pay for a hike in defence spending. He said defence would receive an additional £75bn over six years. To give some perspective on that figure, the difference between one million and one billion is that one million seconds is 11.5 days and one billion seconds is 31.5 YEARS. That's an awful lot of money we're talking about! The number of civil servants spiked from mid-2020 and there are currently around 119,000 more officials than in mid-2016. Some of this further increase will have been due to the Covid pandemic but most will now be required by Brexit. Brexit seems to have required the recruitment of approaching 100,000 officials - a great deal more than the 60,000 employed by 'Brussels' to carry out all centralised EU functions. Assuming a cost per head of £50k, Brexit appears to cost approaching £5 billion pa in staff costs alone (see 'Understanding the Civil Service',' https://www.civilservant.org.uk). This is a hidden cost of Brexit that never gets a mention. It also gives lie to the claim that the EU is a colossal bureaucratic waste when we are employing more staff than the EU in order to "get Brexit done". Just think of how much could be done with the money saved on civil service salaries alone. It's enough to make you weep when you consider all that Brexit has cost us, and I'm not just talking in monetary terms.
