   10 ways travel for Brits has worsened post-Brexit from new visa rules to longer queues mirror.co.uk January 24, 2024 Wednesday 2:05 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: EUROPE; Version:1 Length: 1739 words Byline: By, Milo Boyd Highlight: Since the UK left the EU on January 1, 2024, the country has departed from the bloc and its member states in a number of different ways when it comes to air, rail and sea travel Body   Brits are paying more to wait longer and receive a worse service when it comes to travel post-Brexit, experts have said.  Almost exactly four years since the UK left the EU, the long trailered "Brexit dividends" are not completely obvious for everybody to see. For those who enjoy travelling, whether by rail, air or sea, leaving the bloc has made things worse in almost all cases.  Whether due to legislation, not linking up systems with previous partners in the EU, or a divergence in areas of investment, Brits are arguably suffering from a slower, more expensive and less-green system than our European neighbours.  That's not even counting All the new travel rules for 2024 from 100ml liquid rule changes to new tourist taxes which UK holidaymakers will need to take into account when planning holidays either.  We take a look at 10 ways Brexit has impacted the way Brits can travel -check them out below.

It takes longer to leave the country                    The UK Government has admitted that new checks officials at Dover must now make following Brexit were at least partly at fault for the long queues that now build up at the port at peak times. Some coaches have been stuck for ten hours waiting for cross Channel ferries in recent summers.  Last year Sunak's official spokesperson said the delays were due to "a combination of factors", including poor weather and the high volume of traffic. They also admitted that the fact French officials now manually inspect and stamp every passport as passengers left the UK was adding time to the process.                      2. Longer queues at airports                    British passport holders now face longer queues at airports in EU member states, mixed in with travellers from other non-bloc states and are often stopped from using automatic passport gates. This has caused lengthy delays at airports which see a high number of British passengers, such as Malaga in Spain.                       3. UK can't catch up with EU highspeed rail                    One divergence in direction between the UK and EU travel is high-speed rail, according to Jon Worth, a rail expert who runs Trains for Europe. While the UK Government has scrapped a large part of the already hugely delayed HS2 project, many EU countries are forging ahead with interlinked highspeed rail systems.  "There's a highspeed line between France and Spain funded by EU money. The focus at the moment is about getting the network in place, and upgrading infrastructure," Jon said.  "Spain is persuing big investments in high speed rail and building new lines, Portugal is investing between Lisbon and Porto, Czechia is investigating its first highspeed line, so is Poland. A line is being built between Lyon in France and Turin in Italy. Rail Baltica is being built. That commitment in daytime rail infrastructure is continuing in the EU. The UK has said it's all too expensive to do."                      4. No free or very low cost train travel                    While the UK Government is free to subsidise train travel as much as it likes, British passengers pay more and more each year. Train ticket will increase 4.9% this year -a rate higher than inflation.  At the same time EU train passengers are benefitting from a post-lockdown movement of heavily subsidised train travel which seems to be sweeping across the bloc.  "It is starting a debate in the EU -Could we have a low price German ticket that works in France" Jon said. "The Austrians started it with their Klimaticket, (EURO)1000 for a year and you can use the entire public transport everywhere in the country. That helped inspire Germany's one which is cheaper but doesn't apply to intercity trains, then that inspired trains in Spain and Portugal.  "It's very much countries learning from each other. It is a commitment to low cost public transport everyone can use in European countries." Some countries have gone further. Luxemburg has made all its public transport free, as has Montpelier in France and Tallinn in Estonia.                       5. Eurostar tickets are more expensive and harder to get                    It has become harder and more expensive to get on a Eurostar train since Brexit. Former Eurostar CEO Jacques Damas said that peak capacity at both London St Pancras and Paris Gare du Nord was 30% less than it was pre-Brexit, because of the increased infrastructure needed to check and stamp the passports of travellers, The Local reported. Had Eurostar not limited capacity on its trains leaving the UK, there would be long queues similar to those seen at Dover snaking through central London, he warned. Fewer seats and the same amount of demand sounds like a great recipe for higher prices.  Jon Worth concluded: "The UK doesn't want to solve the passport problem because of Brexit. It won't be solved in 2024. It is an absolute sodding nightmare at the moment."                      6. UK lags behind in the race for green air fuel                     The EU is forging ahead with cleaner, greener forms of air travel, while the UK is lagging behind, according to Matt Finch, policy manager at Transport and Environment.  The transport expert criticised the UK for not having a sustainable aviation fuel SAF mandate enshrined in law as the EU does, meaning airlines in member states have a big incentive to adopt the cleaner fuel-type while UK ones don't. In the next couple of years the EU is stopping airlines receiving free pollution permits for all flights to and from the bloc globally, while the UK is stopping just those flying domestically or to the EU.  The tax-free status of kerosene the most common type of jet fuel may soon be phased out by the EU if tabled legislation is passed, giving aviation firms massive incentive to master green tech. The UK has signalled that it has no plans to start taxing kerosene and even cut domestic air passenger duty last year -the closest thing we have to a jet fuel tax. "The EU policy is designed to push airlines to decarbonise their operations. The base price of SAF is more expensive than fossil kerosene. Airlines are not voluntarily buying SAF, so by applying fuel duty to fossil fuel, this makes sustainable fuel a lot more attractive," Matt explained.                      7. End of hassle-free long holidays and Interrailing                     Before Brexit, Brits could stay as long as they liked in the EU, now a '90 day rule' is in place. For trips to the Schengen area -covering most EU nations plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and several micro-states -British passport holders can stay a maximum of 90 days in any 180. That has made very long holidays and trips around the Continent on the likes of Interrail trickier for those with a dark blue passport in His Majesty's name. If you're found to breach the rules, you could be slapped with a one-year entry ban.                      8. No more visa free travel                    From Spring 2025, the new European Travel Information and Authorisation System ETIAS scheme will launch. Brits will have to register online and pay a fee in advice to get permission to visit the EU bloc, whereas EU residents won't. It will cost (EURO)7 and have to be renewed every three years. Travellers will need to scan their passports or other travel document at a self-service kiosk each time they cross an EU border, with a new up-to-date system keeping track of them.                      9. Stricter passport rules                    Before Brexit, a passport wasn't required for Brits to travel to and from the bloc -any type of ID would do. Now a passport is required, and it must meet "third country" visitor requirements. One such requirement is that it must be valid for at least three months after the date you intend to leave the EU country you are visiting.  Over the past two years many Brits have been caught out by this rule and been stopped from travelling, particularly as the 'valid until' date can be earlier than the stated expiry date on the passport.                      10. Weaker passports                    Since the British public voted to leave the European Union in 2016 the country's travel documents have had a serious fall in fortunes. While they may be a rich, patriotic blue following Brexit, they are of less practical use. Now the British passport sits in 22nd place in the Passport Index by Arton Capital, which looks at how many nations people from a given country can visit with and without visas. The UK passport gives access to 126 visa-free, 49 with a visa on arrival and 26 with a visa acquired before travel. Many EU countries now sit above the UK in the rankings, including Poland in 14th place. Back in 2014 the UK sat third in the table.                      It's not all bad though...                     There are some areas where the UK is arguably doing better than the EU when it comes to travel following Brexit. For example, domestic flying is cheaper. From an environmental perspective, halving APD is a terrible idea and it encourages more domestic routes when greener train transport is already in place. From a 'cost to the customer' perspective, it can be seen as a benefit. Meanwhile, the UK has forged ahead with zero-emission planes. According to Matt Finch from Transport and Environment, the UK Government has made great strides forward when it comes to investing in zero-emission hydrogen planes -a potential means of flying of the future. "A lot of people think SAF is a distraction, and zero emission aircraft powered by hydrogen are the answer. We are doing more than the EU, but we were always able to do more than EU. Any other EU member state could do the same thing," Matt said. "It is looking like France and the UK will be the big players." Finally, post-Brexit Brits can now do both duty free and tax free shopping in the EU. When you purchase something duty free, it means that the retailer did not add any local taxes to the price. Being able to buy tax-free goods is not something Brits could do in EU airports pre-Brexit.
