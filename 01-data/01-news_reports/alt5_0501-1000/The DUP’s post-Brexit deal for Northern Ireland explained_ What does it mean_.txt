   The DUP’s post-Brexit deal for Northern Ireland explained: What does it mean? telegraph.co.uk January 30, 2024 Tuesday 3:20 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:2 Length: 1438 words Byline: By James Crisp, Europe Editor Highlight: Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says DUP is to end its two-year boycott of Stormont over post-Brexit trade agreement that paralysed Northern Ireland Body   Sir Jeffrey Donaldson  has announced the DUP will end its two-year boycott of Stormont over post-Brexit trading arrangements. What has Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, offered the DUP leader to convince him to return to power-sharing and what does it mean for Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole? Here is everything you need to knowabout the Irish Sea border , Brexit, a row that has paralysed Northern Ireland and what happens next.                      What has happened?                    The DUP has overcome internal divisions  to back an offer from the UK Government over the Irish Sea border. This should bring an end to the DUP’s boycott of the Northern Ireland Assembly, which has lasted almost two years, and return a devolved government to the region.                      What is the Irish Sea border?                    The land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland became invisible as border infrastructure was removed after the Good Friday Agreement 25 years ago. Brexit risked the return of checks  because the UK left the EU, while Ireland remained a member state. The DUP campaigned for Leave but most people in Northern Ireland voted Remain. The UK and EU agreed to prevent a hard land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after Brexit to prevent inflaming Troubles-era tensions. Northern Ireland continued to follow hundreds of Brussels’s rules  – and was subject to the European Court of Justice in some matters – as part of a deal that gives it unique dual access to the UK and EU markets. The Northern Ireland Protocol introduced checks in the Irish Sea on British goods and animals entering the region to ensure they met EU standards, in case they crossed into the Republic. It came into force on Jan 1 2021.                      That sounds controversial…                    It was. The Government threatened to tear up the Protocol because it was damaging trade with Northern Ireland. That threat pushed the UK and EU to the brink of a trade war, which heavy focus on whether British sausages could still be sent to the region. The DUP walked out of power-sharing in Stormont in protest against the post-Brexit trading arrangements, which it argued put Northern Ireland’s place in the UK at risk, in February 2022. In February 2023, Rishi Sunak agreed the Windsor Framework with the EU,  which reduced the number of checks and introduced a less stringent “green lane” for goods that were meant to stay in Northern Ireland. However, the Windsor Framework was not good enough  for the DUP. Its leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, entered negotiations with the Government to end the Stormont boycott, which resulted in Tuesday morning’s announcement.                      What’s in the deal?                    The full detail has not yet been made public.  However, it involves a £3.3 billion finance package for Stormont, and Westminster legislation to guarantee Northern Ireland’s place in the UK. It also includes a new east-west council to bolster intra-UK trade ties. The Telegraph has revealed that the Government offered to rebrand the “green lane” as the “UK Internal Market Lane” and to screen any new laws so they do not create barriers to trade. The Government insists this will not damage its ability to diverge from EU rules, after Brexiteers raised fears the screening commitment would sacrifice hard-won Brexit freedoms. The Government has also promised to discuss further reductions in border checks with the EU in the future. But, and perhaps crucially, the Irish Sea border remains in place, as well its checks, and the deal is not a renegotiation of the Windsor Framework with Brussels.                      What does the EU say about all this?                    The European Commission said it was not party to the negotiations but was pleased that a devolved government could be restored. It added that it expected the UK to uphold the Windsor Framework deal.                      How were the DUP able to boycott Stormont?                    A majority of Northern Ireland’s political parties support the Irish Sea border but that did not prevent the DUP, which campaigned for Brexit , from mothballing Stormont. The Northern Ireland Assembly, a cornerstone of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement, is run on a mandatory power-sharing coalition between the largest unionist party and largest nationalist party. The DUP lost its status as the region’s dominant political force toSinn Fein for the first time in May 2022 ’s Assembly elections but remained the largest unionist party and entitled to form half of the coalition. Fresh Assembly elections would not have broken the deadlock as polls showed the DUP would have remained the largest unionist party, not least because many of its voters support its tough stance on the Irish Sea border. Sinn Fein is understood to have seen the deal for the DUP, but other political parties have not yet, which has led to accusations of acarve up between the largest unionist and nationalist parties.                      Has the lack of devolved government hurt Northern Ireland?                    It certainly prevented necessary action on NHS waiting lists, the longest in the UK, and the cost of living crisis in the UK’s poorest region. In January, Northern Ireland endured its biggest public sector strike in 50 years, with up to 170,000 workers downing tools, which could have been avoided if the Assembly was sitting. The financial package includes money to settle the pay claim. The boycott has also damaged trust in politicians, who are regularly accused of drawing salaries without doing any work. Westminster imposed painful budget cuts on Northern Ireland in the absence of a devolved government. The lengthy deadlock has coincided with increased discussion over a referendum on Irish reunification, an issue given fresh impetus by Brexit.                      What happens next?                    The DUP’s support is conditional on the Government bringing forward the promised legislation, which is expected imminently. The deal should be published on Wednesday and the legislation passed in Westminster on Thursday. The Northern Ireland Assembly could be recalled on Friday or Saturday to elect a new speaker. The next step will be the nomination of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. The two roles have equal weight, but different titles, and neither can act without the support of the other. Sinn Fein is entitled to nominate the First Minister for the first time in Northern Ireland’s history and that will be Michelle O’Neill. The DUP will nominate a Deputy First Minister but has not said who that will be. Sir Jeffrey remained as an MP in Westminster while the boycott continued, despite winning a seat in the Assembly elections, so it could be his ally Emma Little-Pengelly instead. Ministers for the other nine Stormont departments are distributed around Northern Ireland’s political parties, using the d’Hondt mechanism.                      What does the Government say?                    Rishi Sunak told the Cabinet it was a positive step. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, said it would safeguard the region’s place in the Union and improve its public services and finances.                      Is Brexit finally done in Northern Ireland?                    Not quite. Hardline unionists and loyalists have vowed to fight the deal “every single day” and the DUP is clearly deeply divided over the issue. While the party’s Assembly members wanted to end the boycott, its Westminster MPs were understood to be against accepting the deal. The agreement could still fall apart unless the parties move quickly. Tory Brexiteer backbenchers in London may not be convinced that the deal does not sacrifice Brexit freedoms, despite the Government’s insistence it provides no legal barrier to divergence. The UK and EU will continue to meet regularly to discuss the post-Brexit trading arrangements. There is a consent vote on the Irish Sea border, which must take place before the end of this year. That vote should pass but part of the Government’s offer to the DUP is the offer of an independent report if it does not have majority unionist support. That report on Northern Ireland’s constitutional status must be finished within seven months of the vote and the Government has promised to respond to it and discuss its findings with the EU. Labour has promised to negotiate a veterinary agreement with Brussels, which would reduce UK-EU border checks, as well as checks between GB and NI, if it forms the next government. However, Brussels will demand greater alignment with EU rules for that deal. Load-Date: January 30, 2024  End of Document
