   I’m a Celeb 2023: Nella takes on terrifying bushtucker trial after Farage and Sirieix butt heads over Brexit The Independent (United Kingdom) November 20, 2023 Monday 10:17 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS,TV & RADIO,CULTURE; Version:16 Length: 5453 words Byline: Ellie Muir Highlight: Things got political between campmates Nigel Farage and First Dates’ Fred on I’m A Celebrity... Body   The return of I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! is upon us. The reality series returned to screens on Sunday night (19 November), with the second episode of the 2023 season bringing political drama and emotional upheaval. Viewers are getting to know the new crop of celebrities decamping to the Australian outback in the hopes of being crowned this year’s King or Queen of the Jungle.  All eyes will undoubtedly be on former Ukip and Brexit party MEP Nigel Farage  who, following in the footsteps of disgraced politician Matt Hancock  last year, is among the stars who have entered the jungle. The controversial politician is joined by This Morning’s Josie Gibson , Jamie Lynn Spears , and YouTuber Nella Rose. You can find the full line-up of 2023 campmates here.  It is no surprise that the politician-turned-GB News presenter was voted by the public to take part in the first disgusting eating trial of the series. Last night, he was served a “Margar-teat-a” – a pizza topped with a camel udder, a sheep udder and the teat of cow served on a layer of creamy cheese.  He ate another pizza with four types of animal penis and a pig’s anus.  Meanwhile, Jamie Lynn Spears opened up about her last conversation with her sister Britney Spears before she left for the jungle, stating that “every family fights” but she and her sister “love each other”. It was only inevitable that political debate reared its head in the series, and it was kicked off by First Dates star Fred Sirieix, who told Farage that his pro-Brexit campaign as the leader of the Ukip party was “shameful”.  On tonight’s episode, YouTube star Nella Rose will face the next Bushtucker Trial named “No Time to Cry” after the public voted for her. She will be sent on a secret mission to find stars in an underground lair.                      I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! airs Sunday to Friday at 9pm and Saturday at 9.30pm on ITV.

In the run up to the general election in 2010, Farage was involved in a plane crash, and suffered a punctured lung, two chipped vertebrae, several fractured ribs and a fractured sternum. Josie asked: “What were you doing at the time when you were flying a plane, where were you going?” Nigel admitted: “Being an idiot, flying a banner.” Fred asked: “What was on the banner?” Nigel replied: “A Brexit message, obviously…” Fred asked: “What was the message?” “Vote for independence or something like that,” Nigel said.

I’d always said to the boys, ‘I really like her, I think she’s hot’.’” “We went to a nightclub in Ireland after doing a show together one night and we were just chatting, getting on really well. She went to the toilet, right? She left her handbag at the table with me. So then, I thought, right, got her phone out and called myself so I had her phone number. It took about three months of pestering her to get a date.” He said that their first date was at McDonald’s car park in Wembley. ”Three and a bit years later, three kids… I’m very, very lucky.”                      Sam Thompson admits he took Zara McDermott on first date to Sticks’n’Sushi                    The pair met after Love Island star Zara McDermott slid into the Made in Chelsea star’s DMs...

The electric shocks, confined space and the bugs meant Nella found the challenge very difficult. So she decided to give in and exit the challenge early by screaming the first “I’m A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!” of the series...                      Nella Rose has just been electrocuted!                    This is absolutely grim. Poor Nella...                      Come on Nella!                    Once in the underground lair, Nella is facing a maze of lasers and hundreds of cockroaches. She has to use the magnetic watch the free the stars to bring back to camp.  But by breaking the lasers, she keeps on being forced to go back to the beginning. Agh! Come on Nella...                      Nella is ‘scared’ of James Bond-inspired Bushtucker Trial but is willing to give it a go…                    She has 10 minutes...                      Nella becomes a secret agent and enters the underground lair...                    Nella has been voted by the public to do the next trial. But what does it entail? Ant said: “Nella, this is No Time To Cry -through the fence and hidden deep underground is an evil villain’s secret lair. You have to take on the role of secret agent and infiltrate that secret lair, collecting stars as you go. The stars are hidden behind protected glass. To get them, you’re going to need this super hi-tech magnetic secret agent watch…”                      Nella is up for the second Bushtucker Trial....                    Meanwhile, Nigel Farage says he’s upset that the public hasn’t voted for him because he ‘wants’ to partake in the grisly Bushtucker Trials. Plus, as he adds: “[The Bushtucker Trials take up] 25 per cent of the air time.” Someone’s clearly got a PR campaign in mind...                      Nella accuses Fred of treating her like a ‘little girl’ as argument between pair escalates                                         First Dates star Fred Sirieix, 51, has upset YouTuber Nella Rose, 26, after saying that he is old enough to be her dad. In the Bush Telegraph, Nella explained: “Last night after dinner Fred made a comment about him basically how he could be my dad. I took offence to that because one of the first conversations we had together was me opening up about the fact that my dad’s passed away.” She continued: “I didn’t say anything about it last night because I was kind of just annoyed about it. So I slept on it and I kind of thought about it and I was just like, this is not the kind of person I want to be around.”  Nella decides to ignore Fred during breakfast to make a point, before asking him to ‘leave’ her alone. Fred realised he had upset Nella and asked her what he had done. Nella explained he’d made a comment the day before, saying: “You know that my mum’s dead, and you know that my dad’s dead. You know that, right? I’ve come to find out that every time I wanna get creative around the fire, or I want to have something my way, my own food that I am entitled to, my way, you tend to get an attitude, right?” Fred replied: “I am so sorry. Can I just say? First of all, I am sorry I’ve offended you. I am unaware that you felt offended. I am unaware that what I said would lead to this conversation, I only said that in a way because I am older than you, I am 51 and you’re 26.” Nella said back: “I’m not stupid, you’re not going to little girl me, you’re not.”  Nella said she had accepted his apology but concluded that the pair should not be friends.                      Grace Dent compares conditions in the jungle to ‘Day 11 of Glastonbury'                    ‘It’s like you’re getting ready to see Coldplay but later I’m actually just going to see Fred in his underpants’....                      Jamie Lynn Spears heard saying ‘I wanna go home’ in opening clip                    Jamie Lynn Spears could ‘quit I’m a Celebrity’ after saying she ‘did the wrong show’                      Time for another trial... but will there be tears?                    It’s time to see if Nella Rose can take on her second Bushtucker Trial of the series...                      Meet the contestants                    This year’s crop of celebrities includes soap stars, TV presenters and a controversial former politician-turned-GB News host.

Emotions were running high last night when Jamie Lynn Spears broke down in tears and confessed she was missing her children. But that wasn’t for long: JLS star Marvin Humes was there to serenade her and cheer her up again. Meanwhile, First Dates star Fred Sirieix told controversial politician Farage that his pro-Brexit campaign as the leader of the Ukip party was “shameful”  and the pair got into a heated political debate. At the end of the episode, the public voted (again) for YouTube star Nella Rose to take on the Bushtucker Trial tonight, which will be a challenge titled “No Time To Cry”. Nella will have to crawl through tunnels in an underground lair and retrieve gold stars for camp. But will she be able to face the spiders and creepy crawlies that await her without screaming “I’m a Celebrity!”?  Stay tuned to find out...                      I’m a Celeb lost another million viewers in Monday’s second episode                    The launch episode of I’m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! lost a staggering two million viewers on last year.

However, the 2023 premiere, which saw a new crop of stars enter the Australian jungle , had an audience peak of 7.8 million, and an average of just seven million. Now, it seems that the show is losing even more viewers. According to viewing figures for Monday night’s second episode with an average, there was an average of 6.1 million viewers tuning in, which is almost one million lower than Sunday’s launch episode. It is standard for the show to experience a drop in viewers after its launch episode – but does this mean “#BoycottImACelebrity” is having an impact on viewing figures?

Nigel Farage gets political about Boris Johnson and buts heads with Fred Sirieix about Brexit                    It was only a matter of time before things got political at camp... “What’s he like at a personal level?” asks Josie Gibson about the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. “Entertaining, surprisingly introverted,” said Farage. “He’s one of the most disorganised human beings that ever lived... b***** chaos...shambles,” he said. “What’s the benefit of Brexit?” Fred Sirieix jumps in, adding that he thought a level of “intolerance” was encouraged by the Brexit campaign.  “I thought it was shameful what you did Nigel,” said Fred, adding that the original UKIP campaign was “dehumanising” towards migrants. Nigel defended his stance, suggesting that there are “benefits” to Brexit, before other campmates, including Grace Dent, escaped the heated conversation to wash up the dishes instead.

Get Me Out of Here! might be about to lose its crown as the most-watched show on TV, with the 2023 launch episode  losing a huge number of viewers on last year.

However, the 2023 premiere, which saw a new crop of stars enter Australian jungle , had an audience peak of 7.8 million, and an average of just 7 million. This was down from the peak of 10 million, and average of 9.1 million, who watched the launch episode in November 2022, and viewers are attributing the severe dip to the inclusion of controversial ex-politician Nigel Farage.
