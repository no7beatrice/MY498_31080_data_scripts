   Tories' Brexit disarray; Letters to the Editor The Daily Telegraph (London) April 23, 2024 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 15 Length: 276 words Body   SIR - David Frost, a former Brexit negotiator, and Robert Jenrick, a former immigration minister, state: "We must get Brexit back on track or our biggest achievement will unravel" (Commentary, April 22). With so many Conservative MPs still fighting against our departure from the EU, how do Mr Jenrick and Lord Frost propose this will happen without widespread deselections before the general election? I have long felt that coalition governments lead to a block on legislative progress. Here we have an example of how even a single party, when it becomes too broad a church, risks ending its life scrapping like a weak coalition. A substantial majority means nowt when a party's main policies cause such irreconcilable differences. Brexit should mean Brexit. It cannot be watered down. Phillipa Dobson Birmingham SIR - I recently considered rejoining the Labour Party, but won't now. I thought one of Labour's stated aims was to reset our relationship with Europe and, in so doing, make amends for the damage done to young people and improve our economic outlook. The recent offer from the EU to give freedom of movement to 18-30-yearolds was enormously exciting and appeared to be the beginning of a thaw in our relationship. Not surprisingly, the Conservative Party was not interested. The fact that Labour has followed suit is a betrayal. It too has closed down opportunities for young people - cynically, it seems, for reasons of political expedience. As a parent and grandparent I feel despair at the gratuitous damage being inflicted on the younger generation. I cannot vote for a party that puts political calculations ahead of decency.
