   Effect of Brexit has been worse than Covid Birmingham Evening Mail April 16, 2024 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Midland Independent Newspapers plc All Rights Reserved Section: LETTERS; Pg. 12 Length: 270 words Body   TALKBACK certainly knows how to fire me up. A letter from Julie Willetts says Brexit is going to be a success because she voted for it. That's it, nothing www.else.No list of her own achievements and not a clue of the steps that can be taken to make it a success. Just sometime, somehow, it will work. So what have we got from Brexit so far? The average Briton was £2,000 worse off in 2023 and the average Londoner £3,400 worse off. That's worse off than if we'd remained in the EU but still been through Covid. I could have done with that £2,000. We are now short of care workers and construction workers and we can't get the workers to harvest the food we produce. One thing I do agree with Julie on is that our politicians are incapable of creating a successful UK. But wasn't it politicians who told us Brexit was going to be great for us? Julie says our economic demise is due to Covid. Yes. And the same politicians who gave us Brexit gave us over 220,000 Covid deaths - roughly 1 in 300 people. Covid was spread by close contact, so I will quote Taiwan's figures as they are an island closer to the point of outbreak than us and with a population density of 649 per sq km, compared to our 279. Their Covid deaths were about 1 in 2,900. You can't have it every way Julie, you can't say our politicians were spot on with Brexit but rubbish with everything else. By the way, when are you going to let us know the list of your achievements that gives you the right to lecture people like me who has had 15 years' experience in international trading and over 40 years of successful management in manufacturing?
