   Succession star Brian Cox says SNP has 'backed off' from Scottish independence dailyrecord.co.uk June 16, 2024 Sunday 10:44 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:3 Length: 613 words Byline: By, Chris McCall Highlight: The Dundee-born actor described Brexit as "this demon we don't talk about". Body   Brian Cox has claimed the SNP has "backed off" from promoting Scottish independence during the general election campaign. The Succession star said it was "something that worries me" ahead of the launch of the party's manifesto on Wednesday.  The Dundee-born actor is a long-term supporter of Scotland leaving the Union and is also a fierce critic of the UK's decision to leave the European Union in 201. Appearing on the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg show, Cox also described Brexit as "this demon we don't talk about". Asked if he was looking forward to the launch of the SNP's manifesto, he said: "I'm not quite sure what's going to happen, it could be, as Plaid Cymru have done, it could be backing away from the notion of independence." Asked if he thought they had backed off, he responded: "They have backed off. I don't know if Scotland has backed off, but I think that it's something that worries me, because I still believe in independence." Cox, whose main home is now New York, added: "I do believe in independence but I don't believe we shouldn't be part of these islands. I do believe we need a new kind of system. "I don't believe in a United Kingdom, I believe should have a sort of united federation of these islands, where each country should be independent but come together, instead of things being dictated, as we find in Scotland, on our behalf. "The fact is voted 62 per cent to stay in Europe, and we lost out completely, so we had no voice there." John Swinney has previously insisted independence will "proudly" be one "page one, line one" of his party's manifesto. Cox also blamed Brexit for the pressures facing public spending and the decline in services as a result. "My main problem, my main thing, is there's still this demon we don't talk about, which is Brexit and why we are so broke," he said. He pointed to research which suggested the UK economy had grown five per cent less in the years since the referendum in 2016. He added: "It seems to me that we are still suffering from that, and we've not done anything about it. So when we talk about other things, we can't really talk about where we are, as we are suffering from Brexit." Cox also said if he was a Conservative voter, he would be concerned by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage as he claimed the parliamentary candidate for Clacton is "really ruining that party". He called the other manifestos that were launched last week the "same old, same old". Cox added: "My feeling is just we need to get rid of the present Government. That's the most important thing as far as I'm concerned. "And I think at the moment it's a very... I don't know, I just wish I could be clearer about what's going on and I'm not. "And I'm not getting a sense of what's what and who's who; I'm getting a sense of who's against... but I'm not getting enough of where we're supposed to be going, particularly in relationship to poverty, particularly in relationship to the care of the working class, and I feel the working class has been a systematic sidestep for a very, very long time." An SNP spokesman said: "As the largest political party - and pro-independence party - in Scotland, the SNP will continue delivering for people across the country and making the case for a better Scotland with independence. "In the face of yet more cuts to public services, Brexit and a cost-of-living crisis, voting SNP at the General Election is a chance for people in Scotland to make their voice heard - which is why page one, line one of the SNP manifesto will read 'vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country'."
