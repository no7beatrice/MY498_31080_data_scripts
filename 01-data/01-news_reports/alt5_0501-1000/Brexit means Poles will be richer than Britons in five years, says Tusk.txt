   Brexit means Poles will be richer than Britons in five years, says Tusk telegraph.co.uk May 2, 2024 Thursday 12:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: WORLD NEWS; Version:2 Length: 372 words Byline: By James Crisp, Europe Editor Highlight: Polish prime minister says it’s better to be in EU as he promises GDP per capita will be higher in his country than UK by 2030 Body   Poles will be richer than Britons in five years time because of Brexit, Donald Tusk, the prime minister of Poland , has said. Mr Tusk, who was the president of the European Council during the Brexit negotiations, was notorious among Brexiteers for his scathing criticism  of the decision to leave the EU. He referred to a Labour forecast based on World Bank data that said Poland would outstrip the UK in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita by 2030. “A fierce debate is taking place in Great Britain, caused by the World Bank’s forecast that GDP per capita will be higher in Poland than in the UK in 2025,” said Mr Tusk on the 20th anniversary of Poland’s membership of the EU. “And I promise this: on the 25th anniversary, Poles will be richer than the British. It’s better to be in the EU.”                      ‘Special place in hell’ for Brexiteers                    The World Bank data shows GDP per capita in 2021 was $44,979 (£35,935) in Britain and $34,915 (£27,894) in Poland, which has an average growth of 3.6 per cent annually. That would mean Poland would overtake the UK by 2030, according to the calculations. In February, Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, used the data to bolster his arguments for a change of government at the next election. The Office for National Statistics estimated that the Polish-born population of the UK was 691,000 in 2020. Polish is the most spoken non-native language in Britain, and it is estimated almost a million Poles lived in the UK before the 2016 Brexit referendum. Mr Tusk won his second stint as prime minister , the job he left to become European Council president, last year. He campaigned on a pro-EU ticket against the nationalist Law and Justice government. While in Brussels, he said there was “a special place in hell” for Brexiteers  who had campaigned for Brexit without “even a sketch of a plan”. He prompted a dismayed response when he posted a picture on Instagram of him offering Theresa May a cake  at a tense 2018 summit in Salzburg, captioning the shot: “Sorry, no cherries”. The joke was a reference to the regular accusations from Brussels that Britain wanted to “have its cake and eat it” in the Brexit negotiations by “cherry-picking” access to the Single Market.
