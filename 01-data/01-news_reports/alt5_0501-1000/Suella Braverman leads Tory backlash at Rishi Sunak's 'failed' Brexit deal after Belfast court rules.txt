   Suella Braverman leads Tory backlash at Rishi Sunak's 'failed' Brexit deal after Belfast court rules against PM's small boats plan - but minister insists migrants will STILL be sent to Rwanda even if they head to Northern Ireland MailOnline May 14, 2024 Tuesday 1:09 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 1053 words Byline: Greg Heffer, Political Correspondent For Mailonline Body                        Suella Braverman today led a Tory backlash against Rishi Sunak's 'failed' Brexit deal following a bombshell court ruling in Northern Ireland. The High Court in Belfast decided yesterday that parts of the Illegal Migration Act cannot apply in Northern Ireland because of post-Brexit agreements with the EU. The intervention raised the prospect of it being impossible for the Home Office to deport migrants to Rwanda if they travel to Northern Ireland. The Government, which has pledged to appeal the ruling, has insisted this is not the case and a Home Office minister today warned migrants they are still 'within scope of relocation to Rwanda' if they cross the Irish Sea. But Mrs Braverman this afternoon tore into the Prime Minister's Windsor Framework agreement with Brussels in the wake of the court's judgment. Speaking in the House of Commons, the former home secretary claimed Mr Sunak's deal means Northern Ireland 'is effectively to be treated as part of the EU'. She was among a series of Tory Brexiteers to criticise Mr Sunak's Windsor Framework, which he signed in February last year to end a long-running row with the EU over post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland. During an urgent question on the Belfast court ruling, Mrs Braverman told MPs: 'In the decision the judge found that section 7a of the Withdrawal Agreement Act - as amended by the Windsor Framework - must be read to mean that Northern Ireland is effectively to be treated as part of the EU. 'I believed the assurances made to me at the time, but isn't it now patently clear the Windsor Framework has operated in way to undermine our sovereignty, to undermine Northern Ireland's place in the UK. 'And, I'm afraid, has fundamentally failed upon its first contact with reality.' Fellow former Cabinet minister Sir John Redwood urged Mr Sunak to bring forward new laws to assert UK control over border policies. He told the Commons: 'We voted in a referendum to end the rule of EU law throughout the UK, including Northern Ireland. 'Isn't the only way out of this. given the muddle the courts are creating, to have an urgent short piece of legislation that asserts beyond doubt we control our own borders?' Mark Francois, the chairman of the European Research Group of Tory Brexiteers, called for the Government to consider quitting the European Convention on Human Rights. 'On the Windsor Framework: we told you so,' he said. 'On the judgment itself, legally all roads lead not to Rome but in this case to Strasbourg and the ECHR.' He added: 'Hasn't the time now come for a Conservative Government to include in our election manifesto a clear commitment to seek to renegotiate this convention with our European partners. 'But, should those negotiations fail, to leave. Because if we aren't prepared to walk away they'll never take us seriously.' This afternoon's urgent question in the Commons on the Belfast court ruling was asked by DUP leader Gavin Robinson, who has warned Northern Ireland could become 'a magnet for asylum seekers'. He blasted the Government for previously dismissing his party's concerns, saying: 'The issues that were elucidated yesterday by the High Court and Belfast were fairly and thoroughly explored in this House, and in the other place, during both the passage of the Illegal Migration Act and the Safety of Rwanda act as well. 'When I and my colleagues raised these concerns here in Parliament, we were told by the Government we were wrong. And, yet, the High Court yesterday in Belfast said we were right.' Mr Robinson asked what steps the Government is taking to secure 'a British Isles solution to immigration, outside of the control of the EU'. Home Office minister Tom Pursglove said the Government intends to appeal against the judgment and would 'not be deterred'. He said: 'We've consistently made clear that the rights commitments in the Belfast/Good Friday agreement should be interpreted as they were always intended and not expanded to cover reserved issues like illegal migration. 'We are also equally clear that immigration is a reserved matter, which has always been applied uniformly across the UK. 'We do not accept that the Good Friday Agreement should be read so creatively as to extend to matters such as tackling illegal migration, which is a UK-wide issue and not in any way related to the original intention of the Good Friday Agreement.' Mr Pursglove also told MPs the Government was pushing ahead with the Rwanda plan 'on a UK-wide basis'. 'There is no benefit to anybody who thinks going to Northern Ireland will lead to them not being within scope of relocation to Rwanda,' he added.  Earlier, in a round of TV and radio interviews this morning, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps insisted Northern Ireland would not be an 'exception to the rule' in the wider UK. He told GB News: 'We will ensure we will do everything that's required to make sure... that Northern Ireland can't be in this position. Because we believe firmly in being able to control our own borders. 'We are absolutely going to appeal that ruling. We won't let Northern Ireland be an exception - exemption - to the rule in the United Kingdom.' In its ruling yesterday, Belfast High Court said provisions of the UK's Illegal Migration Act should be disapplied in Northern Ireland, as they undermine human rights protections guaranteed in the region under post-Brexit arrangements. Mr Justice Humphreys also said aspects of the Act were incompatible with the ECHR. He delivered judgment on Monday in two challenges against the Act that focused on the peace process human rights protections guaranteed by the Windsor Framework.  The judge found that several elements of the Act do cause a 'significant' diminution of the rights enjoyed by asylum seekers residing in Northern Ireland under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. 'I have found that there is a relevant diminution of right in each of the areas relied upon by the applicants,' he said. He added: 'The applicants' primary submission therefore succeeds. Each of the statutory provisions under consideration infringes the protection afforded to RSE (Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity) in the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement.' The judge ruled that the sections of the Act that were the subject of the legal challenges should be 'disapplied' in Northern Ireland. Load-Date: May 14, 2024  End of Document
