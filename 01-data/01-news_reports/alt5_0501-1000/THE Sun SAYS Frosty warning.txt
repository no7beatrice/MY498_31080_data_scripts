   THE Sun SAYS Frosty warning The Sun (England) June 19, 2024 Wednesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved  Section: EDITORIAL; OPINION, LEADING ARTICLES; Pg. 12 Length: 244 words Body   LORD Frost knows a thing or two about dealing with the EU. As our chief Brexit negotiator he spent months battling the legalistic, dogmatic Eurocrats bent on overturning or diluting our democratic vote to leave. Their fury at Britain's decision to quit ran long and deep then - and still burns today. To coin Kevin Keegan's infamous phrase, Brussels would "love it" if Britain came running back. So when Labour talks of renegotiating our Brexit deal, alarm bells should start ringing. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves says she is suggesting only modest realignment on certain rules. But from bitter experience, Lord Frost knows that any renegotiation with the EU, however minor initially, ultimately won't come free of charge. The price likely to be paid will be ever closer ties - and the long-overdue bonfire of Brussels' red tape being snuffed out. Step-by-step, we face being brought fully back into line with European rules over which we have no say - and beyond that the prospect of rejoining entirely. Labour's leadership has tried hard to avoid Brexit during this election. Sir Keir Starmer has insisted he "respects" the public's decision to leave. But voters will remember that he campaigned hard for a second referendum and tried repeatedly to thwart Brexit deals in the Commons. It's not unreasonable for them to ask: is Starmer still a Remainer at heart, who wishes Brexit never happened? They deserve a much clearer answer to that question before July 4 - not after.
