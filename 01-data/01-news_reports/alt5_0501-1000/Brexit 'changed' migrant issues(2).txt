   Brexit 'changed' migrant issues The Daily Telegraph (London) April 25, 2024 Thursday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 6 Length: 225 words Byline: Charles Hymas Body   BRITAIN can no longer return Channel migrants to France because of Brexit, says Lord Cameron. The Foreign Secretary said a migrant returns deal with France to help break up smuggler gangs and stop people making the perilous journey across the Channel was "simply not possible". He said "the situation we're in" means a deal in place when he was prime minister to send migrants back to France was "not possible" now. Asked whether this was because of Brexit, he said: "Because of the situation we're in, because of the attitude of others and all the rest of it." The pre-Brexit Dublin Agreement allowed the UK to return migrants to "safe" EU countries where they should have claimed asylum if they had passed through them. This was scrapped under Brexit and was not replaced. His comments come just two days after Rishi Sunak's Rwanda Bill, aimed at blocking further setbacks to a controversial deportation scheme, finally passed through Parliament. Asked whether he would have pursued the policy while he was in No 10, Lord Cameron told ITV's Peston show: "We had a totally different situation because (we) could return people directly to France. "Now, I'd love that situation to be the case again, that's the most sensible thing. People land on a beach in Kent, you take them straight back to France, you therefore break the model of the people smugglers." Load-Date: April 25, 2024  End of Document
