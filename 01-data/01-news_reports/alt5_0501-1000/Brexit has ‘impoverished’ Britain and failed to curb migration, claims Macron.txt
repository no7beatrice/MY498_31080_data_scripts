   Brexit has ‘impoverished’ Britain and failed to curb migration, claims Macron telegraph.co.uk May 2, 2024 Thursday 2:22 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: WORLD NEWS; Version:5 Length: 784 words Byline: By Henry Samuel in in Paris Highlight: Leaving the EU has ‘impoverished’ the UK and failed to solve the country’s immigration problems, says French president Body   Brexit has “impoverished” the UK and failed to solve the country’s immigration problems, Emmanuel Macron has said. The French president  also took aim at European nationalists ahead of the bloc’s elections in June , saying they were all “hidden Brexiteers”. “Brexit has impoverished the United Kingdom,” he told The Economist. “Brexit has done nothing to solve immigration in the UK. Well, despite that, some people think it doesn’t look so bad. But nobody dares to say that anything is wrong. And so nobody is taking responsibility for anything.” Mr Macron also accused Europe’s nationalists of “distorting the European debate” and glossing over the risks of leaving. He said: “I say to Europeans: Wake up. Wake up! They are hidden Brexiteers. All European nationalists are hidden Brexiteers. It’s all the same lies. “Make no mistake. If you entrust the keys to people who think like they do, there is no reason why Europe should become a great power. In a way, it’s as if we were saying it’s not a problem if we entrust the bank to robbers. When they are around the table, they take Europe hostage.” A spokesman for Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, hit back at Mr Macron’s claims about Brexit, saying: “Clearly, as a long-time Brexiteer , he [Mr Sunak] would not agree. We left the EU to get control of our borders and in doing so that’s how we’re leading the pack with our partnership to break the model of the criminal gangs. “In terms of the economy, I point you to our track record. Britain is now the fourth largest exporter globally, overtaking France.” Mr Macron’s centrist Renaissance party faces being trounced by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally  (RN) in the upcoming European Parliament elections on June 9. Mr Macron suffered a political setback on Thursday after France’s broadcast watchdog Arcom ruled that the two-hour-long speech he made at the Sorbonne should be deducted from his party’s overall airtime for the European election campaign. The Elysée had argued he was speaking as president of all France when he said that Europe was in mortal danger, notably from nationalist, illiberal rivals.                      ‘They want to destroy it’                    Mr Macron also pointed the finger at RN, whose campaign is being run by 28-year-old party leader Jordan Bardella, and which “wanted to pull out of Europe, out of the euro, out of everything”, he said. “Now it no longer says anything. It’s reaping the benefits of Europe, while wanting to destroy it without saying anything.” He gave the example of RN’s failure to vote for the EU Common Agricultural Policy, adding: “But where are they going to find the €9.5 billion in funding? They don’t explain it. And that’s true in every country.” He made an exception, however, for Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister , whose Brothers of Italy party has neo-fascist roots, saying that it had “a European approach”. But “after that, the best way of building together is to have as few nationalists as possible,” he insisted. Returning to France’s relationship with the UK, he said the two countries’ Lancaster House defence and security treaties made Britain a “privileged partner of France”. He wanted to “deepen this” while having a “wider strategic discussion with all Europeans who are prepared to do so”, notably through the 47-member European Political Community created in the wake of Russia’s assault on Ukraine. “I don’t think [Brexit] should prevent us from moving forward at full speed on strategic and military issues,” he said.                      ‘Strategic wake-up call’                    Bolstering Europe’s defence should not “exclude countries that have never been in the EU, or recently were, such as Norway, the United Kingdom or the Balkans”, he went on, citing joint missile programmes, “including with the British”. He insisted that the issue of sending Western troops to Ukraine  would legitimately arise if Russia broke through Ukrainian front lines and Kyiv made such a request. Most of France’s allies have ruled out sending any forces  after he refused to do so recently in the name of “strategic ambiguity”. Mr Macron said: “If Russia decided to go further, we will in any case all have to ask ourselves this question” of sending troops, describing his refusal to rule out such a move as a “strategic wake-up call for my counterparts”. He also argued that Europe must defend its strategic interests in its economic relations with China, days before President Xi Jinping’s state visit to France. “There are many sectors in which China requires producers to be Chinese, because they are too sensitive. Europeans must be able to do the same and say that some sectors fall within the scope of European national security,” he said. Load-Date: May 3, 2024  End of Document
