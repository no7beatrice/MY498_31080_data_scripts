   Sunak accuses Farage of playing into Putin’s hands as Reform leader doubles down on Ukraine claim telegraph.co.uk June 22, 2024 Saturday 5:22 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:6 Length: 6807 words Byline: By Will Hazell, Political Correspondent and Alex Barton and Patrick Sawer, Senior News Reporter Body   Rishi Sunak has accused Nigel Farage of “playing into Putin’s hands” by saying that the West “provoked” Russia into invading Ukraine. Follow The Telegraph’s general election liveblog The Reform UK leader received a barrage of criticism from across the political spectrum on Saturday after he claimed that the “ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union” gave Vladimir Putin a justification to attack. The Prime Minister said the comments were “completely wrong”, while Sir Keir Starmer labelled them “disgusting”. Ben Wallace, the former defence secretary, branded Mr Farage a “pub bore” with “simplistic answers” to “complex problems”. However, writing for The Telegraph, Mr Farage refused to back down, claiming that his warnings about Western foreign policy had been “proved right”. The row erupted after Mr Farage was asked in a BBC Panorama interview with Nick Robinson on Friday why he had “blamed the West” for Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He replied: “It was obvious to me that the ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union was giving this man a reason to his Russian people to say, ‘they’re coming for us again’ and to go to war.” Pressed on whether hisrhetoric was echoing that of the Russian president,  he said: “But, hang on a second, we provoked this war. It’s – you know, of course, it’s his fault, he’s used what we’ve done as an excuse.” On Saturday, Mr Sunak said: “What he said was completely wrong and only plays into Putin’s hands. “This is a man who deployed nerve agents on the streets of Britain, who’s doing deals with countries like North Korea. And this kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security, the security of our allies that rely on us and only emboldens Putin further.” Sir Keir said: “Nigel Farage’s comments were disgusting. Russia is the aggressor and Putin bears the responsibility.” Speaking on the BBC’s Today programme, Mr Wallace claimed that the Reform leader was “a bit like that pub bore we have all met at the end of the bar who often says if ‘I was running the country’ and presents very simplistic answers to … complex problems”. He added that the comments reflected a “rather odd admiration of totalitarian leaders that we hear from parts of the Trump campaign and some of the Farage lot – ‘oh well he’s a good old strong leader’”. Mr Wallace said: “Well he might be a good old strong leader  but he’s done that at the expense of sacrificing half a million Russians dead, injured or deserted and on track to be lost by the end of this year. I don’t want that anywhere in our politics.” But in his article for The Telegraph, Mr Farage claimed he had been the victim of a “slur”. “I am not and never have been an apologist or supporter of Putin,” he said. “His invasion of Ukraine was immoral, outrageous and indefensible. As a champion of national sovereignty, I believe that Putin was entirely wrong to invade the sovereign nation of Ukraine. Nobody can fairly accuse me of being an appeaser. I have never sought to justify Putin’s invasion in any way and I’m not now. “But that doesn’t change the fact that I saw it coming a decade ago, warned that it was coming and am one of the few political figures who has been consistently right and honest about Russia’s Ukraine war. “What I have been saying for the past 10 years is that the West has played into Putin’s hands, giving him the excuse to do what he wanted to do anyway.” He added: “If you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don’t be surprised if he responds.” Mr Farage claimed that he was questioning “political conformism” on Ukraine. “The escalation of British support for the war in Ukraine has not even been an issue in this election campaign, since the old parties all agree with it,” he said.On Saturday, he was gained support fromGeorge Galloway, the veteran hard-Left politician  and outspoken Nato critic, who posted on X: “The absolute hysteria over Nigel Farage telling the truth about the Ukraine war is the shape of things to come. “The establishment narrative over this and a hundred other things is a Potemkin Village – paper thin!”                      22 Jun 2024-04:21PM GMT                                         Recap of today’s events                    Nigel Farage has faced a storm of criticism over his claims the West was responsible for Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Rishi Sunak, Keir Starmer, Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, John Swinney, the SNP leader, and Ben Wallace, the former defence secretary, all hit out at Mr Farage for his comments. Separately, Sir Keir ruled out rejoining the EU following Kemi Badenoch’s claim that a vote for Labour was a vote to overturn Brexit.  While on the campaign trail on Saturday the Labour leader pledged a “fundamental reset to respect and dignity” for the Windrush generation. He also committed to tackling knife crime during a meeting with a grieving mother whose son had been stabbed to death.  Later on Sir Keir spoke to reporters in Vauxhall on Saturday and said he is proud of Labour’s track record on women’s rights in response to criticism from JK Rowling. The Harry Potter author and former Labour donor had previously accused the party had “abandoned” women. Thank you for following our live blog.

In an interview with the BBC, Mr Farage said “we provoked this war” and drew a link between the war and the expansion of Nato and the European Union. But responding to the Reform UK leader, Mr Swinney told journalists on a campaign stop in Edinburgh: “I this these are some of the most appalling remarks I’ve heard, literally in my life, and they’re of an extraordinary degree of absurdity and danger. “Vladimir Putin has voluntarily invaded a sovereign country and nobody provoked him to, nobody was a threat to Vladimir Putin. “Nigel Farage has confirmed what all of us have suspected of him-that he is a dangerous man. “And that he is a traitor to the interests of the people of these islands, and the people of Ukraine.”                      22 Jun 2024-03:55PM GMT                                         George Galloway defends Nigel Farage over Ukraine claims                    George Galloway has defended Nigel Farage after he claimed the West was responsible for Russia invading Ukraine.

Writing on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Galloway said:  The absolute hysteria over @Nigel_Farage  telling the truth about the #Ukraine  war is the shape of things to come.

It’s a reputation which owes itself not just to the “Royal” appellation and the “Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells” stereotype, but to the fact that for the last 114 years this affluent west Kent town has been represented by a Tory MP. But with a little over a week before the election , people are starting to contemplate the previously unthinkable: are the Conservatives about to lose this seat? That was the prediction by a YouGov MRP poll last week, which forecast the Liberal Democrats  winning the constituency with 40 per cent of the vote to the Tories’ 31 per cent.

The actress told Sky News: “It’s extraordinary.

But we are also one of the most rich, so this is not good for anybody. “Anyone who has ever written about our country (has written) about the beauty of these islands and they are being despoiled, polluted and destroyed at an unprecedented rate. “We have to take action now.

The Labour Party has pledged to charge VAT on private school fees if it wins the general election  on July 4, in a policy that has drawn fierce criticism. Headteachers fear that this would drive up school fees, rendering private education unaffordable  for many families and leading to thousands of pupils entering the state system. In several parts of the country, state schools would run out of space completely within five years of the policy being introduced, according to The Telegraph’s calculations.

Absolutely fantastic.” He added: “I know I will be asked what is my favourite song and I am not going to pretend I have got every album and know every song, although Change is the one for obvious reasons.” The Labour manifesto, entitled Change, shares its name with a song from Swift’s 2008 album Fearless. Sir Keir added: “What I learned last night is my daughter knows every album, every song, and every word of every song, and she wasn’t alone among the teenage girls who were there. “It was utterly brilliant.”                      22 Jun 2024-12:14PM GMT                                         Comment: Nigel Farage has just proven that he’s not a serious leader                    Nigel Farage’s analysis of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine could hardly be more wrong.  He claims that Nato and EU expansion was provocative.  In fact it was Western weakness and timidity that encouraged Putin’s aggression in 2022.  Rather than making any attempt to oppose Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014, or helping Ukraine to do so, Western governments called on Kyiv to take no action that might lead to escalation.

He said: “Today is Windrush day so it’s a day about telling the history of Windrush, the great contribution that’s been made to this country and the change that brought about, but it also needs to be a reset day. “And that’s why I was very pleased to be able to talk to people about this reset today because the compensation scheme which is there to deal with the real injustice is going too slowly. We’ve got too many examples of people who’ve died before they’ve got the compensation that they’re entitled to. “The Windrush unit needs to be re-established in the Home Office and we will set up a permanent commissioner to be a champion and an advocate for the Windrush generation to make sure that these injustices are put right.”                      22 Jun 2024-11:52AM GMT                                         Steve Reed takes selfie at Bournemouth beach on campaign trail                    Steve Reed, Labour’s shadow environment secretary, took a group selfie during a visit to Bournemouth beach while on the campaign trail.

The church leader launched an anti-knife crime initiative following the death of her son, opening a gym in Brixton for local youths. Holding her hand, Sir Keir told Pastor Jones: “You don’t need me to tell you how shocking this issue is and what you’ve been through. “We’re going to keep working with you on this and it’s really important for us to listen to you. “A lot of people couldn’t do what you’ve done and you shouldn’t have had to. You’ve got to keep on at us. You have the right to be in my ear about this.”                      22 Jun 2024-10:58AM GMT                                         Keir Starmer rules out rejoining the EU and rejects Kemi Badenoch’s Brexit claims                    Sir Keir Starmer ruled out rejoining the EU and rejected Kemi Badenoch’s claims that a vote for Labour was a vote to overturn Brexit. The Labour leader said that while he would try to negotiate a better trade deal with the EU if he becomes Prime Minister he categorically rejected a return to the single market. Speaking to reporters after attending a coffee morning with members of the Windrush generation, he said: “We’re not going to region the single market. We haven’t have a better deal with the EU than the botched one we have now.” Rejecting Ms Badenoch’s claim that Labour will reverse Brexit if it wins the general election, he repeatedly said there was no prospect of Britain rejoining the EU. He said: “I voted to remain and I campaigned to remain. What the referendum did was throw politics into turmoil for three years. It caused huge volatility.” But Sir Keir added: “The problems with low growth started well before Brexit. All of that is work we can start off on Day 1 of a Labour government.”                      22 Jun 2024-10:55AM GMT                                         West not to blame for Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, says Sir Ed Davey                    Vladimir Putin and Russia are to blame for the invasion of Ukraine, not the West, Sir Ed Davey said in response to Nigel Farage’s comments. The Lib Dem leader said during a visit to south east England: “It is Putin and Russia who are to blame for this, no one else. “I strongly support the efforts that Britain has made to support Ukrainians. I wish we had done more actually, and I think British people would be shocked if we do anything else.” He added: “I don’t share any values with Nigel Farage.” Sir Ed went on: “My message to the British people we need to support the Ukrainian people. “This is a time of deep insecurity in our world. I’m worried when I look to later this year, if Donald Trump wins the presidential election, it’s possible that the United States will give less support to Ukraine and Britain and the rest of Europe will have to stand up and work together.”                      22 Jun 2024-10:53AM GMT                                         All parties must commit to compensation of Windrush victims, says Sir Ed Davey                    All political parties must commit to proper compensation for victims of the Windrush scandal, Sir Ed Davey has said. Asked about Labour’s promise to expedite compensation, the Lib Dem leader said: “I think that’s right. I think we have been disappointed that the Conservatives said they were going to compensate people affected by the Windrush scandal. “I think the British public want them to, they’ve seen how people have been so badly treated.” He added: “I think all parties should commit to proper compensation for people who’ve been victims of the Windrush scandal.”                      22 Jun 2024-10:50AM GMT                                         Sir Ed Davey feeds chickens on campaign trail in Lewes                    Sir Ed Davey has been feeding chickens on a farm in Ditchling, East Sussex, while on the campaign trail. He was joined by James McCleary, Liberal Democrat candidate for Lewes and Lib Dems members on his first visit on Saturday. The Liberal Democrats leader said “this is the best chicken photo op ever” as he fed poultry flocking to him on a farm as his party announced what his party would do to tackle water pollution of chalk streams on Saturday. Lewes is a key target seat to win from the Conservatives at the General Election.                      22 Jun 2024-10:49AM GMT                                         Pictured: Keir Starmer at coffee morning with members of the Windrush generation                                         22 Jun 2024-10:16AM GMT                                         Labour should not be allowed to ‘sleepwalk into Number 10’ says Sunak                    Rishi Sunak has said Labour should not be allowed to “sleepwalk into Number 10” amid claims colleagues are focusing on preventing a Labour “supermajority”. When asked by broadcasters if he was “deluded” for thinking he could win the election, Mr Sunak said: “Of course I’m going to fight hard until the last day of this election because there is a choice for the country. “Continue having your taxes cut with the Conservatives, providing you with that financial security, protecting your pension, getting down immigration. The alternative is handing a blank cheque to the Labour Party, and once you’ve handed them a blank cheque you won’t be able to get it back. And that means your taxes are going to go up by thousands of pounds. “Don’t let Labour sleepwalk into Number 10, scrutinise their plans, ask what it means for you and your family. “Can you really afford Labour’s thousands of pounds of tax rises? I want to keep cutting your taxes. That’s the choice that everyone has in front of them in a couple of weeks’ time.”                      22 Jun 2024-10:09AM GMT                                         Pictured: Nigel Farage on the campaign trail in Clacton                                         22 Jun 2024-10:07AM GMT                                         Farage is a pub bore with simplistic answers, says Ben Wallace amid Putin row                    Nigel Farage is a “pub bore” with simplistic answers to complex problems, said Ben Wallace after the Reform UK leader suggested the West provoked Russia into invading Ukraine. The former defence secretary, who is not standing in the general election, was speaking on BBC Radio 4 and said: “I think Nigel Farage is a bit like that pub bore we have all met at the end of the bar who often says ‘if I was running the country’ and presents very simplistic answers to actually I am afraid in the 21st century complex problems. “It is not that easy to govern a country but also to find international solutions to problems.” Mr Wallace added: “If he became prime minister tomorrow morning, what is his solution to dealing with a President Putin that he alleges he admires? A man who remember was involved in the murder of a British citizen, Dawn Sturgess, with deployment of nerve agent in Salisbury. “Is his answer to that ‘we provoked him’? He is going to have to deal with the real world.” It comes after Mr Farage said in a BBC Panorama interview that the “ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the European Union” gave Vladimir Putin a reason to justify war. He echoed this sentiment in a tweet on Friday night by saying the “EU was wrong to expand eastward”.                      22 Jun 2024-10:02AM GMT                                         Sunak backs Home Office after criticism from Windrush campaigners in citizenship row                    The Prime Minister has defended the Home Office amid claims from Windrush campaigners that thousands of people still have not been granted citizenship. Rishi Sunak said: “So many people suffered an injustice under successive governments over a long time. And since all this came to light a while ago, the Home Office has been working hard to rectify things. “I think over 16,000 people now have been given the appropriate documentation that they deserve and tens of millions of pounds in compensation has been paid out and something like 200 different community and outreach events have also been organised. “But of course the Home Office is always reflecting, taking on feedback and seeing how it can improve and make sure that we right the wrongs of the past.”                      22 Jun 2024-09:52AM GMT                                         Sunak says he loves the UK ‘deeply’ after Farage accusation he doesn’t understand British culture                    Rishi Sunak has said he loves the UK “deeply” after being accused of not understanding “our culture” by Nigel Farage. The Prime Minister said: “I love this country deeply for what it has done for my family. “My grandparents emigrated here with very little and two generations later I have the enormous privilege of being our Prime Minister. “And that’s why I will work my hardest to repay this country for everything that it has done for my family.”                      22 Jun 2024-09:49AM GMT                                         Sunak says Farage ‘completely wrong’ to say West provoked Russia into Ukraine invasion                    Rishi Sunak has said Nigel Farage was “completely wrong” to say the West “provoked” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Prime Minister told reporters: “What he said was completely wrong and only plays into (Vladimir) Putin’s hands. “This is a man who deployed nerve agents on the streets of Britain, who’s doing deals with countries like North Korea. And this kind of appeasement is dangerous for Britain’s security, the security of our allies that rely on us and only emboldens Putin further.”                      22 Jun 2024-09:29AM GMT                                         SNP politician backs JK Rowling amid women’s rights row                    Joanna Cherry, the SNP politician, has backed JK Rowling after the author criticised Labour’s approach to women’s rights.  Ms Cherry has been a vocal critic of the SNP’s gender policy. Posting on X, formerly Twitter, she said: “I agree with JK Rowling. Keir Starmer’s equivocation on women’s rights is pathetic. It is a clear sign of what’s to come and women should think very carefully when they are casting their votes “It is going to be really important to have strong independent minded voices in the next parliament to speak up for women and LGB people. if re-elected that’s what I will continue to do”. Labour has claimed it is the “party of women’s equality” despite the criticism from the Harry Potter author over its stance on trans rights.                      22 Jun 2024-09:14AM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak visits safer seats as Tory campaign gets more defensive                    With just two weeks to go until election day on July 4 , Rishi Sunak appears to be doubling down on his strategy of ensuring the largest Tory majorities hold. Having visited just one Labour seat on the trail so far, the Prime Minister’s campaign footprint suggests his focus is increasingly on staving off an insurgent Reform and the resurgent Liberal Democrats.

The 64-year-old who presents the Amazon series Clarkson’s Farm in which he tends to his Diddly Squat Farm in West Oxfordshire, also criticised Labour’s farming policy laid out in its manifesto.  Writing in his column in The Sun, he said: “So now we arrive at the Labour Party, and I’m sorry, but I cannot find a single redeeming feature. “Their manifesto contains just 87 words on farming. Which, when translated into English basically say ‘We hate you, you meat-eating rural halfwits.’” He added: “I get, of course, that people are fed up with the Tories, but I’d rather vote for my dog than Sir Starmer’s merry bunch of ideological nincompoops.”                      22 Jun 2024-08:30AM GMT                                         Starmer will reverse Brexit, warns Badenoch                    Labour will reverse Brexit if it wins the general election, Kemi Badenoch has warned. In an interview with The Telegraph, the Business Secretary says Brexit is a “10 to 20-year project” and that any benefits will disappear if Sir Keir Starmer becomes prime minister.  She also understands why some on the Right are “frustrated” with the Conservatives but has urged them not to defect to Reform UK , saying it would be a wasted vote. Instead, she tells them to “look at the bad things we have stopped that will come in under Labour”.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme: “I think saying some of these comments which is that rather odd admiration of totalitarian leaders that we hear from the part of the Trump campaign and some of the Farage lot, ‘well he is a good old strong leader’. “Well he might be a good old strong leader but he has done that at the expense of sacrificing half a million Russians, dead, injured or deserted are on track to be lost by the end of this year. “I don’t want that anywhere in our politics.” Asked to comment on Boris Johnson’s legacy as prime minister, Mr Wallace said: “All I know is when I served with Boris Johnson as his defence secretary, and Rishi Sunak, they both leant in and supported defence.” He added: “I suspect my Labour counterpart (John Healey) if he were to be defence secretary will be wanting more from Rachel Reeves and will get precisely zilch.”                      22 Jun 2024-08:00AM GMT                                         EU wrong for expanding eastward, says Farage                    Nigel Farage said in a tweet on Friday that Putin was wrong to invade Ukraine, but claimed that the EU was also at fault for expanding eastward. I am one of the few figures that have been consistent & honest about the war with Russia.Putin was wrong to invade a sovereign nation, and the EU was wrong to expand eastward.The sooner we realise this, the closer we will be to ending the war and delivering peace. https://t.co/o1nJt8mDlR                      22 Jun 2024-07:57AM GMT                                         Recap: The West provoked Russian invasion of Ukraine, claims Farage                    The West provoked Russia into invading Ukraine, Nigel Farage  has said.
