   Reform playing to people’s fears, says Kemi Badenoch — as it happened thetimes.co.uk June 27, 2024 Thursday 6:19 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 7685 words Byline: Lara Wildenberg, Georgia Lambert, Aubrey Allegretti, Ed Halford, Max Kendix, George Sandeman Highlight: Business secretary dismisses speculation Conservatives will collaborate with Nigel Farage as Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer try to move on from betting scandal Body   The election gambling scandal still threatens to overshadow the Labour and Tory campaigns with only a week to go before polling day. At least seven Met Police officers are now being investigated over bets on the timing of the poll. Reform campaigners have been recorded saying migrants should be used for army target practice and that the party would turn police officers into paramilitaries. Andrew Parker, a canvasser, was filmed by an undercover reporter for Channel 4 telling a prospective voter: “Get the young recruits there, yeah, with guns on the f****** beach, target practice. F****** just shoot them.” George Jones, who runs events for Nigel Farage’s campaign having previously worked with him at Ukip and the Brexit Party, was heard saying they would “bring back the noose” and “our police officers will be paramilitaries”. Farage said their comments were “appalling” and that they “will no longer be with the campaign”.                    Read in full:                    Shoot illegal migrants, say Reform campaigners The Conservative party needs to change the way it communicates to attract younger voters to its cause, Kemi Badenoch has said. The business secretary told The Times that the party needed a broader offer to the electorate rather than concentrating on a set of policies attractive to just one demographic. “The way we communicate needs to be updated for the 2020s and beyond,” she said. “The [messaging] doesn’t quite work. People hear about pensions and triple lock and people under-65 don’t think it’s relevant to them. We need to have a broader conversation.” The Tories’ proposal to reintroduce a form of national service for 18 year olds has been mocked by some. One 16-year-old confronted Rishi Sunak at a pub in Devon last month and asked him: “Why do you hate young people so much?” People who are serious about politics are not standing as MPs because of the attacks and threats they would face, Kemi Badenoch has said. She made the comments to The Times after being asked about the difficulties Reform are facing over the quality of their candidates. It was revealed today that one appeared on a leaked list of British National Party members. Badenoch said Reform was made up of “all sorts of odds and sods” but that the broader problem was quality candidates being put off from political service. She cited recent comments about her by the actor David Tennant who said she should “shut up” and not exist. Badenoch, who is minister for women and equalities, has been outspoken in her views on transgender rights and the need to protect female-only spaces. “A lot of people don’t want to do politics anymore. I’m standing against a 21-year-old student activist and someone who is a bit of a crank for Reform,” she said. “It’s bricks through our windows, death threats … all for £80,000 a year, no thanks. It opens up the [political] space for all sorts of people who are not serious.” Reform is a “grievance outfit not a political party” and they are “playing to people’s fears”, Kemi Badenoch has said. It has been speculated that the Conservatives may be forced to collaborate with Reform in the next parliament if they lose hundreds of seats at this election. Nigel Farage founded Reform in 2018, naming it after a Canadian party that became the country’s second largest in 1997. A few years later it merged to become Canada’s modern-day Conservative party. “I don’t think a party that is over 200 years old should merge with something that was cooked up last week,” Badenoch told The Times’s political columnist Rachel Sylvester. Kemi Badenoch has described Labour’s plan requiring large businesses to report pay disparities for ethnic minorities as something belonging to apartheid-era South Africa. Labour has said companies already report pay disparities for gender, and that their policy would extend this to ethnicity.  After her speech to a British Chambers of Commerce conference, she told The Times’s political columnist Rachel Sylvester that the plan was something from “apartheid South Africa and what they do now in China and Myanmar”. The business secretary, who also serves as minister for women and equalities, added: “We should not be going anywhere near this stuff”. She said enforcement would lead to “thought police chasing companies up and down the country”. Bill Gates has said political resistance is slowing down the world’s transition to green energy and that the net zero emissions targets set for 2050 were unlikely to be met. The Microsoft founder owns an energy investment firm, which supports companies aiming to cut greenhouse gases through technical innovations. Speaking in London, he said: “Politics could slow this stuff down. Rich countries not only need to [reduce] their own emissions but they also need to be the primary source of both the risk capital and the bootstrap funding.” “I don’t think I’m crazy to be optimistic, though I’d be the first to admit that hitting this specific goal of absolutely net zero emissions by 2050, we’re not likely to achieve that.” Rishi Sunak has drawn criticism over his decision last year to delay the implementation of several net zero policies including a ban on the sale of new petrol cars and gas boilers. Tom Tugendhat, the security minister, has repeatedly refused to rule out running for the Conservative Party leadership and instead criticised Sir Keir Starmer for offering “waffle” in last night’s BBC debate. When asked on ITV News if he would put his name forward to lead the Conservative Party if Rishi Sunak loses the general election, he replied: “Well the first thing to do is win this leadership race. This leadership race is about making sure we get the right person into No 10.” Tugendhat said Sunak was “answering questions, offering solutions and “constantly challenging our own country, our own party and the whole government to do even better” in the debate on Wednesday night. Tugendhat said Starmer had offered “nothing” but “waffle” and was “identifying a problem, pointing at a problem, admiring a problem” but “never trying to solve it”. Sir Ed Davey has described the gambling scandal afflicting Westminster as awful and called for a review to establish whether clearer rules are needed for those involved in politics. “The idea that people walked into 10 Downing Street, were told the date of an election, and it appears … they went and bet on something that they knew the outcome of — I think everyone can see that’s wrong,” he said. “And I think these MPs who appear to have bet against themselves — that’s highly questionable too. We need an urgent review, as soon as this is all over in a week’s time, by the Gambling Commission of betting with respect to politics to see whether we need much clearer rules.” Kemi Badenoch has said she is “never going to shut up” about the “divisive agenda of diversity politics … no matter how many Doctor Whos” tell her to. Speaking at The British Chambers of Commerce annual conference, the business secretary said: “Identity politics is why Labour’s biggest change is to introduce a new Race Equality Act. In their manifesto they say that they will enshrine in law the full right to equal pay for ethnic minorities. But you know and I know we already have laws that do that, so this is going to be a much more political law.” Badenoch said the Race Equality Act proposed by the Labour Party would be “great for job creation for compliance consultants and employment tribunals” but this was “not the route to improving productivity or delivering real economic growth”. An adviser to President Zelensky has described Nigel Farage’s remarks on the Russian invasion of Ukraine as disgusting and short-sighted. Last week the Reform leader suggested Kyiv should start peace talks despite Moscow continuing to occupy territory mostly located in the east of the country. Otherwise, Farage added, “There may be no young men left in Ukraine”. Mykhailo Podolyak, who has represented his country at previous peace negotiations with Russia, said the comments were “extremely disgusting on moral grounds and extremely short-sighted on political grounds”. He told the BBC that such a move would “indulge the aggressor” and could make the situation worse because there is no certainty President Putin would stop if he got what he wanted. Farage said during the campaign today that Putin is a “very dangerous and evil man” but that expanding Nato and the EU over the past few decades had been a “mistake”. Sir Keir Starmer has defended the Labour Party’s plans to end the VAT exemption for private schools, telling Sophy Ridge on Sky News that “they will adapt” and “there is no evidence to show that these schools will close”. Starmer told Ridge that the decision to remove the VAT exemption was a “tough choice” and said he understood that “many parents work hard and save to send their children to private school”. “But every single parent has aspiration for their child, including every parent of a child in that state secondary school,” Starmer added. The removal of the VAT exemption was aimed at tackling the shortage of teachers for “core subjects” such as maths, Starmer said. “So we’ve got supply teachers teaching maths to young people in our state secondaries. That’s not on,” he said. Starmer claimed a “thousand private schools have closed” under the Conservatives. Rishi Sunak has said the polls “aren’t destiny” and claimed that 150,000 voters shifting their support from Labour to the Conservatives in key areas could make all the difference. Speaking to GB News, Sunak said: “I’d say to everyone watching, those polls aren’t destiny. People watching can make the difference.” Sunak admitted the Conservative Party “haven’t got everything right” but said this was an “important election about your future”. He warned about the risks of giving the Labour Party a “blank cheque” which he claimed would put people’s family finances at risk. Reform has dropped a candidate after it was revealed he had been on a list of members belonging to the British National Party. Raymond Saint’s name and address appeared on a list of BNP members that was published by WikiLeaks in 2009, The Guardian reported. The newspaper said Saint, who is standing in Basingstoke, did not wish to discuss the matter when they approached him. Reform said: “As Nigel Farage has repeatedly made plain, people who belong or used to belong to the BNP are not welcome in the Reform UK party. “Every candidate was asked to declare their past or present political affiliations and was specifically asked whether they had ever been a member of the BNP. Mr Saint failed to do so and clearly lied to us.” Rishi Sunak has visited a factory in Derby that is used to build trains for London’s Elizabeth Line. Meeting with staff and apprentices at Alstom’s plant, the prime minister told apprentices that they must “feel like you’re already getting ahead of the game” when he told them about plans to fund 100,000 apprenticeships if the Conservatives win the election. The factory is also being used to build 54 HS2 trains in a joint venture with Hitachi. The factory’s future was secured this month when a £370 million deal to build ten new Elizabeth Line trains was agreed. “I’m not sure there is a Tory party any more”, a former Conservative Party chairman has told Times Radio. Lord Patten said that Brexit and Boris Johnson were “two of the biggest errors in modern British politics”. The former chairman said he “would like to feel sympathy for the prime minister” but didn’t because he “was in favour of the biggest errors in modern British politics”. “I debated with him once saying that we shouldn’t have Boris Johnson as leader because he was a moral vacuum. Rishi Sunak was on the other side supporting him”, he added. Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton has warned about the possibility of artificial intelligence and deep fakes influencing politics after he received a fake video call from someone claiming to be Petro Poroshenko, a former Ukrainian president. The foreign secretary said he had met Poroshenko before and knew him well but that the fake was good enough to deceive him. “The quality of the deepfake was remarkable, I was convinced throughout the call and after this was the former President of Ukraine who I know very well, I’ve met him … it shows the quality of these things,” he told LBC. “If I go back to when I was PM, you did get hoax calls getting through, but you could tell straight away it wasn’t the person it was meant to be, or it didn’t sound like them, it didn’t look like them. The deep fake was so good, you had no idea it was a hoax.” The government made the hoax call public knowledge earlier this month. Cameron stopped responding to the person he was speaking to when they started asking for contact details. Three party leaders have tried their hand at pottery painting on the campaign trail.  Rishi Sunak was seen dipping a red and brown teapot into a tub of sky blue glaze at Denby Pottery before he toured the factory floor.  Georgia Plinston, a dipper, praised Sunak for covering the teapot relatively evenly and gave him an eight out of ten rating for his work.  Sir Ed Davey painted a bumble bee onto a piece of pottery in Hazel Grove, Stockport, and admitted he had been concerned about the bright colours while he was wearing a white shirt.  Sir Keir Starmer was also seen getting a pottery lesson and chatting about apprenticeships with the celebrity potter Keith Brymer Jones. Sir Keir Starmer faced a pro-Palestinian protest after his visit to a pottery factory in Staffordshire.  A group of men gathered outside and some accused the people leaving the building of being “child murderers”.  They said: “How can he run the country when he can’t face his people?” Rishi Sunak refused to “speculate on media commentary” about the betting scandal, amid BBC reports that 15 Conservative candidates and officials are being investigated.  The prime minister said that, beyond those already publicised, he is not aware of anyone else being subject to an investigation.  The Gambling Commission is leading an investigation into gambling on the general election, with the Met Police also investigating whether “a small number of bets” amount to misconduct in public office.  The force announced on Thursday that it was investigating seven of its own officers “so far”, while Sunak has already suspended two candidates who are part of the Gambling Commission inquiry.  Asked whether he had suspended any other party figures unknown to the public, Sunak said: “I’m not going to speculate on what media commentary is out there.  “What I can tell you is, if we are made aware of anything untoward by the Gambling Commission then we will conduct internal inquiries, as we have done, and take action as appropriate.” Sir Keir Starmer has said he is working on a “progressive response” in Europe amid a rise in popularity for far-right parties on the Continent.  But he said that if Marine Le Pen becomes the next French president it would not be “an inhibitor for a better set of working relations”.  Starmer added: “I don’t want to get ahead of myself, the election is next week … but yes, I do think that all progressives should work across Europe and beyond Europe, because I believe that the only response to some of the increasing challenges we see across Europe is a progressive response to that and therefore, I’m already working with others. I’m in touch with our sister parties.  “Obviously, where they’re in power, we talk a lot and when they’re not in power we also talk a lot and that will continue.” Rishi Sunak has repeatedly refused to say whether he told one of his closest parliamentary aides the date of the election before he placed a bet on it.  Speaking to broadcasters, the prime minister insisted that he was “furious” when he was first told about the allegations and he said: “If anyone is breaking the rules, they should face the full consequences of the law, whether that’s the Gambling Commission or the police.”  Craig Williams, who has been suspended as the Conservative candidate in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, admitted he “committed a serious error of judgement” but “not an offence”.  When Sunak was pressed on whether he told Williams the date of the election in advance, he refused to say.  “It’s absolutely not right when there are ongoing independent investigations, that those aren’t compromised in any way, shape or form, they are rightly confidential,” he said. Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour will not act as a “guarantor” for the “hundreds of billions” of pounds needed to deliver on its net zero plans.  Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the treasury, said that the plans would require that level of investment in a leaked recording from March.  Starmer said: “Governments don’t act as guarantors for private investors. What governments do is to create the conditions for private investors to come in alongside government and invest.  “But in relation to Darren Jones’ comments, he was talking about the investment we want to come alongside the money that we’re going to put in as a government, particularly on a green prosperity plan.” Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, has defended using the word “invasion” to describe the number of small boats coming across the Channel.  Speaking at a campaign rally in County Durham, Farage said: “If it’s not an invasion, what the hell is it?”  Farage credited himself with drawing attention to the issue of small boats when he started filming the English Channel in the spring of 2020.  He claimed that using the word “invasion” meant he was to be a “pariah for the rest of my life”.  Farage described Theresa May as “one of the most useless prime ministers of modern times” and argued the Brexit Party’s success in the European elections was responsible for getting rid of “the useless Mrs May”. Rishi Sunak has been heckled at an election question and answer session in Derbyshire.  Speaking before he was heckled, Sunak said: “If you want your taxes cut that is what I will deliver. The alternative is that they will just go up and that will make everything harder for you and I don’t want to see that happen.”  The heckler in the audience then told Sunak: “You need to tax the millionaires and billionaires, that would definitely help.”  Sunak claimed the proportion paid by the richest in income tax was at its highest level since 2010. Sir Keir Starmer repeated that he would open discussions with junior doctors on day one of a Labour government if he is elected on July 4.  The Labour leader said: “I don’t want these strikes to be going ahead.”  He added: “This is a problem the government has failed to deal with, and if we’re elected into government we will have to pick it up. What we will do is ensure on day one we start the discussion.” Sir Keir Starmer has said he is “surprised” by a poster released by the Conservatives warning voters of “surrender” to Labour.  The poster shows the backs of a family, including a young child, with their hands in the air with the message “don’t surrender your family’s future to Labour”.  Asked about the poster on a visit to a college in Staffordshire, Starmer said: “I think this is really desperate stuff and I’m surprised by it.  “I think it underlines the difference between the two campaigns now. They’re running a very negative campaign, nothing about the future of the country. I’m very happy to be the candidate going into the final week, who’s putting forward a positive case for the change the country needs. “The Conservatives are getting deeper and deeper into desperation now.” Sir Keir Starmer has insisted that the Labour Party is “fighting everywhere” and is “not backing down anywhere across the country”.  Following a report in The Guardian which suggested the Labour Party had given up in Clacton and encouraged their candidate Jovan Owusu-Nepaul to go quiet, Starmer said his party was continuing to deploy “our resources across the country, including in Clacton”.  “Yes we want to take the fight to the Tories and Reform wherever they are, we are not backing down in Clacton, we are not backing down anywhere across the country”, he added.  Sir John Hall, the former owner of Newcastle United, has publicly backed the Reform leader Nigel Farage. In the past, Hall has donated more than £500,000 to the Conservatives. However, he told journalists that he had become “disillusioned” and told the party to “get stuffed”. Nigel Farage said the election betting scandal had demonstrated “a sense of arrogance and entitlement from a Westminster-based Conservative Party”. He replied “absolutely not” when asked if he had bet on himself at this year’s general election. But he added: “I did bet on Brexit… I bet on Trump twice, I won one, I lost one. Whatever I do is open.” Farage also admitted that Reform candidates have said “things that I’d rather they’d not said”. Speaking about controversial remarks made by  candidates from his party , Farage said that “politics sometimes attracts people who are a bit rough around the edges”. Rishi Sunak admitted the Conservatives had made mistakes but said Sir Keir Starmer “changes his mind on almost every major position”. The prime minister, during a visit to a pottery factory in Derbyshire, said: “I understand why many of you might be hesitant about supporting us again at this election. “I’m not blind to the frustrations that you feel about me, about our party. It’s been a very difficult few years with Covid, the war in Ukraine, and we haven’t got everything right, we’ve made mistakes and we haven’t made as much progress in all areas as we would have liked. “But this is not a by-election. This is a choice about the future of our country … Before you make that choice, you should just think very hard about what a Labour government would actually mean for you.” A worker at the pottery plant asked Sunak why four more years of Conservative government would be an improvement on the previous 14. The worker said things had got “infinitely worse” since the Conservatives took office in 2010, with food bank use soaring. Sunak said there were “lots of frustrations that you, and others, will have about some things in the past. [But] this election is about the future. And if you care about financial security for families, that’s what I will deliver, because no one is going to be helped by their taxes going up.” Sir Keir Starmer has ruled out sending illegal immigrants back to Afghanistan or Iran after Rishi Sunak accused him of planning to “sit down with the ayatollahs” to negotiate return agreements. Asked whether he could rule out sending migrants back to Afghanistan, as the prime minister suggested in last night’s BBC debate, Starmer said: “There are some things that are not sensible for the asylum policy. That was a throwaway comment from the prime minister himself who had no answer to that question. “But leaving those claims unprocessed is not the answer to that. Of course there will be countries, Afghanistan for example, where you can’t return people — people who perhaps helped us by interpreting for our troops in Afghanistan and put themselves at risk; people who in my constituency were fleeing war in Afghanistan and found we weren’t able to get them out on those flights. “Of course, in relation to their particular cases, they’re not going to be returned to Afghanistan. But what we can’t do is stay with this absurd situation where there’s just a growing and growing number, to which the prime minister has got absolutely no answer.” The Labour leader also insisted he did not mean to offend British Bangladeshis after appearing to single out the nationality for deportation in a debate earlier in the week. The comments, in The Sun’s Never Mind the Ballots leaders’ special on Monday, have been widely distributed on WhatsApp groups in the Bangladeshi community and threaten to dent Labour’s support among voters already angry over the party’s position on Gaza. Starmer said: “In relation to Bangladesh, let me say just how much I value the relationship … that we have with the Bangladeshi community in Britain. They make a massive contribution to our economy to our culture and to our country. He added: “The reference in the debate the other day, was an example of a country that is considered safe as far as asylum concerns and one of the countries that actually has a returns agreement with us. I certainly wasn’t intending to cause any concern or offence to any Bangladeshi community here.” You should “vote with your heart” if you believe in Reform’s message, Nigel Farage has told voters during a visit to the northeast. Farage said that polls showed Reform was in second place to Labour in the region “What I’m saying to people here is … vote with your heart,” he said. The Reform leader said he feared that if Labour forms the next government then the “Brexit betrayal” would continue. “I’m very worried that the Brexit betrayal that we saw from the Conservatives over immigration is going to continue with Keir Starmer over rules and regulations,” he said. Farage also said the Conservative Party “will be in opposition but they won’t be the opposition” as “they’re too divided”. Seven police officers are now under investigation for betting on the general election date, the Met has confirmed.  The force said that “so far” seven officers had been found by comparing a list of officers with the names of those who have placed bets on the timing of the election.  Among these, a PC attached to the Royalty and Specialist Protection Command was arrested on Monday 17 June on suspicion of Misconduct in Public Office, but has since been bailed and is subject to restricted duties.  The Met is investigating “a small number of bets” as part of a joint investigation led by the Gambling Commission, but it said the majority of bets under investigation are suspected of cheating [being in breach of Section 42 of the Gambling Act 2005], rather than misconduct in public office.  The commission said it would not name any person under investigation “to protect the integrity of the investigation and to ensure a fair and just outcome”. Hugh Grant has endorsed the co-leader of the Green Party, Carla Denyer, to become the MP for the marginal seat of Bristol Central.  The latest polling has suggested the Bristol Central seat will go down to the wire and there is a high likelihood that Labour’s shadow culture secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, will lose the seat to Denyer.  The most recent YouGov Poll predicted the Green Party would win by a comfortable margin, with the Greens on 50 per cent compared with Labour on 37 per cent.  Grant has endorsed Denyer on Green Party leaflets, which have been distributed in the constituency. On the leaflet, Grant is quoted as saying: “It’s so refreshing to see a politician with integrity who puts the public first. Bristol Central would be very lucky to have Carla Denyer as its MP.” Grant’s endorsement comes after arts stars such as Bill Nighy, Hugh Bonneville, Keeley Hawes and Grayson Perry  wrote a letter to The Times endorsing the Labour Party . In the letter, it was said that “our country needs change”.  Steve Baker will launch a bid to become leader of the Conservative Party if he keeps hold of his seat, HuffPost UK has reported.  The Northern Ireland minister became the MP for Wycombe in 2010 and was re-elected with a 4,214 majority in 2019. However, YouGov’s most recent MRP poll  predicted the seat was a likely gain by the Labour Party .  Baker was critical of Rishi Sunak for the length of time he took to suspend the two Tory candidates who have been accused of allegedly betting on the general election date.  He  told ITV’s Peston programme : “If they placed bets, it is disreputable. I would call them up and ask them ‘did you do it’. If they did it, they’d be suspended.  “But the prime minister will have to answer why he hasn’t done it. I haven’t got inside information on why the prime minister hasn’t done it.” The Met Police is reportedly trying to investigate all cases of betting on the general election, a source from the Gambling Commission has claimed.  The force previously said it was probing whether a “small number of cases” amount to misconduct in public office, but a commission source has told Sky News that the Met wanted to lead the investigations into their own officers, as well as parliamentary candidates and officials.  The source told the outlet that if the Met took over, the politicians identified would be arrested under caution and may be interviewed with commission officials present. Labour will take a “the grown-up approach to Brexit that the government has lacked”, the shadow business secretary has said.  Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, said that the UK’s relationship with the European Union should be driven by “good faith and reason, not by the internal politics of the Conservative Party”.  He told the British Chambers of Commerce conference in London: “We know we can do better, and Labour will not be seeking to rejoin the single market or the customs union, or to reopen the wounds of the past because that wouldn’t give us the stability which we know is essential.  “We’re clear we need to get a better deal and there are real improvements, we could achieve.” Labour is not pitching “a new Netflix series” or trying to be “entertainment”, the shadow business secretary has said, in defence of the party’s campaign.  Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, told a British Chambers of Commerce conference in London: “I’m told by some commentators, they don’t think Labour’s campaign is exciting enough.  “We’re not pitching you a new Netflix series. We’re not putting on politics as entertainment.  “We want to return to serious government, to effective policy and to politics as public service, not as pantomime.” The Labour Party is set to be the largest party in Scotland, with polling by Savanta forecasting the party to pick up 28 seats.  In the 2019 general election, the Labour Party only won one seat, whereas the Scottish National Party won 48.  Professor Sir John Curtice has said that despite polling by Savanta showing both the SNP and Labour on 34 per cent, this could still mean Labour wins 28 seats and the SNP is reduced to 18 from 48.  Emma Levin, the associate director at Savanta said: “Our latest Scottish voting intention suggests that the gap between Labour and the SNP is closing in Scotland, although this would still mean Labour picking up 28 Scottish MPs and the SNP dropping to 18.”  Levin said the Labour Party’s vote looked “more efficient” and this was due to much of it being “concentrated around the central belt”. A Labour member arrested over the Westminster honeytrap investigation has been released from custody.  The man in his mid-20s, who has not been named by police, was released on bail until late September, according to Scotland Yard.  In a statement,  the Met said the arrest  related to an “investigation being carried out by the Met’s Parliamentary Liaison and Investigation Team following reports of unsolicited messages sent to MPs and others”. It added: “The investigation remains ongoing.” Half of Britons blame the government for industrial action and support the junior doctors strike, a poll has found.  Support for junior doctors has risen to 52 per cent in a survey by Ipsos published today, up from 46 per cent in May.  As a five-day BMA strike begins today, a week before the general election, 50 per cent also said they blame the government for the strikes, with three in five believing Sunak’s administration is doing a bad job in negotiating an end to the action.  Over a quarter [26 per cent] said both the government and the doctors were to blame for the strikes and 16 per cent blame the junior doctors alone.  Only 39 per cent of those surveyed thought Labour would handle negotiations better, with 33 per cent saying the party would make no difference and 18 per cent saying industrial action would worsen under Labour. Georgia’s shock win over Portugal on ITV was watched by more viewers than the head-to-head between Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer on the BBC.  The Euros game on ITV, which saw the underdogs Georgia triumph over Portugal, was watched by an average of 4.2 million viewers and this peaked at 6.4 million viewers.  In comparison, the BBC debate peaked at three million viewers and was watched by an average of 2.7 million viewers. Strong regulation is needed to stabilise the university sector, Labour’s shadow education secretary has said, but she did not commit to new spending.  Bridget Phillipson was asked on BBC Radio 4 why there is no spending commitment for universities in Labour’s manifesto, as the Office for Students warned four in ten universities are going into deficit this year.  She said the next government will have to “stabilise” the sector with “strong regulation” to ensure universities are treated as “engines of growth” but did not commit to new spending. Junior doctor strikes will continue if Starmer “wants to continue lying” like the current government, a health union chair has said.  In an interview with Sky News, Dr Rob Laurenson, the co-chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) junior doctors committee, called on Sunak to “sit down, drop the rhetoric, talk about pay”, as junior doctors start a five-day strike, their 11th industrial action by the BMA in the ongoing pay dispute.  He claimed junior doctors are currently paid £15 an hour, which he wants to increase to £21 an hour.  Laurenson said: “Rishi Sunak’s made a big point about making clear plans and giving bold action. But the truth of the matter is he has no plan.”  He added:”The government has spent £3bn on strikes, and pay restoration costs £1.3bn.  “So if an incoming government under Keir Starmer wants to continue lying, then it looks like strikes will have to continue as well.” Sir Ed Davey said there is an “overwhelming” case for banishing cigarettes but supports a regulated legal cannabis market.  The Liberal Democrat leader told BBC Radio 5 Live that he does not oppose people having nicotine in vapes but wants “much less potent” cannabis products available.  He said: “All we’re trying to do is have evidence-based health policies, whether it’s in this area or in other areas. I think what is incumbent on politicians and the government is to listen to people who’ve done all the research and got all the evidence.  “There are communities in our country which are extremely harmed by drug gangs… We’ve got to really crack down on them. If you took our approach, which is working in a lot of countries, you’d free up police resources to go after real criminals, the drug barons.”  Davey said he had smoked cannabis “very seldom” on “a few occasions” at university. Scottish Parliament is preparing for the final First Minister’s Questions before the summer recess today.  The 45-minute session comes amid pressure on the secretary of state for Scotland to provide “full details” about an alleged bet on a July general election. It was claimed Alister Jack won £2,000 but he has insisted the  comments he made to the BBC were a joke .  All leaders will then resume the campaign trail, with both the first minister John Swinney, (of the SNP) and Anas Sarwar (of Labour) making health-related visits.  Douglas Ross (of the Scottish Conservatives) will be at a distillery in East Lothian, while Alex Cole-Hamilton (of the Scottish Lib Dems) will visit a tech centre in Edinburgh to emphasise the need for better broadband. Jeremy Hunt has donated a further £32,000 to his local constituency party in an attempt to avoid becoming the first sitting chancellor in modern British history to lose his seat.  New figures from the electoral commission show Hunt made three donations, totalling to £32,245, which were received by Godalming and Ash Conservatives in the first quarter of this year.  MPs and candidates can donate to their local constituency accounting unit under electoral rules. Hunt has donated over £166,457.01 to his since 2014.  The Liberal Democrats, who are predicted to take the Surrey seat next week, called the contest “neck and neck”.  A source told Sky News: “There’s no doubt that Jeremy Hunt needs all the help he can get — that’s why he is throwing the kitchen sink at keeping his seat.” Tory candidates and activists have been urged not to give up, despite the polls still showing the party is on course for one of its worst defeats in decades.  Kevin Hollinrake told  Times Radio  he understood the “mood for change” across the country, but said: “I’m always optimistic. Victory is always possible if you don’t stop fighting.”  He added: “We’ve got to fight for every single vote, every single seat. That’s absolutely what we should do.” Labour will seek to renegotiate the Brexit deal with Brussels to eliminate “red tape” that has “opened up” since 2021.  Bridget Phillipson said businesses have some frustrations with increased regulation and vowed to push for a better deal than Boris Johnson struck.  Post-EU arrangements have been in place since the transition period ended on 31 December 2020. A review is built into the deal, which will happen in 2026.  However, Labour’s shadow education secretary said the party would have “clear red lines” — including no return to freedom of movement, the single market or customs union. Nadhim Zahawi posted a [cryptic] message about the heroism of surrendering yourself “to save [your] comrades” in relation to a historical artwork.  The former chancellor, who is standing down as an MP at the general election, shared a photo of the painting, titled                     A very gallant gentleman                     by John Charles Dollman on X/Twitter last night.  Zahawi wrote: “True heroism. Captain Oates taking himself out, walking to his death to save his comrades.”  The artwork depicts the polar explorer Captain Lawrence Oates, who walked into a blizzard to sacrifice himself during the Terra Nova Expedition as his gangrene and frostbite was hindering his companions’ chance of survival.  Zahawi was sacked as Conservative Party chairman last January after an inquiry found he had failed to disclose that HMRC was investigating his tax affairs. Businesses should provide toilets with a “range of options” to ensure women get access to female-only spaces, a Labour frontbencher has said.  Bridget Phillipson promised that a Keir Starmer-Labour government would “maintain” provisions in the law that allow women access to single-sex spaces and services.  She said she had run a women’s refuge before going into politics, and understood the importance of supporting biologically-born women. Phillipson added it was right for trans women to have appropriate care and support, but added: “That would be done on a different basis.”  Asked whether pre-op trans women could use a women’s toilet if they had a gender recognition certificate, Phillipson said businesses should have “a range of options available” so everyone’s privacy and dignity is maintained, such as single cubicles. Ideally “zero” migrants would be sent to Rwanda if the flights act as a deterrent, a minister has said.  Asked on  Times Radio  this morning how many people could be sent to Rwanda within the first year of flights, Kevin Hollinrake, the business minister, said: “Well, potentially thousands, because it’s a completely scalable solution. But the ideal number of people that go to Rwanda is zero. Because it’ll stop people coming in the first place.”  He added that migrants were still crossing the channel by boat as the legislation is not yet properly in effect.  “Detention works today. The removal to Rwanda doesn’t work yet because Labour have opposed it 130 times. When that legislation is in effect, that’s the effect you will see. It’s worked in other countries. It worked in Australia. This is what we believe is the right way to deal with this.” David Tennant has been criticised by a Labour frontbencher for comments about Kemi Badenoch that were not “tolerant and respectful”.  Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said: “I personally don’t like that kind of language that was used.”  She hit out at Tennant for saying he wanted a world where Badenoch, the equalities minister, “doesn’t exist anymore” and should “shut up”.  Phillipson said any debate on how to balance rights of women and trans people should be respectful, but added of  Tennant’s comment : “I don’t think it advanced a more tolerant and respectful discussion.” The Met Police has announced it will investigate certain allegations of betting on the general election, probing whether a “small number of cases” amount to misconduct in public office.  A spokesman said: “The Met is not taking over the investigation into bets on the timing of the general election.  “The Gambling Commission will continue to lead the investigation into cases where the alleged offending is limited to breaches of the Gambling Act only.  “Met detectives will lead on investigating a small number of cases to assess whether the alleged offending goes beyond Gambling Act offences to include others, such as misconduct in public office.” The timing of the latest junior doctors’ strike one week before the general election was “interesting”, a minister has said.  Kevin Hollinrake, the business minister, told Sky News: “It’s interesting timing, it really is. There’s not been a strike for some time.  “I don’t know, I’m not going to judge somebody’s motivation for a decision but it’s interesting timing and I regret the decision to strike because we know this doesn’t help waiting lists, which we want to bring down.” Kevin Hollinrake, the business minister, told  Times Radio  that he had put a bet on the Conservatives to win the election but gambling on the result of his own constituency would be “wrong”.  The MP for Thirsk and Malton was asked if he had placed a bet on the Conservatives winning the general election.  “Yes, I did. Not my seat, I think that would be wrong,” he said, adding: “This situation has definitely opened up a debate that we should have a proper debate about and decide whether it’s right or wrong that people have a bet on things they are involved in.” Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer are back on their battle buses across the country as the campaign enters the final week.  Labour maintains its lead, standing at 42 points in the most recent Ipsos poll.  The Conservative Party stood at 19 percentage points, having lost four points since the previous poll.  Support had risen for Reform UK to 15 points and for the Liberal Democrats to 11 points. The Green Party stood at 7 per cent, in the poll of 1,402 adults conducted from June 21 to 24. The Conservative campaign’s “mistakes” have been an “unwelcome distraction”, a minister has admitted.  Kevin Hollinrake, the business minister, said he “gets the mood for a change in this country” but urged voters who believe a Labour victory is inevitable: “Don’t surrender to that.”  Quizzed on “mistakes” made during the Tory election campaign, he said voters were focused on solving issues such as taxes and migration. “Anything that clouds that decision is of course an unwelcome distraction.” The prospect of banning MPs from placing bets on politics has been mooted by a minister.  Kevin Hollinrake, the business minister, was asked on Sky News if politicians should be treated like sportspeople — who are not allowed to gamble on fixtures or leagues they or their team are involved in.  Hollinrake said: “I think we should have a debate about it. I’m not against a ban on politicians betting on politics.” Junior doctors in England have started a five-day strike, due to end two days before the general election.  The British Medical Association (BMA) is calling for a 35 per cent pay increase, claiming doctors’ pay has been cut by more than a quarter over the last 15 years.  The doctors have said Wes Streeting, Labour’s shadow health secretary,  has promised negotiations  on July 5 if the party wins the general election, although Streeting has said he will not meet the 35 per cent demand.  Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, said it would not be appropriate to make an offer during the pre-election period. It is hard to think that any fair-minded observer won’t have called the night as anything other than a thumping win for Rishi Sunak.  He was furiously articulate. He’s simply the better debater, but he also knows that the voters are long past caring.                    Read                    Tom Peck’s analysis Three weeks ago when Rishi Sunak and  Sir Keir Starmer  first faced each other across a television studio the prime minister saw it as his last chance to turn the tide of the election.  That hope is now gone. Instead  Sunak ’s task is more about damage limitation. With Labour retaining its 20-point lead in the polls and Reform eating into the Tory vote, in this debate the prime minister had nothing to lose. And it showed.                     Read                    Oliver Wright and Steven Swinford’s analysis Rishi Sunak warned voters not to “surrender” to Labour as Sir Keir Starmer branded him “Liz Truss mark two” during an acrimonious head-to-head debate (Steven Swinford and Oliver Wright write). With the polls showing the Tories heading for a landslide defeat, the prime minister, in a barnstorming mood, used the BBC1 showdown to ­accuse Starmer repeatedly of plotting to raise taxes if he won the election next week. “Keir Starmer and the Labour Party are not being straight with you, so do not surrender to their tax rises,” he said. “Family finances are going to get ­hammered, taxes are going to get whacked up.”                    Read more:                    Rishi Sunak rams home tax message in final election debate Rishi Sunak will be in the Midlands and Yorkshire, visiting a pottery factory in Derbyshire and making a short speech in Leeds later. Sir Keir Starmer will join Labour’s campaign bus in the northwest and West Midlands, stopping in Staffordshire and Cheshire, as the party outlines its plans to break down barriers to opportunity for young people by boosting career advice. Sir Ed Davey  will start his day with the morning media round before visiting Hazel Grove in North Shropshire, while  Nigel Farage  is due to speak in Houghton-le-Spring near Sunderland.
