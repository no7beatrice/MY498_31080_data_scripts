   European judges to rule over Gibraltar: Brexit deal will mean the Rock would have to follow EU rules to appease Spain, UK ministers admit MailOnline May 2, 2024 Thursday 8:20 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 893 words Byline: Elena Salvoni Body   UK minister for Gibraltar emphasised that defending sovereignty was a 'red line' European judges could rule on disputes involving Gibralatar and the Rock territory under a new Brexit deal, ministers have admitted. The Rock territory will also have to follow some EU rules under the agreement, in order to secure a more open border with Spain, the Foreign Office said.                      Tory MPs have expressed 'considerable alarm' over the concessions the UK has agreed to, and questioned whether British sovereignty of the territory might be compromised as a result of the deal. UK minister for Gibraltar, David Rutley, emphasised to the Commons European Scrutiny Committee that defending the sovereignty of Gibraltar was a 'red line'.  The concerns have been raised as Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron is leading talks with the EU in a bid to secure a deal and end the post-Brexit impasse, with officials announcing last month that the 'core elements' of the pact had been agreed upon. Britain has been locked in talks over Gibraltar's future since it left the European Union in 2016, ending freedom of movement between Spain and the territory. The sovereignty of the territory, which was ceded to the British from Spain in 1713, remains a source of tension between the UK and Spain. Its inhabitants voted twice to reject Spanish sovereignty in 1967 and 2002. In 2016 they voted overwhelmingly (96%) to stay in the European Union. Madrid continues to claim sovereignty over the spit of land, which is located on the southern end of the Iberian peninsula. It is pushing for a treaty over the territory's post-Brexit future before crunch European parliament elections on June 6. But pressure from Tory MPs has been mounting after a Foreign Office civil servant involved in the negotiations admitted that concessions include European Court of Justice (ECJ) having influence there. He told MPs at the Commons European Scrutiny Committee that while the Luxembourg-based court would not enforce the 'direct application' of EU rules on the Rock there could be cases 'where there may be [a] referral'. The chairman of the committee, Sir Bill Cash, said that its role was focused on its sovereignty. 'I sincerely trust that the Government and the Foreign Secretary are well aware of the fact that any expansion or indirect application of the ECJ's jurisdiction to matters relating to these issues will be regarded as a very, very serious matter,' he cautioned. David Jones, a former Brexit minister, 'We're talking about, it seems to me, a significant diminution of British sovereignty that the Government is quite happy, apparently, to play along with.' Mr Rutley told the committee that Gibraltar's government was happy with the proposed deal and wanted it to be completed.

'These are effectively our red lines, they have been from the start. We're not going to do a deal that isn't the right deal.' In theory, Gibraltar - home to more than 32,000 people - is currently outside the EU's customs union and not under free movement rules. However, Madrid has granted a temporary exemption for workers and tourists to avoid disruption on the narrow peninsula that jets off Spain's southern coast - leaving the overseas territory in a state of limbo since Brexit. The temporary agreement could be rescinded by Spain at any time, and so the negotiations are working towards agreeing common travel between Gibraltar and the EU's Schengen zone, which would remove most border controls. The latest wrangling comes after a top EU commissioner was accused of 'grandstanding' by the former head of Britain's Royal Navy after he said that 'Gibraltar is Spanish'. Margaritis Schinas, a vice-president of the European Commission, made the comments at a briefing in Seville last month. They have already been rebuked as 'incomprehensible' by Spain's foreign minister, José Manuel Albares.                      Britain and Spain's Gibraltar dispute: Centuries of painful conflict                     The sovereignty of Gibraltar is a major source of tension between the UK and Spain. Both in 1967 and 2002, the people of Gibraltar rejected proposals for Spanish sovereignty. Yet, despite this, Spain still asserts a claim to the territory. The tension began in 1704 when an Anglo-Dutch force captured Gibraltar from Spain during the war of the Spanish succession. The territory was then ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Historically, it has proved to be an important base for the Royal Navy. Now, its economy is based on tourism, financial services and shipping. Under the 2006 constitution of Gibraltar, the territory governs its own affairs although defence and foreign relations are still the responsibility of the UK Government. Located on the southern end of the Iberian Peninsula, it is an area of 6.8 square kilometres (less than three square miles). Load-Date: May 2, 2024  End of Document
