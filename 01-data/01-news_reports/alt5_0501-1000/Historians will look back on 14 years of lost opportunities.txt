   Historians will look back on 14 years of lost opportunities thetimes.co.uk May 24, 2024 Friday 4:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 2641 words Byline: Anthony Seldon Highlight: Since 2010, five Conservative prime ministers have notched up some modest successes. But measured against four other periods of one-party dominance, the record is distinctly underwhelming, argues Anthony Seldon Body   The election on July 4 will be fought not just on the record of the 21-month Rishi Sunak premiership, nor of the 55 months since the December 2019 general election, but on the whole 14 years since the fall of Gordon Brown in May 2010. How does the Conservative record weigh against the earlier four periods of one-party dominance? The Conservatives were in office for 13 years from 1951 to 1964 under four prime ministers — Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home. Labour after 1964 were in power for 11 years under two prime ministers, Harold Wilson and James Callaghan (embracing the nearly four years of the Tories under Ted Heath). The Conservatives were back in office under Margaret Thatcher and John Major for 18 years from 1979 to 1997. Finally, Labour held power under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown for 13 years from 1997 to 2010. Several years in office is vital if governments are to make a difference. The 14 years since 2010 is a prolonged period to embed enduring change, far outstripping the length of two of the great reforming administrations of the last century, the Liberals in 1905-15 and Labour in 1945-51, the benchmarks against which all other governments can be judged on changing the agenda. Who will win the UK general election 2024? Latest poll tracker The two best comparators, though, for gaining a perspective on these past 14 years are the two previous periods of Conservative rule. The years after 1951 were labelled “13 wasted years” by Labour: even if unfair, the party failed to modernise the economy and improve productivity in step with competitors abroad. Dubbed “the stagnant society” by the author Michael Shanks, Britain under the Tories was seen as backward looking with polarised labour relations, which Wilson promised to blitz away with his “white heat of technology” revolution. From 1979, Britain’s economy, self-confidence and place in the world were transformed under Thatcher, with her legacy embedded by John Major, whose achievement for years remained under-recognised. The Conservatives since 2010 clearly achieved less than under Thatcher/Major: but did they outshine the performance of 1951-64? And if not, do these years deserve the moniker “14 wasted years?” One obvious difference is that, compared with the handsome majorities of both earlier periods, the Conservatives since 2010 had a much tougher time with their parliamentary arithmetic. In coalition with the Lib Dems for five years to 2015, they then lost their effective majority between 2017-19. Only in the past five years from 2019 were they in possession of a working majority. Let’s see how they performed in key policy areas. It’s hard to see the economic record since 2010 as anything but unimpressive, not least in comparison with the immediate Labour predecessor of 1997–2010. Inconsistent policy under seven chancellors (compared to only two under Labour, Brown and  Alistair Darling ) didn’t help. Nor did fraught relations between the prime minister and chancellor from 2016–22 (Theresa May with Philip Hammond, then  Boris Johnson  with Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak). Other countries of course experienced sluggish growth after the global financial crisis of 2007–08. But the Cameron/Osborne policy of austerity from 2010, with its largest and longest-enduring cuts in public spending since 1945, acted as a suppressant. By the time Liz Truss became prime minister in 2022, Britain was plagued by astronomic levels of debt, the highest taxes since the Second World War and steeply rising interest rates on top of the inflation. Jeremy Hunt steadied the ship as chancellor from October 2022 after the Truss/Kwarteng growth plan blew up, and the economic outlook has recently been more promising, with inflation falling this week to 2.3 per cent. But the economy is a pale shadow of the strength that Major and Ken Clarke bequeathed Labour in 1997. “Levelling up” was one of several economic initiatives that came to little. The northern branches of HS2, after 13 years of legislation and infrastructure development, were summarily scrapped by Sunak in October 2023. Health, and arguably income, inequality grew during the 14 years while public services became weaker, life expectancy improvement stalled and mental health problems, not least for the least well off, rose alarmingly. The public sphere, including libraries, playing fields and green spaces, declined. The public felt less safe from crime while the backlog of severe criminal cases waiting to be heard did nothing to reassure them. Immigration policy consistently failed to meet its objectives, the stalled Rwanda policy emblematic of a total policy failure. The party that has always prided itself on law and order, and had a series of hardline home secretaries in May, Priti Patel and Suella Braverman, struggled to uphold that reputation. The record on social policy is better, if uneven. Education is the one highlight, with the early running made by Michael Gove in 2010–14. Exam results improved, the curriculum was refined, synthetic phonics championed by the minister of state Nick Gibb, and Britain’s international position in maths and reading improved, though further and higher education, and preparation of the young for work, fared less well. In contrast, the Conservatives leave the NHS in 2024 in a perilous state amid strikes, loss of confidence and low morale, a sharp contrast to the institution it inherited in 2010. Social care, despite several attempts to provide lasting solutions, was left unresolved. Housing was one of several areas where there was an urgent need for strong and consistent policy, in this case new home building, which was not sustained. In foreign and domestic policy, it is difficult to argue that Britain is in a stronger position in the world in 2024 than it had been in 2010. The centrepoint of course is Brexit: David Cameron was unable to silence the fervent clamour from Ukip and other anti-EU voices. The narrow victory for Brexit in the June 2016 referendum put paid to him, and years of debilitating civil war followed, chewing up vast amounts of energy and time. After January 2020 when the UK formally left the EU, its closest trading partner for nearly 50 years, the shift to “global Britain” barely translated from aspiration into substance. Having made Brexit happen, the Conservatives conspicuously failed to drive home the economic and diplomatic benefits of standing alone in the world. Britain’s staple ally for 70 years, the United States, edged away after Brexit, new trading arrangements failed to materialise, while Britain’s standing in Europe, and its economy, suffered. The Conservatives’ main stand in the post-Brexit years was in the Russo-Ukrainian war from February 2022. Two years on, Britain is a minor player, as it is in the war in Gaza, for all the lustre that Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton has brought to the job of foreign secretary from last November. Nor is it easy to argue that the Union is stronger in 2024 than it had been in 2010, despite the defeat of the Scottish National Party in the independence referendum in 2014, and its collapse as a party in the past few years. Brexit caused great strains to one of Blair’s signature achievements, the Good Friday agreement, which built on Major’s work in bringing peace to Northern Ireland, and taking terrorism off the streets of mainland Britain. Sunak’s  Windsor Accord  in February 2023 went some way to tackle the difficulties that Johnson had bequeathed in his Northern Ireland protocol. But the Union still hangs together on a perilous thread, not helped by the loss during these years of its greatest force for cohesion, Elizabeth II in September 2022. There have been successes since 2010: aside from education, the national living wage, universal credit (as a policy if not implementation), the vaccine programme and rollout during the Covid pandemic, climate change policy not least at Cop26 in 2021, and a host of science innovations including the Advanced Research and Invention Agency and AI initiatives in education beyond. But the pot is not large, and is eclipsed by disappointments. What then might explain the relatively underwhelming record? We must start by appreciating the factors that historically have made for the most effective periods of one-party domination — above all a clear strategic direction driven by strong leadership from the top, a party willing to unite behind that leadership, and consistent policy execution across Whitehall departments. These were almost wholly lacking, despite the Conservatives benefiting from a weak and divided Labour Party, especially under Jeremy Corbyn (2015-20). Sir Keir Starmer has provided an increasingly strong challenge since, but he has not been a patch on the leadership and damage inflicted on the Tories by Wilson from 1963 or Blair from 1994. Strategic direction was lacking after 2010. True, the earlier periods saw ideological inconsistencies, from the laissez faire of Churchill to the paternalism of Macmillan, the small state of Thatcher to the limited intervention of Major. But nothing approached the crazy salad of these 14 years, from Cameron’s hopes for a “big society”, May’s war on “burning injustices”, Johnson’s “levelling up”, to Truss’s gang-buster growth revolution and Sunak’s managerialism. General election manifestos, which might have provided some coherence, were often quietly (or noisily) discarded. The 2010 “coalition agreement” between Cameron and Nick Clegg overtook many of the Tories’ manifesto commitments. The 2015 manifesto offered a clear direction but was shelved when May took over a year later after Cameron’s fall. Her own hopes for her tightly-guarded 2017 manifesto were sidelined after the loss of the majority and succession of Johnson. The 2019 manifesto deliberately avoided all detail and failed to provide any kind of roadmap for the zigzag years ahead. The watering down of manifesto content from 2017 revealed a pivot to tribal rather than governmental thinking. The five prime ministers all had qualities. Cameron was the best equipped, and was just getting going, free at last of the coalition with his own majority won in 2015 when he fell on his sword in summer 2016. May had integrity to her fingertips, but could not master a party fixated on putting ideology above consensus over Brexit. Johnson in No 10 forgot the qualities that made him a good mayor of London and squandered needlessly the Conservatives’ most promising moment, the 2019 general election victory with a majority of 80 when the country craved strong leadership. This was the biggest single missed opportunity of these 14 years. Truss had many of the right ideas on growth and all the wrong ideas about how to implement them, while Sunak, the youngest prime minister for 200 years, had brains and integrity in abundance but needed more experience and wisdom if he was to negotiate the frothing waters of late one-party rule. One can only ponder if those who never made it to No 10 might have been better: Osborne, Gove, Hunt and Ben Wallace, to say nothing of the ever-popular Penny Mordaunt, who came within five MPs’ votes of beating Truss to the final stage of the leadership contest in July 2022, where she would surely have trounced Sunak in the vote of party members and become prime minister. Party division, not helped by some terrible party management and shockingly entitled — even by tail-end Tory government standards — individual conduct by Conservative MPs damaged strategic clarity. Not since the party was founded in the early 19th century have the Conservatives been as divided as they have been since 2010. Do they believe in the free market or interventionism? In a big or small state? Welcoming or deploring immigration? Celebrating or trashing national institutions? Playing a full part in a multilateral world or acting alone, as it did in the 19th century? Protecting the environment and green belt or letting the economy rip? If Sunak does win on July 4, he will surely be engulfed by these contradictions, which only a prolonged period in opposition is likely to resolve. Ministerial quality was not a patch on the 1979–97 Tories, with departmental titans like Peter Carrington, Geoffrey Howe, Nigel Lawson, Norman Tebbit, Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten and Ken Clarke. Several stood out in their departments after 2010, including Hague, Osborne, Hammond, Gove, Hunt and Amber Rudd. But most ministers had never run anything before taking over giant departments: frankly, it showed. All ministers from the PM downwards require time in office to prove themselves. Yet these years saw churn at unprecedented levels. Five prime ministers served on average less than three years each. There were seven transport, nine business, nine work and pensions, ten education, and 12 media/digital secretaries. This is nonsense, and inconsistent and incomplete policy-making was the inevitable result. Furious Tories turned their sights on the blob, as it was termed, to blame for the poor performance. Never have the Conservatives attacked in such a consistent way the civil service, the judiciary, the Bank of England, the BBC and universities. Denunciation without reform generates poor morale and confusion, which is what happened. The centre of government was in need of dramatic reform for sure, and grievously missed the departure of cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood who died in 2018, aged 56. The office of the prime minister, and its relations with the Treasury, need attention, and the centre of government needs slimming down and strengthening, as the Institute for Government report                     Power with Purpose                     argued this year. It didn’t deserve aimless trashing. External shocks did not help any of the five prime ministers, including the legacy of the global financial crisis, Covid and the invasion of Ukraine with its devastating impact on fuel prices. But the earlier governments had shocks too, including the Suez crisis of 1956, adroitly calmed by the incoming prime minister Harold Macmillan. Thatcher’s handling of the Falklands conflict and end of the Cold War and Major’s resetting of economic policy with the chancellor Norman Lamont after Black Wednesday in 1992, when Britain was ejected from the European exchange rate mechanism, were confidently handled. The biggest shock of all in 2010-24 was entirely self-imposed: Brexit. The criticism of historians is likely to focus less on the decisions that led to it than on the lack of leadership that followed and the failure to capitalise on the opportunities that Brexit presented. Every disruption, as every great leader knows, creates unprecedented opportunities. The Conservatives had not only Brexit but also Covid, but such moments have to be channelled, and they conspicuously were not. The 14 years of Conservative rule have not been altogether wasted. There were plenty of examples of effective and high-quality leadership, rarely more so than at the Queen’s funeral, masterminded indicatively not by the nation’s politicians but by its much-criticised civil servants. But with the long lens of history, these 14 years will be seen as a time when opportunities for national renewal, cohesion and purpose were lost. So not wasted, but prodigal. Whether Labour, if they win, will be able to provide the quality of leadership demanded is the question. The country still has not found a settled place domestically or in the world at large this century. Starmer will need to emulate the ambition and achievement of Attlee — or of Wilson, Blair and Brown at their best — if he is to provide the strategic leadership needed.
