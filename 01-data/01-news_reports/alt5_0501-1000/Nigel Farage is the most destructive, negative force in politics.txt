   Nigel Farage is the most destructive, negative force in politics thetimes.co.uk June 15, 2024 Saturday 11:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 542 words Byline: Sir Christopher Gent Highlight: It is essential that right-of-centre voters unite to ensure his planned takeover of the Conservatives fails Body   As a lifelong member and supporter of the Conservative Party who joined in 1963, in part because it was then the party of Europe, I am dismayed by the potential impact that Nigel Farage and his Reform Party will have on the right-of-centre vote in the upcoming election. Farage is the most destructive and negative force in both British and European politics. He did much to engineer the Brexit decision in the referendum, which has inflicted short-term economic pain on the UK and pleased nobody better than Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, both of whom Farage so much admires. When I was involved in business, I and my colleagues in Vodafone saw Europe as a tremendous opportunity as we led the charge, introducing vigorous competition and, from that springboard, expanded to other global opportunities. At the heart of this was an economic interdependency which offered great business potential for mobile communications and wealth creation. Farage peddled an illusion that leaving Europe would give us growth, sovereignty and control of our borders. This ignored the fact that the UK is a trading nation with both its business and financial systems enmeshed in the international markets. Brexit has imposed both barriers to trade and increased our vulnerability to financial markets. It also undermined London’s position as a financial centre as more of this activity moves to Frankfurt, Paris and the US. Both Britain and our European allies have been damaged by Brexit. Now  Farage , who owns Reform as a company, seeks to destroy the Conservative Party as a prelude to  taking over what is left . This makes no economic sense, but neither did his pitch on Europe. He sold Brexit on a false prospectus. He is now offering right-of-centre voters a similar illusion. The outcome will be damaging for the Conservative Party and to wider politics as a new and inexperienced Labour government will need a robust opposition to keep it focussed on the nation’s interests. The Conservative Party has always been a broad alliance of views but with a common theme of support for wealth creation, property ownership, the rule of law and tolerance, and internationalist in outlook. If it veered off to the right, it would struggle to achieve credibility and regain power. I still work for the party but, if the polls are to be believed, it seems that the electorate are no longer listening to the Conservatives. This, despite the good work that Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt have done to cope with the challenges of Brexit, compounded by Covid, Putin’s war — with its impact on energy and food costs — and the brief turmoil of Liz Truss as our prime minster, all of which caused a squeeze on the cost of living. It is not surprising that the government of the day gets blamed. However, this is no reason for right-of-centre voters to ignore harsh realities or to believe the dangerous false promises of Farage. I hope that the electors of Clacton see through this plausible popularist. It is essential that his planned takeover of the party fails and vital that right-of-centre voters unite behind the Conservatives at this election to avoid disaster.
