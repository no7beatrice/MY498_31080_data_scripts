The measure would benefit millions of young people in the midst of their training who have seen their opportunities to travel, study or work between countries through which, until Brexit, they moved without hindrance greatly reduced and hindered. "The more young people move across the two sides of the Channel, the more we will increase the possibility and the probability that we can maintain good friendly relations in the future, because the next generation will know each other very well and will work together very well too," the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has assessed at a press conference. The idea is to "rebuild human bridges between young Europeans on both sides of the Channel," said European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic, announcing the proposal. According to the Commission's proposal, mobility would be facilitated for British and EU young people between the ages of 18 and 30, who would be allowed to stay for up to four years in the chosen country, without being obliged to set criteria for this mobility. In other words, the Commission stresses, the beneficiaries, who would not be subject to entry quotas, "should be able to carry out different activities during that period, such as studying, doing work experience, working or traveling." "The UK's exit from the EU has hit young people in the Union and Britons who want to study, work and live abroad particularly hard," recalled Sefcovic, who is responsible for the EU's relations with London after Brexit. With the new proposal from Brussels, "we take the first step towards an ambitious but realistic agreement that would settle this issue," the Slovak welcomed. What the European Executive proposes to the leaders of the Twenty-seven is not to open completely the free movement after the Brexit not even for the young people, but to create conditions simple and fluid enough to incite the vital exchanges for the formation of the new generations. And also, although this is not explicitly stated by Brussels beyond the mention of "human bridges", it seeks to see if it is possible to breathe some of the European spirit back into the Britons of the future. Europe has always relied on young people to foster it (a good example is the success of the Erasmus exchange program) and is aware that if there is a way to one day rekindle the Community flame on the other side of the Channel, its younger population is one of the best breeding grounds. Indeed, in announcing the mobility initiative, Brussels says it is open to having a "parallel discussion on a possible UK association to the Erasmus+ program." Brussels believes that London has shown interest in the matter, having already contacted, it says, some member states individually to address the issue of youth mobility. "With this proposal, the Commission seeks to respond to this issue of shared concern at EU-wide level," the Commission explains. For Von der Leyen, since the Windsor framework agreement was concluded just over a year ago now to close the most serious problems arising from the Northern Ireland Protocol, the last major outstanding Brexit fringe, the relationship has been "much more constructive", or that allows us to think about steps of rapprochement such as that of youth mobility. "We know we share values and look at today's challenges with the same angle, so it was clear from the Windsor agreement that we want to work together as much as possible to meet the challenges. And the issue of youth mobility is in both our interests," said the President at the final press conference of the extraordinary European Council that brought together the 27 European heads of state and government in Brussels.
