   Failure to grasp opportunities Brexit offered Birmingham Evening Mail March 18, 2024 Monday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Midland Independent Newspapers plc All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 17 Length: 254 words Byline: JULIAN KNIGHT Body   AS someone who passionately believes in a free market and a small state, I find the national debt figures in the Budget truly appalling. We have gone from a position where our national debt figure was 37% just prior to the financial crisis to one where it is close to 100% today. That is a two and a half times increase, most of which has come on a Conservative majority Government's watch - of all things! In 2010 and 2015, we had huge opportunities to reset the relationship between the state, the individual and businesses, which are the only means of growing the tax base in this economy but we have failed to grasp the opportunities of Brexit. It should have been an opportunity to deregulate en masse, to make our economy fitter and stronger and to out-compete the Europeans. Instead, our very first move post- Brexit was to impose VAT on tourists, which has been devastatingly counterproductive. It is just an example of the way in which we have failed on Brexit. We have lost and we have shown absolutely no will to grasp those opportunities. If we are going to support Brexit, we have to do it properly. That is the only way to have done it, if we believed in it; we have failed in our will. As a result, this country's finances are more vulnerable than they have ever been. All we are doing is borrowing more and paying ourselves more, for producing less. Unless the supply side is properly tackled by a bold Government, I can see this nation being back at the door of the International Monetary Fund, just like it was in 1976.
