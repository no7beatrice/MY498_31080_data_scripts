   Numbers don’t lie: jobs growth is being dominated by immigration thetimes.co.uk June 11, 2024 Tuesday 11:01 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 994 words Byline: David Smith Highlight: What was feared because of freedom of movement and European Union enlargement has happened instead since Brexit Body   It would have been easy today to focus on the latest labour market statistics, showing rising unemployment, falling employment, fewer vacancies, another increase in economic inactivity and  wage growth still too strong for comfort  for the Bank of England. They have been described variously as “ugly” and “the worst since the pandemic” and they are not what a government would want during an election campaign. Sometimes, though, you see another figure that makes you sit up and take notice. A recent example was from Greg Thwaites, director of research at the Resolution Foundation, who,  in a piece by Jill Treanor, my Sunday Times colleague , pointed out that 90 per cent of new jobs over the past 20 years had gone to foreign-born people. It is a striking statistic, although we should be clear what we are talking about. Jobs are created and destroyed all the time and many millions change employment every year. This is the figure for net new jobs, the addition to employment. And it is true. Twenty years ago there were 28.4 million people in employment in the UK; today it is a fraction under 33 million (32.97 million), an increase of 4.6 million. Over that period, the number of foreign-born workers has gone up from just under 2.6 million to just over 6.8 million, a rise of 4.2 million. That 4.2 million out of a total of 4.6 million is where the 90 per cent figure comes from. The year 2004 is important in this context, because that is when the Labour government under Tony Blair opened Britain’s labour market to new members of the European Union, notably Poland and Hungary, but also the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia. That changed the nation’s labour market, although the period from then until the late 2010s was also characterised by an eventual strong rise in employment among UK-born people and a record employment rate for them. From 2004 to late 2019, 69 per cent of employment growth was among non-UK-born people, with the remaining 31 per cent among the UK-born. Since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, 75 per cent of net new jobs have gone to foreign-born workers, or 62 per cent if the cut-off point is the end of 2019. It is since then, and since Brexit, that the numbers have created that 90 per cent figure, a product of falling employment among the UK-born — down by more than a million since late 2019 — and a rise in overseas-born but non-EU workers, up by a million. What was feared because of freedom of movement and EU enlargement — the substitution of foreign workers for those born in the UK — has happened instead since Brexit, alongside much higher levels of net migration than when this country was a member of the European bloc. A useful new report from the  UK in a Changing Europe  think tank,                     Migration to the UK after Brexit: Policy, Politics and Public Opinion                    , sets out how “taking back control” after Brexit meant that “more liberal policies for work, study and humanitarian migration soon became clear, with a sharp increase in migration to historically unprecedented levels”. Workers no longer come to Britain in large numbers from eastern Europe but from countries such as India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. Sooner or later, all politicians come round to talking about “British jobs for British workers”. Gordon Brown did in 2007 in comments echoed by his successors. The reality, as anybody looking at these figures must acknowledge, is that in the 21st century the UK has become more dependent on foreign workers than at any time in its history. Over the course of 2022 and 2023, 700,000 non-UK, non-EU nationals came to this country to work, slightly offset by a much smaller number, 86,000, who left. The 2019-23 non-EU immigration total for work purposes is just over a million. Given the UK’s dependence on foreign workers, will it ever be possible to get to a much higher employment rate without a further big influx of foreign workers? Labour has set a target of an 80 per cent employment rate, as a proportion of the population aged 16 to 64, compared with 74.3 per cent now (down from 76.1 per cent in late 2019), which would imply an additional 2.3 million or so in work. Based on the experience of the past 20 years, to achieve it would require two million more foreign workers, while the experience of the past four to five years would suggest even more. It is not an impossible target. Stephen Evans, chief executive of the  Learning and Work Institute , points out that Switzerland, the Netherlands and Iceland all have employment rates of above 80 per cent, while Japan and New Zealand are over 79 per cent are rising. Yet to generate an increase in the employment rate to 80 per cent in the UK requires both stronger economic growth and measures to bring more of the economically inactive (22.3 per cent of the working-age population) and unemployed (4.4 per cent) into work. Evans, whose institute advocated an 80 per cent target two years ago, says it can be done with the right investment in skills and training, childcare, reducing record NHS waiting lists and coaching the economically inactive into or back into work. Halving the employment gap facing disabled people — a 2017 Tory commitment — would mean another 1.2 million people in work. “We need the next wave of reform and change to open up job opportunities to more groups (particularly disabled people, but others too) who want to work,” he says. “This is partly a response to an ageing population, as well as opening up opportunities to everyone who wants to work but doesn’t get the help today.” Even if such a programme were to be adopted by the new government immediately, however, it would take time for the effects to come through, probably years. The UK will continue to depend on foreign workers for the foreseeable future. And it is folly to deny it.
