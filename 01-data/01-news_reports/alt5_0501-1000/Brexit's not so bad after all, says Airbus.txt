   Brexit's not so bad after all, says Airbus The Sunday Times (London) February 18, 2024 Sunday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: BUSINESS AND MONEY;BUSINESS; Pg. 1 Length: 260 words Byline: Oliver Gill Body   Brexit has been significantly less disruptive for Airbus's business than the planemaker had feared, its secondin-command has admitted. Christian Scherer, chief executive of commercial aircraft at the Franco-German company, said that Brexit had made operating in the UK "a little bit more complicated" because of additional customs checks and immigration curbs, "but we've adapted and it works," he said. Former Airbus chief executive Tom Enders had warned that a no-deal Brexit would affect tens of thousands of jobs and cost the British economy billions. In 2019, in a threat to pull out of the UK, Enders said: "If there is a no-deal Brexit, we at Airbus will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK." Last November, fellow Brexit critic Nissan, the Japanese car giant, also shrugged off Britain's exit from the EU. Airbus, which employs about 12,000 people in the UK, can trace its British operations back to Hawker Siddeley, the company behind the Second World War Hurricane fighter. Scherer said the UK remained "our centre of competence for wings". "And by virtue of our success, the footprint grows in the UK," he said. "We like the productivity we see here. And we like the quality … so there's no reason to change, despite the adaptation for Brexit." Airbus announced last week that it would pay a special dividend to shareholders after generating net cash of more than (EURO)10 billion. The aerospace giant also said that it would deliver 800 commercial aircraft to customers this year. Soon aircraft will not need pilots, says Scherer, page 6 Load-Date: February 18, 2024  End of Document
