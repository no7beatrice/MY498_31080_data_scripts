   Letters: Nigel Farage’s remarks on Ukraine have given Reform supporters pause telegraph.co.uk June 23, 2024 Sunday 10:30 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: OPINION; Version:1 Length: 1900 words Byline: By Letters to the Editor Highlight: Plus: The Tories’ lack of fresh ideas; Brexit and EU bottle caps; badgers running wild; my father the PoW; and where have the swallows gone? Body   SIR – As a disillusioned Conservative voter, I had decided that this time I would support Reform UK. Then I read about Nigel Farage’s suggestion that the West is responsible for the war in Ukraine(report, June 22).  This brought me back down to Earth.                      Patricia Essex                     Hedge End, Hampshire SIR – I was considering voting for Reform. Not now.  Ukraine is an independent sovereign country existing within internationally recognised borders. Its application to join Nato was largely the result of its discovery in 2014 that bullies do not recognise neutrality.                      Alastair MacMillan                     Port Glasgow, Renfrewshire SIR – Nigel Farage’s explanation – not justification – for Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine is an uncomfortable truth that other leaders are too quick to dismiss. As Russia’s empire disintegrated, it was given the clear impression that there would be no Nato expansion towards its borders, not least in the assurance offered to Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 by the US secretary of state James Baker (“not one inch”). Despite this, three former members of the USSR and all of its former Warsaw Pact satellite states joined Nato. Little consideration was given to the long-term implications of this huge geopolitical shift.                      Rear admiral Philip Mathias (retd)                     Southsea, Hampshire SIR – Nigel Farage has obviously not read the 1994 Budapest Memorandum signed by Bill Clinton for the United States, John Major for Britain and Boris Yeltsin for Russia. Under its terms, in return for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons, the signatories agreed, among other things, to respect its independence, sovereignty and existing borders. Surely that sovereignty must extend to Ukraine’s right to seek membership of the EU and Nato, which cannot be interpreted as “provocation” of Moscow. I am afraid that Mr Farage’s comments, however well intended, will have only emboldened Putin.                      Sir Gerald Howarth                     Chairman, All-Party Parliamentary Group on Ukraine, 2015-17Chelsworth, Suffolk  SIR – I was impressed by Nigel Farage’s BBC interview with Nick Robinson.  Mr Robinson is a ferocious interrogator, yet Mr Farage showed no fear and answered every question vigorously. We need more of these informative exchanges that do not rely on soundbites.                      John Stewart                     Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire SIR – Isn’t the fact that Nigel Farage appears to worship Donald Trump sufficient reason to withhold your vote from Reform?                      C D Gilliard                     Leeds, West Yorkshire                      Pride in Brexit                    SIR – Lord Frost’s article (Comment, June 22)  on being proud of Brexit should be required reading for all parliamentarians.Recent goings on in Europe have only strengthened my view that Britain made the right decision. I suspect the EU will implode within the next 20 years or so. After that, we can resume the relationships we used to have with individual members.                      Jim Bell                     Hereford SIR – Lord Frost is being disingenuous. Both the Brexit and Remain campaigns were wretched and misleading. The Brexit campaign won by a whisker, and it was therefore beholden on all its proponents to deliver the result and claimed benefits so successfully that disappointed Remainers would be brought onboard. They have failed to do so. Complaining about Remain propaganda is a feeble excuse, and it won’t wash. I have no doubt that, had Remain won by a whisker, leading to an equally disappointing and divisive outcome, Lord Frost would have delivered as much anti-Remain propaganda as he could muster.                      Guy de la Bédoyère                     Grantham, Lincolnshire  SIR – I recently drew blood on a sharp projecting piece of plastic on the top of a soft drink bottle. It appears big manufacturers are following EU regulations that require bottle tops to be tethered, in order to reduce littering (Magazine, June 22).  But such tops get in the way of pouring and drinking. Are any British manufacturers willing to take advantage of Brexit freedoms in this case?                      Michael Staples                     Seaford, East Sussex                      Enforcing Blue Badges                    SIR – I too am a Blue Badge holder (Letters, June 22) , and off-street parking is not the only issue whose regulation is at the whim of individual local authorities.  The misuse of designated parking spaces outside residential premises is also subject to such inconsistency. In some areas it is possible to ring an emergency telephone number at any time between 7 am and 1 am to alert a traffic warden, who will issue a parking ticket. The approach of my council, however, appears to be: “Well, report it if you like, but the call will not be dealt with until the office is properly staffed”. This is not much use late at night or over a bank holiday weekend. There have been occasions when I have come close to having to ring the police because a non-badge holder has used the space outside my home. Surely there should be a standard policy for such circumstances.                       Maureen Hastings                     Maidstone, Kent                      Question of coinage                    SIR – Your report, “Antarctic researchers create cool language” (June 21) , suggests that they invented the phrase “Fod plod”. As far as I am aware this term was invented by the RAF Harrier Force in the early 1970s, or maybe earlier. The wonderful aircraft acted like a hoover and had the ability to ingest all manner of foreign objects. As a result, on a field site out in the wilds of Britain or western Europe, everybody – from the most junior to the most senior – would walk along the grass strip and taxiways, staring down, to remove any objects likely to be sucked in and cause “foreign object damage”, or FOD. The morning inspection was always referred to as the “Fod plod”.                      Tom Suffolk                     West Horsley, Surrey                      Badgers running wild                    SIR – As a former wildlife unit field manager for Defra, I would argue that Andrew Sells’s letter (June 22)  on badger vaccination misses some important points.  Badgers dominate our wildlife when left unchecked. They eat hedgehogs, invertebrates and bird eggs, and raid beehives. They are top of the food chain and consume just about anything.  Furthermore, they need to be vaccinated year on year for four years if this measure is to be effective. Unless they are microchipped to identify them, how will that ever be possible?  When there is an imbalance in our wildlife, there is a price to pay. It is unfortunate that the badger, which wreaks havoc among our cattle and alpacas by spreading tuberculosis, is also one of our best-loved mammals.                       Paul Caruana                     Truro, Cornwall                      My father the PoW                    SIR – My father, Herbert Hoffmann, was taken prisoner in France in 1944, then sent to the United States in 1945, working as a cotton picker in Mississippi.  In 1946 he arrived in Liverpool, was sent to help on a farm in Yorkshire and eventually arrived at a PoW camp in Harrow in 1947 (Letters, June 22).  He was put to work building prefab houses (which are still in use today). He couldn’t be repatriated because his home town in eastern Germany was under Russian control and his family were refugees. Prisoners like him were allowed a certain amount of freedom, and one day in April 1948 he was waiting to meet a local English girl. My mother was also waiting nearby to meet another German PoW, who didn’t show up. They got chatting, Mum took him home to meet my grandparents and, the following month, they were married. He spent the rest of his life here and used to delight in pulling people’s legs by telling them he had been Rommel’s batman.                      Rosemarie Lawani                     Stanford in the Vale, Oxfordshire SIR – During the war, we had Italian PoWs working on my grandfather’s farm near Salisbury in Wiltshire. I remember him noticing that every so often a whole sheep would go missing, and remarking to my grandmother that if they could kill and divide up a sheep without being caught then they deserved to keep it. As children we loved them because they made us toys out of empty corned beef tins.                      Richard Beaugie                     Shadoxhurst, Kent                      Avian absences from this summer’s skies                    SIR – This year there appear to be far fewer swallows and swifts in the skies.  Their absence has been particularly noticeable in our part of London. However, we also recently spent a few days in Dorset and Wiltshire, and while these birds were present, their numbers were certainly lower – even though there seemed to be plenty of food available. I wonder whether others have found this to be the case.                      Jeremy Roberts                     London SW13 SIR – It seems the cold, wet spring has harmed the bee population. My lavender hedge is usually visited by hundreds of bees. This year not one has been seen.                      Thomas Bowler                     Northampton                      The Tories need fresh ideas to move forward                    SIR – The headline of your feature (June 21)  on Kemi Badenoch, describing her as a “no-nonsense Thatcherite”, highlights a key problem for the Conservatives – they look backwards, not forward.  Margaret Thatcher left the House of Commons more than 30 years ago.                      John Thompson                     York SIR – If Mrs Badenoch – or indeed Priti Patel – were the Tory candidate in my constituency, I would be out on my Zimmer frame canvassing. As it is, I shall not be voting.                      Charles Hopkins                     Aldington, Kent SIR – I have been dismayed by the many mistakes made by the Conservatives since 2019 and during this election campaign. There has been an extraordinary absence of common sense, and the party has lacked a clear moral compass. A Labour landslide seems inevitable. However, there need to be enough Conservative MPs left to regroup and serve as an effective opposition.  I have an excellent constituency MP. He is currently expected to lose his seat but, in my view, deserves to be re-elected. I would encourage everyone who considers their MP worthy of re-election to support them. If a greater number of Tory MPs survive the carnage, the period of opposition may be shorter than feared.                      Tim Bacon                     Lyme Regis, Dorset SIR – David Platts (Letters, June 22)  says we need “a leader with the spark to excite our thoughts, the nous to create the right team and the ability to transform promises into results”. Having recently seen Rory Stewart at an event, I don’t think we need look any further.
