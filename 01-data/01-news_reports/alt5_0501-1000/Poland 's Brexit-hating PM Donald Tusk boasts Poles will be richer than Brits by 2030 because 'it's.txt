   Poland's Brexit-hating PM Donald Tusk boasts Poles will be richer than Brits by 2030 because 'it's better to be in the EU' MailOnline May 3, 2024 Friday 8:38 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 670 words Byline: Taryn Pedler Body   Tusk's bold claim comes as Poland celebrates 20 years of being in the EU Keir Starmer last year warned that 'Britain was falling behind' in terms of wealth In a 2019 trip to Brussels, Tusk said there is a 'special place in hell' for Brexiteers                      Poland's Brexit-hating Prime Minister Donald Tusk claims Poles will be richer than Brits by 2030 because 'it's better to be in the EU'. In the bold statement made Wednesday, Tusk, 67, vowed to accelerate the country's economic growth, potentially leading to a higher GDP per capita than that of post-Brexit Britain within just five years. Poland's PM was the European Council president during Brexit negotiations and was known for his extreme criticism of the decision to leave the EU. 'A fierce debate is taking place in Great Britain caused by the World Bank's forecast that GDP per capita will be higher in Poland than in the UK in 2025,' Tusk said in a post to X, formerly Twitter. 'And I promise it: on the 25th anniversary, Poles will be richer than Brits. It's better to be in the European Union,' he added, underscoring his strong belief in the benefits of EU membership. His statement comes as Poland celebrates 20 years since joining the EU, a period that has seen significant economic growth and development. According to data by the Finance Ministry, Poland's GDP has already almost doubled since joining the EU in 2004. The Polish Institute of Economics reports that the country's GDP is now a staggering 40 per cent higher than it would be had it not become a member of the European Union. Last year, analysts for the British Labour Party noted that if current trends continued, the UK's GDP would be around £480 less that Poland's within a five-year timeframe. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour Party Leader, stressed that while the UK was lagging behind, its European neighbours, including Poland, were becoming wealthier. He pointed to World Bank data from 2010 to 2021 that suggested GDP per capita in 2021 was £35,935 in Britain and £27,894 in Poland. This showed an average economic growth of 0.5 per cent for the UK and 3.6 per cent for Poland. That would mean Poland would overtake the UK by 2030, according to the calculations. Sir Keir warned: 'The British people are falling behind while our European neighbours get richer, in the east as well as in countries like France and Germany.

'Nor am I prepared to accept what the consequences of this failure would mean.' Tusk claimed his second stint as prime minister - a job he had left to become European Council president in December 2014 - in the Polish general election last year. During a 2019 trip to Brussels, Tusk sparked fury when he said there is a 'special place in hell' for people who pushed for Brexit without a plan. Tusk's bold claim comes just one week after UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak visited Poland to meet with Tusk for talks about aid for Ukraine. In a joint speech, the Tory leader and Polish PM said 'we are allies in the long term', following a £500 million pledge in military aid for Ukraine by the British government.  'We will never forget in Britain that it was Polish pilots that gave their lives to protect our country in the Battle of Britain,' they said. 'And today we're proud to stand together as NATO allies. Two of Europe's biggest military powers. Two of Ukraine's firmest friends.' Sunak added: 'And across Europe, I think Poland and the UK are part of a growing wave of countries that are taking greater responsibility for our collective security. 'Poland is spending more of its GDP on defence than any NATO ally in Europe. 'And with today's announcement, the UK will be spending more in cash terms than any NATO ally in Europe.'
