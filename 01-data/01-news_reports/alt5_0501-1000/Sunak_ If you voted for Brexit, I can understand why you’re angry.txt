   Sunak: If you voted for Brexit, I can understand why you’re angry telegraph.co.uk June 12, 2024 Wednesday 9:57 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 11036 words Byline: By Dominic Penna, Political Correspondent Body   Rishi Sunak has said that he understood why Brexit voters were “frustrated and angry” by the more than doubling of net migration since the EU referendum. The Prime Ministeraccepted that immigration was “too high”  and added that he appreciated “people’s cynicism” about his promises to bring it down. During a televised interview, he also admitted he could “absolutely understand people’s frustrations” with both himself and the Tories as he acknowledged public fury over NHS waiting lists, partygate, and his decision to leave the D-Day commemorations early. He made the remarks as he was questioned over the Tories’ record during a Sky News election debate on Wednesday evening. Mr Sunak was confronted with figures  that show net migration has run at 1.9 million over the past three years, compared with 836,000 in the three years up to the Brexit referendum. The statistics caused gasps from the audience in Grimsby, where 70 per cent of people voted for Brexit following promises it would bring migration down. “I’m sure people feel frustrated and angry about it,” the Prime Minister responded, adding: “Immigration is too high – I’m not making any bones about that.” Mr Sunak appeared to blame Boris Johnson, the former prime minister, arguing that the number of visas being issued had fallen during his own 18 months in office. He said it came down by 10 per cent last year and was set to fall by a further quarter this year after he launched a crackdown on people bringing dependants to the UK. Confronted by the failure of successive Tory leaders to meet their pledges on migration, he added: “I can completely understand people’s cynicism about this. “I’ve had this job for 18 months. Numbers were down last year, they are down considerably at the start of this year and they’ll keep coming down.”                      ‘Planes are booked for Rwanda’                    Mr Sunak also insisted the first flight of asylum seekers would take off for Rwanda on July 24 as planned, and said that more would follow. Asked if he was confident the scheme to deport small boat arrivals would finally be up and running this summer, he said: “Yes. What we’ve done isalready started detaining people , airfields are on standby, planes are booked.” He denied suggestions that he had called the snap election because he feared that his main border policy would fall foul to further delays. Mr Sunak said he had decided to call the election because he felt that he had stabilised the economy sufficiently to start making promises about future tax cuts. “An election is an important moment for our country and my priority when I got this job was to restore economic stability,” he said. “To me, with that economic foundation established, it was the right moment to have an election.” During the interview, the Prime Minister also pledged to keep cutting taxes for workers, admitting that the burden on working families was “too high”. He insisted that the tax burden would come down by 1 per cent by the end of the decade, denying claims that it would continue to rise regardless. Mr Sunak also issued another public apology for his decision to leave D-Day commemorations early  to film an interview with ITV. The Prime Minister was heavily criticised by veterans and members of his own Cabinet after he skipped a ceremony involving Emmanuel Macron and Joe Biden. He said: “The last thing that I wanted to do was to cause anyone – particularly our veterans’ community – any hurt or upset. “It was a mistake and that’s why I apologise unreservedly and I’m deeply sad to have caused people hurt and upset by that.” In an awkward moment Mr Sunak was challenged by Amy, a former local Conservative chairwoman, over his decision to leave the commemoration. She told the Prime Minister: “I’m a lifelong true blue but in this election I find myself an undecided voter. Actions taken by this Government actually make me feel ashamed. You left David Cameron at the D-Day celebrations to represent our country. “To me this feels like a deliberate action as you know that your ratings in the polls are so low.” Mr Sunak faced laughter and boos from the audience at one point. Answering questions about the five pledges he made in January 2023, he said: “The most important priority was the first one, because when I got this job, inflation was at 11 per cent and I think everyone knows the last few years have been difficult, the impact that was having on all your bills.” He faced laughter when he said: “It [inflation] was always meant to come down over time.” The Prime Minister also faced questions about rising NHS waiting lists, up to 7.54 million from 7.21 million when he made the pledge. “We’ve not made as much progress on cutting waiting lists as I would have liked,” the Prime Minister said.  He faced groans and boos when he said: “I think everyone knows the impact the industrial action has had, that’s why we haven’t made as much [progress].”                        You can recap the Sky News event below and join the conversation in the comments section                     here                        .                                         12 Jun 2024-08:56PM GMT                                         That’s all for tonight...

Asked for his response to the snap poll, Mr Spencer said: “That’s certainly not how I would call it, but if that is the poll, that is the poll.  “But what of course matters is those floating voters in the middle and how they view that and I think people will have seen through Keir Starmer is not answering the question.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:50PM GMT                                         Starmer has not done the deal yet with the British public, says Tory minister                    A Conservative minister said Sir Keir Starmer has not “done the deal yet with the British public”, writesGenevieve Holl-Allen. Mark Spencer, a former environment minister, said that he believed there was a “proper contrast” between Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir. He told journalists: “I thought there was a proper contrast between what the PM said in terms of his plan and how Starmer just wouldn’t answer any questions about what he would do.  “He was pretty good at setting out what the problems are, but then when somebody said well what you do, he then pivoted straight back to what the problems are.” He added: “I don’t think Starmer has done the deal yet with the British public. I don’t think they know what he stands for. But they want to be convinced by the Conservative Party again to support.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:41PM GMT                                         Audience laughs at Starmer’s ‘toolmaker’ father                                         12 Jun 2024-08:40PM GMT                                         This is not just a ‘good eight’ out of ten...                    A Conservative minister has rated Rishi Sunak’s performance during the Sky leaders event a “good eight” out of ten, Genevieve Holl-Allenreports. Mark Spencer, an environment minister, said that Sir Keir Starmer was “very good at not answering the question” but added that even in the case of Mr Sunak there was “always room for improvement”. Asked how he would rate the Prime Minister’s performance, Mr Spencer said: “I think he was a good eight.” He added: “I’m trying to be as fair as possible, to be honest… There’s always room for improvement.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:36PM GMT                                         Tories are playing The Generation Game, says Ashworth                    A Labour frontbencher hit out at the Tory manifesto as a “desperate wish list” which would lead to more borrowing, Genevieve Holl-Allenwrites. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general, said: “Yesterday, you saw a desperate wish list as long as your arm of a whole load of commitments, splurged out based on promises they cannot fund, savings they cannot find, the money is not there.  “I mean, there’s been so much splurged out for Rishi Sunak, I was half-expecting him to come on stage and offer a cuddly toy as if it was The Generation Game as the latest thing that he’s got to offer the British public.  “Rishi Sunak’s plans, because the money is not there, will lead to more borrowing with pressure on interest rates and homeowners facing a mortgage increase of £4,800.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:28PM GMT                                         Conservatives: Don’t give Starmer a blank cheque                    A Conservative Party spokesman said: “Keir Starmer wasn’t honest when he ran to be Labour leader and he’s not being honest now. He said he wouldn’t pay for private healthcare for his loved ones last week. This week he’s admitted he has it. “Last week he said he wasn’t going to raise taxes, now its emerged Rachel Reeves is planning to raise 12 taxes. But we know that because Labour’s plans are unfunded and going to cost working families £2,094. “They are refusing to say what they would do because they know it would lose them votes. Keir Starmer is asking for a blank cheque and it’s becoming clear what he wants to do with it-put up your taxes. Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have a clear plan to cut taxes, backed by bold action, to chart a course to a more secure future for Britain.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:24PM GMT                                         ‘Nothing robotic’ about Starmer’s performance, says Ashworth                    A Labour frontbencher has insisted there was “nothing robotic” about Sir Keir Starmer particularly when talking about his children, writesGenevieve Holl-Allen, The Telegraph’s Political Reporter in the spin room in Grimsby. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general, said: “I’ve got two daughters-I’ve got a 13-year-old and a 10 year old-and I could entirely identify with what he was saying because I think everybody who puts themselves forward for public service, which is an important cause, you’re putting yourself forward because you’re doing it in the national interest, he wants to serve this country we love.”  Mr Ashworth added: “Anybody who puts themselves forward for elected office I think always has that concern, always feels that sense of emotional protection for your own children and when he spoke up it was incredibly moving and nothing robotic about it.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:16PM GMT                                         Sir Keir Starmer clear winner in snap YouGov poll                    Sir Keir Starmer was the clear winner of the Sky leaders’ event, according to a snap YouGov poll. Sixty-four per cent of viewers surveyed believed the Labour leader won, while 36 per cent said Rishi Sunak won. A total of 1,864 people were asked by YouGov who they thought performed best, leaving aside their own party preference.                      12 Jun 2024-08:14PM GMT                                         ‘In the case of the Labour Party, Jeremy is gone’                    A Labour spokesman said comparing how Sir Keir Starmer has dealt with Jeremy Corbyn to how Rishi Sunak has dealt with Liz Truss shows a “clear contrast” in their leadership abilities, Genevieve Holl-Allenreports from Grimsby. Asked about Sir Keir saying that he only backed Mr Corbyn because he was “certain” he would not win, the party spokesman said: “I think it’s important to look at what did he do when he was actually in a position of leadership, when he had the ability to change the party.  “He has been absolutely determined in doing so and I would just ask you to draw this contrast: Starmer’s predecessor is not a Labour candidate. This general election, Rishi Sunak’s predecessor, Liz Truss is still a candidate, is still running around causing havoc and organising on the back benches.  “And so if you want a question of leadership, and I think there’s a very clear contrast to draw there, between how those candidates for prime minister have dealt with their predecessors. And in the case of the Labour Party, Jeremy is gone. “                      12 Jun 2024-08:13PM GMT                                         Labour: Starmer will always put country before party                    Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign coordinator, said: “Keir Starmer showed in his answers tonight that he will always put country before party. That’s what has driven the changes he has made to Labour over the past few years. “Rishi Sunak showed tonight that he’s out of touch and unable to deliver. The Conservatives will leave mortgage holders £4,800 worse off. “Our manifesto will set out our plan for change. It’s time to end the chaos, turn the page and start to rebuild with Labour.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:11PM GMT                                         Wes Streeting praises Starmer’s ‘thoughtful’ answers                    Wes Streeting praised Sir Keir Starmer’s “thoughtful” answers to questions during tonight’s Sky leaders’ event. “Rishi Sunak would not level with us on the fact that the tax burden will continue to rise under the Conservatives, and he didn’t level on the fact that so many of his plans are unfunded,” Labour’s shadow health secretary said. “We’ve seen this movie before with Liz Truss. What Rishi Sunak offers is Liz Truss on steroids, because he’s desperate and throwing out unfunded promises.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:10PM GMT                                         Cleverly: Sunak was willing to answer difficult questions                    James Cleverly, the Home Secretary, said Rishi Sunak was “willing to answer difficult questions in stark contrast to Keir Starmer”. Mr Cleverly said Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, came out with “wordy and hard to disagree with statements” but had in practice “refused” to rule out tax rises. “Taxes would go up as sure as night follows day, and when asked to deny it, he failed to do so.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:09PM GMT                                         People are crying out for change, says Wes Streeting                    Asked what stood out for him, Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said people are “crying out for change”. “When they see Labour’s manifesto, people will see every promise we make is a promise we can keep and the country can afford. “We’ve made difficult choices that mean we can put forward a credible plan and we are ready to go. “We’re not taking the outcome of the next election for granted, we’re working hard for every vote, but we’re desperate to offer the change the country is crying out for.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:08PM GMT                                         James Cleverly: Starmer is refusing to be honest about Corbyn                    James Cleverly questioned Sir Keir Starmer’s “integrity” in his answer about Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. The Home Secretary told Sky News: “Basically his answer was that he was being dishonest with the British people, either then or now, we’re not sure which, but it didn’t matter because he didn’t really think that Jeremy was going to win. “I think if you’re going to try to put yourself forward as someone of integrity, that answer’s going to be really, really damaging. “He basically said either he didn’t believe Corbyn should be prime minister, in which case he was lying then, or he did believe it, in which case he’s lying now. But the bottom line is you can’t have it both ways. “He could not be honest about his relationship with Corbyn... It was incredibly damaging.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:05PM GMT                                         Jeers, heckles and Jeremy Corbyn – this was not the interview Starmer wanted                    This has been by far the toughest examination Sir Keir Starmer has undergone on live TV since this election campaign started, writes our Associate EditorGordon Rayner. Within the space of a few minutes, the Labour leader refused to rule out tax rises and defended his support of Jeremy Corbyn in 2019 by saying he was convinced his party was going to lose. He was laughed at, heckled and challenged by the people of Grimsby on a distinctly uncomfortable night for him. Sky’s Beth Rigby brought a no-nonsense approach to ceremonies, pushing Sir Keir into places he did not want to go, and repeatedly challenging him on whether he could be trusted. She reminded him that he had campaigned for Mr Corbyn, then expelled him; had made a series of Left-wing promises then dumped them, in a career of “broken promises and changed positions”. : This was Starmer’s toughest grilling yet                      12 Jun 2024-08:04PM GMT                                         What you made of Rishi Sunak’s performance tonight                                         12 Jun 2024-08:04PM GMT                                         Have your say: Who came out on top tonight?                                         12 Jun 2024-08:04PM GMT                                         Taxes could rise under Labour, Starmer suggests                    Sir Keir Starmer has suggested taxes could rise under a Labour government after he was repeatedly challenged to rule out increases to capital gains tax, fuel duty and council tax. Interviewed by Sky News’s Beth Rigby, the Labour leader pledged that working people would not pay any more tax under his government and said the policies in his manifesto did not require tax rises. But when presented with specifics, he did not rule out future tax rises, giving himself wiggle room for increases in future Budgets. Sir Keir, who is on a six-figure salary as Leader of the Opposition, said he would personally be prepared to pay more tax. He was also challenged over whether Labour’s plan to increase VAT on private schools was a tax on “working parents”.

Rishi Sunak said on national service he was “incredibly excited” for his young daughters to do national service, arguing it would “foster a culture of service in our society” and “contribute to our long-term resilience and security”. “That’s just one thing. A couple of days after that we announced another big policy, which is why we’re going to curb the investment into rip-off degrees and put the money into apprenticeships.” On whether people would be criminalised for saying no to national service, Mr Sunak responded: “No, of course not, of course that’s not the thing. What I said is we would set up a national commission.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:57PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak: A vote for Reform is a vote for Starmer                    Rishi Sunak said a vote for Reform “ultimately is a vote to put Keir Starmer into No 10”. “If you’re someone who cares about cutting taxes, protecting pensions, an approach to net zero that prioritises cutting your bills, I’m the person that’s going to deliver for you, not Keir Starmer. “Keir Starmer doesn’t have a plan on immigration, Keir Starmer is not going to cut your taxes... That’s the choice for you and everyone else thinking about it.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:56PM GMT                                         Sunak: This is about the future you want for your country                    Amy from Leeds, a former chairman of her local Conservative branch, said she felt “ashamed” of her party and was now undecided, asking Rishi Sunak about how he planned to rebuild public trust in the wake of the D-Day row. Rishi Sunak replied: “When it comes to D-Day as I said I absolutely did not mean to cause any offence or hurt, I made a mistake and I unreservedly apologise for it. When it comes to trust in my commitment to veterans and the pride we have in our country, I ask you to look at my actions... It’s something I care deeply about. This election is about the future and the future that you want for our country.” Mr Sunak said his manifesto was “very clear” and would bring down migration while delivering a “more sensible” approach to net zero and protecting pensioners. Amy went on to raise the Downing Street parties scandal and Mr Sunak’s fixed penalty notice, saying: “That’s where the trust broke down. I appreciate the apology tonight but you have to realise there is a long way to go to really rebuild that.” The Prime Minister said: “Those rules were difficult for everyone to follow and the government absolutely should have gone above and beyond. I deeply regret what happened, I apologised for it at the time and it was an extraordinarily difficult time for our country. Trust takes time to rebuild through actions... You earn trust through your actions, making progress on the things that matter to people.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:52PM GMT                                         Sunak asked about ‘systemic’ racism in the police                    Christina asked about “systemic racism, sexism and misogyny” in British policing, and how he would improve relations an build trust between the police and minority communities. “Misogyny, racism, discrimination has absolutely no place in our society, particularly when it comes to the police,” Rishi Sunak responded, citing “appalling” high-profile cases “that have shocked us to the core”. “A small minority of people were behaving in a way that was completely reprehensible... The Met in particular, there are issues, we instituted a report that was done and the new Met Commissioner is now working through to improve relations.” Mr Sunak said there would be an extra officer for every neighbourhood, before again acknowledging issues in the Met.                      12 Jun 2024-07:50PM GMT                                         ‘We are recruiting and training more staff than ever’                    An audience member interrupted Rishi Sunak to say new buildings “are not going to cure the problem, it’s going to make things worse”. Mr Sunak said “we are recruiting and training more staff and nurses than we ever have”. “Where I very respectfully disagree with you, based on all the clinical advice we’ve had from our medics, is we can improve care for patients... Another example of that is pharmacies.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:48PM GMT                                         We’re doing things differently in the NHS, says Sunak                    Rishi Sunak insisted the Government was “investing record amounts” in the NHS but also “doing things differently”, citing community diagnostic centres and hospital hubs.                      12 Jun 2024-07:47PM GMT                                         Sunak: I’m doing the right thing for the NHS in the long term                    Hamza, who works in the NHS, said to Rishi Sunak he had seen “the chronic effect” of underfunding in the NHS and staff burnout, “with waiting lists seeming to never end”, talking about how he had been left on a stretcher for eight hours. Asked how he would restore pride in the NHS, Mr Sunak said: “I come from an NHS family. Like you, like my parents, they worked in the NHS, my dad was a GP, my mum was a pharmacist... What they instilled in me was the importance of how we could continue to help people. “That’s why we’ve put record funding into the NHS. But your point is the right once, what we have done not just for years but for decades is train enough staff... The NHS has never had a long-term workforce plan, but for the first time it does. “Candidly, with the best will in the world, I won’t be here in the 14 years it takes to train a consultant that we’re paying for today, but I thought it was the right thing to do for the NHS in the long term.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:44PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak grilled on homes for young people                    The first audience question to Rishi Sunak comes from Ian, a retired teacher from Grimsby. He said mortgages had become far less affordable for young people like his 19-year-old daughter in the wake of the mini-Budget. “She was kind of hoping to buy a home until you put the mortgage rates up and you failed to meet the housing targets,” Ian said. Mr Sunak replied: “I want everyone to be able to own their own home, it’s a really magical thing when you can, and the best way for us to do that is to get interest rates down again in the first instance, and that’s why I made it a priority to bring inflation down... Hopefully we’re on the right path then and hopefully you’ll see that reflected in mortgage rates.” The Prime Minister said he would abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers buying homes up to £425,000, as well as a new version of ‘Help to Buy’.                      12 Jun 2024-07:41PM GMT                                         Sunak says he needs his Haribo and Twix fix                    Rishi Sunak said he had an “appalling diet because I eat an enormous amount of sugar”. “I was talking to someone today and they were surprised by the amount of Haribos, Twixes and everything I get through, especially during the campaign.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:40PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak: This election is about the future                    Rishi Sunak insisted he “believes in cutting people’s taxes now we’re in a position to do so having restored economic stability”. On whether the tax burden would go up in the next Parliament, Mr Sunak insisted: “Taxes for working people will continue to go down. The tax cuts that we’ve announced reduce the tax burden by about one percentage point of GDP a year compared to the Spring Budget last year.” Mr Sunak said “of course” the tax burden was high but noted he had to take “difficult decisions” as chancellor to support the country through furlough, the pandemic and the energy crisis. Beth Rigby asked whether Mr Sunak acknowledged that his problem was “broken promises”, specifically on Brexit, levelling up, migration and the NHS. “Of course I understand people’s frustrations, it’s been a very difficult few years. We’ve been through two once-in-a-century shocks that have had an enormous impact on everyone, on public services, on standards of living... This election now is about the future and I do believe we’ve turned a corner. You don’t get any change unless you’ve got a plan and our manifesto sets out a way to do that.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:36PM GMT                                         Analysis: Things are less brutal for Sunak so far                    Rishi Sunak, like Sir Keir Starmer, has been given a tough start by Beth Rigby, who asks him about his terrible poll ratings and his D-Day gaffe, writesGordon Rayner. Unlike Sir Keir though, none of his answers in the early exchanges have been revelatory. On the subject of the polls, he accepts that “it hasn’t been an easy 18 months in general” but says, a little unconvincingly, that “I’m excited about talking to people about our plans for the future”. Rigby asks whether his decision to leave D-Day early might be terminal, and he says: “It was a mistake and that’s why I apologised unreservedly for that-I was incredibly sad to have caused hurt and upset, I hope people can find it in their hearts to forgive me.” Uncomfortable for him to have to revisit the D-Day error, but this is familiar stuff, as are Rigby’s questions about his five pledges on stopping the boats, bringing down NHS waiting lists and improving the economy. Compared with Sir Keir, this has been far less brutal so far.                      12 Jun 2024-07:36PM GMT                                         We will have legal migration cap for first time, says Rishi Sunak                    Rishi Sunak said Britain was on track to halve migration in just over three years’ time, pointing to his Government’s crackdown on social care visa abuse and the number of dependents people can bring. “What we have said we will do is have a migration cap that’s voted on in Parliament of the number of migrants that will come. The key thing here is there will be for the first time a legal cap on migration so the numbers continue to come down. “I can completely understand people’s cynicism on this. But since I’ve been in charge, numbers down 10 per cent and visas issued this year, down by a quarter... Numbers were down last year, they were down significantly at the start of this year.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:33PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak: Migration numbers are too high                    Beth Rigby was applauded as she asked Rishi Sunak why he called an election if he was so confident in the success of the Rwanda scheme, to which Mr Sunak said it was an “important” moment for the country and his main priority was economic stability. She went on to ask the Prime Minister about net legal migration, which has totalled 1.9 million in the past three years, compared to 836,000 in the three years before the Brexit vote. Challenged on how he thought Brexit voters felt, Mr Sunak said: “It’s too high. I’ve been clear that it’s too high. I’m sure people feel frustrated and angry about it. Yes, I did support Brexit, and I believe that was the right decision for our country. I just said I’m sure people feel frustrated and again the numbers are too high, of course they’re too high.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:30PM GMT                                         Sunak refuses to put number on Rwanda flights                    Rishi Sunak insists small boat crossings were down by a third last year, adding: “Everyone said it was impossible to get anything done about this problem.” On crossings rising by 40 per cent year-on-year to date in 2024, Mr Sunak responded: “If you look at the sum total of the time I’ve been Prime Minister... You’ve picked one particular period. If you look at the sum total of time I’ve been Prime Minister, the numbers are down. These things are cyclical because what you’ve seen is one new country, Vietnam, accounting for most of the new arrivals.” Mr Sunak declined to put a number on how many people would be flown to Rwanda over the summer, promising a “regular rhythm of flights, not just one”. “I believe that if people come here illegally, they should not be able to stay, we need to have somewhere safe to remove them, and that’s what Rwanda is about.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:28PM GMT                                         Our NHS plan is working, insists Rishi Sunak                    When it was put to him NHS waiting lists had included, meaning another pledge had not been met, Rishi Sunak replied: “Yes, it has. Yes, I was... We’ve not made as much progress on cutting waiting lists as I would have liked. It has proved more difficult for a number of reasons, obviously recovering from the pandemic was not easy. But we are making progress.” Mr Sunak insisted the plan was “working”, and said “everyone knows the impact the industrial action has had” on the NHS, to boos from the audience. “Having resolved all the industrial action except the junior doctors, what we’re now seeing is waiting lists coming down.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:27PM GMT                                         John McDonnell makes last-minute plea to Starmer                    Veteran Labour politician John McDonnell has made a last ditch appeal for scrapping the two-child benefit cap to be included in the manifesto, after Sir Keir said it would not be there, writesGenevieve Holl-Allen. Writing on X, Mr McDonnell, who served as shadow chancellor under Jeremy Corbyn, said: “I’ve consistently campaigned for scrapping of the 2 child limit but we heard tonight it will not be in manifesto.  “I know this is the very last minute for an appeal for an amendment to the Labour Manifesto but before it is published tomorrow I am appealing for this to be included.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:26PM GMT                                         Sunak: My most important priority was cutting inflation                    Rishi Sunak said his “most important priority” was cutting inflation, which was at 11 per cent when he took office. “It wasn’t a given, it was 11 per cent, now it’s back to normal...” On the national debt being higher than when he promised to reduce debt, Mr Sunak said “it was always meant to come down over time”, to laughter from the audience. “No tricks, no ambiguity,” Beth Rigby quoted back at him, to further laughter and applause. Mr Sunak said it was “really important” that he had met all the UK’s fiscal rules.                      12 Jun 2024-07:24PM GMT                                         Prime Minister: I was right to have disagreed with Liz Truss                    Beth Rigby asked Rishi Sunak how people knew he would still be prime minister in a year if he won the election. “I can appreciate people’s frustrations, of course we haven’t got everything right... What I can do is work as hard as I can to deliver the stability I said I would. And I’ve had this job for 18 months and I think particularly on the economy people can see that inflation is back to normal, the economy’s growing, wages are rising. “And that’s why we’re having this election now... I want to build on [my track record] so we can continue on the progress we’ve made.” Asked whether Liz Truss’s legacy cast a “long shadow” for him, Mr Sunak said: “I disagreed with her economic policies and actually it wasn’t easy for people to hear what I had to say. But I believed very deeply then in what I was saying. “I was right about that and that’s why people can trust me when it comes to what I say about the economy today.                      12 Jun 2024-07:21PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak: It hasn’t been an easy 18 months                    Asked about a poll that put the Conservatives only one point ahead of Reform, and his polling being worse than under Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak replied: “It hasn’t been an easy 18 months in general. What I’ve done though is just keep going to just do my best for people. I’m excited to have the opportunity to talk to everyone, not just tonight, but up and down the country about my plans for the future. “I do believe we’ve turned a corner and we’ve got a clear plan for the future, to protect people, to cut taxes, to protect their taxes... I’m going to keep fighting hard until the last day of this election.” On the D-Day controversy, Mr Sunak said: “The last thing I wanted to do was cause anyone, particularly our veterans community, any upset. It was a mistake and that’s why I apologised deeply for that. I was privileged to participate in all the commemoration events I did, speak to veterans...” On whether he felt “really awful”, he replied: “I was incredibly sad to have caused people hurt and upset. I hope people can find it in their hearts to forgive me. I’ve asked for forgiveness and also I have been speaking to veterans about the things we are doing for them after they’ve served.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:19PM GMT                                         Here’s Sunak                    It is now Rishi Sunak’s turn to face questions from Beth Rigby, Sky News’s political editor, live in Grimsby.                      12 Jun 2024-07:17PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak accuses Starmer of ‘just not answering the questions’                    Keir Starmer just doesn't answer the questions.-RS #BattleForNo10                      12 Jun 2024-07:16PM GMT                                         Your verdict on Sir Keir Starmer’s interview and Q&A                                         12 Jun 2024-07:16PM GMT                                         Sir Keir Starmer fields his last question                    Kieran from Guildford said young people in the country had “grown up knowing nothing but Conservative austerity and political chaos”. Kieran said younger people paid more taxes than their parents and were less likely to be able to buy a house. Sir Keir said he was “clear that I understand the challenges that you set out”, saying he wanted people to tell him the changes they wanted to see. “We need good quality high skilled jobs for the future of our young people. We need to make sure that we’re building enough houses to make sure young people can get on the housing ladder.” That brings an end to Sir Keir’s question-and-answer session, with Rishi Sunak up next.                      12 Jun 2024-07:13PM GMT                                         Starmer: You don’t need to be tribally Labour                    Sir Keir Starmer said most British people are “tolerant”, “live and let live” and “you don’t need to be tribally Labour for that”. Kayman, the audience member, won applause when he said “you don’t seem to answer the question”.                      12 Jun 2024-07:12PM GMT                                         Audience member calls Starmer ‘political robot’                    Kayman said Sir Keir Starmer had “fallen into more of a politician” in the past year, accusing him of seeming like a “political robot”. He asked the Labour leader how he would convince others like him to vote for him, and was laughed at for hesitating. “I was the chief prosecutor for five years, effectively bringing every criminal prosecution in England... I worked before that in Northern Ireland so I’ve had that constant theme in my life of trying to serve the public. “That’s why I took the decision to go into politics. I came into politics quite late in life, I’d done other things beforehand, but I took the approach I couldn’t make the changes I wanted to by not coming into politics.” Asked if he thought he had changed, Sir Keir said he was “much clearer in my own mind that the country must come first”.                      12 Jun 2024-07:10PM GMT                                         There is a ‘huge problem’ of dentist deserts, says Labour leader                    Sir Keir Starmer was asked how he would fix the crisis in NHS dentistry. The Labour leader said it was a “huge problem” that there were dental “deserts” where appointments were not available. “The first thing to do is make the money available for 700,000 urgent appointments in NHS dentistry, including 100,000 for children which is desperately needed. The second is to incentivise newly-qualified dentists to set up as NHS dentists by paying them money to put down their roots in the areas they are most needed.” Sir Keir said children going to hospital for their rotting teeth was a “disgrace in England in 2024”.                      12 Jun 2024-07:08PM GMT                                         Starmer: Our private school plan is ‘difficult’ but necessary                    Sir Keir Starmer said at the moment there was a tax break on private schools and said his policy was “difficult stuff” but it is a “disgrace” there are children being taught by non-specialist teachers:                      12 Jun 2024-07:06PM GMT                                         Keir Starmer defends private school plans                    Hussain from London said he sends his daughter to a private school, adding he would be “priced out” by Labour’s plan to introduce 20 per cent VAT on independent education fees. Sir Keir Starmer replies: “Let me be really clear about what we’re doing here. I have nothing against private schools, I absolutely recognise that many parents work hard and save hard to send their children to private schools because they have aspiration for their children. “I equally accept that every parent, every parent has aspiration for their children whether they go private school or not. In our state secondary schools we’ve got thousands of teachers missing in the subjects that we need... Too many students, young people, children are being taught maths by sport teachers, by supply teachers, and that’s not acceptable. “And for those children in a state secondary school who don’t have the teachers they need, that’s not a one-year problem or a two-year budgeting problem, it’s a lifelong problem because if they don’t get the qualifications at 15 and 16 they can’t go on and do what they want... We will get rid of the tax break on private schools and use that money directly to fund teachers in our state secondary schools. That’s a political choice, it’s actually a tough choice, I do understand what you’re saying, I don’t think it’ll lead to lots of people going to state education, we’ve done some analysis on that.”                      12 Jun 2024-07:03PM GMT                                         Sunak accuses Starmer of ‘complete waffle’                    The Prime Minister is tweeting from the Conservatives’ X account: Complete waffle. Why can't Keir Starmer just be honest with people and admit he would raise taxes on working families?-RS #BattleForNo10                      12 Jun 2024-07:03PM GMT                                         Starmer: We won’t yield to 35 per cent junior doctor pay demands                    Jonathan from Leeds asked: “I’ve been on strike because I earned more money per hour working part-time as a university student than as a newly-qualified doctor... Scotland and Wales have decided they can pay NHS doctors fairly. How and when will you be able to do the same in England?” Sir Keir Starmer said he was “frustrated if I’m honest that the strikes have gone on as long as they’ve gone on”. Sir Keir said NHS staff had been under “unrelenting” pressure, saying: “Instead of arguing about who gets in the room first to negotiate with doctors, we would roll up our sleeves in a grown-up way so patients can get the care they need, doctors can go back to work and we can move forward... The sooner we can have some grown-up politics in this, the better.” On whether he would pay junior doctors more, the Labour leader said conditions could be “negotiated” but the 35 per cent demanded by striking junior doctors was not realistic. “All that’s happened this year is the Government wants a deal, but we don’t want to go into the room first. The fact they’ve left this to the election I think is disgraceful. It doesn’t do you any good, it doesn’t do patients any good and it doesn’t do the country any good. We’ve had a Government that’s chaotic, that’s divided, has broken just about everything we’ve touched... Almost everything is now in a worse state than when they started in government. If you leave your country in a worse state than when you came into government, you should be booted out.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:59PM GMT                                         We must put more resource into places like Grimsby, says Keir Starmer                    Pressed on how his plans were going to be funded, Sir Keir Starmer said there needed to be “resource” put into fixing local and national issues, with potholes and childcare among areas where reform could happen quickly.                      12 Jun 2024-06:58PM GMT                                         Starmer: Government must create plans with local people’s fingerprints on                    Sharon from Grimsby asked Sir Keir Starmer: “As someone born and bred in Grimsby I’m proud of our town, but it has some of the most disadvantaged areas in the country with high levels of child poverty, inadequate social housing and increasing numbers having to use food banks. How will Labour address these inequalities and improve outcomes for the most disadvantaged residents, both here and across the UK?” Sir Keir replied: “I’ve been to Grimsby a number of times now and my strong impression is you’re absolutely right about the challenges people are facing... What I’ve also been struck by is the pride and ambition that people have in their place and in Grimbsy and the sense that they want a government that matches their ambition. “The way to do that is make sure the Government works with local communities, local businesses. We need a growth plan for Grimsby which your fingerprints are on. I don’t want someone standing in Whitehall or Westminster looking at a map and deciding what they think is best for Grimsby. I think people with skin in the game are the people who make the best decisions... I want the government that partners with you and creates the conditions for businesses to thrive.” Sir Keir recalled speaking to apprentices working in offshore wind, adding: “We need more of that. The supply chains for that should be in and around here, so they’re not in other parts of the country or abroad.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:54PM GMT                                         Starmer having the toughest time on this election                    Credit to Beth Rigby, writesGordon Rayner. She is giving Sir Keir by far the toughest time he has had on live TV so far in this election. Pinning him down on tax, Sir Keir says he has no plans for tax rises other than those already announced, to which Rigby tells the audience: “When someone says ‘no plans’ it means they might.” The audience applauds. Sir Keir says he will not write the next five years worth of budgets right now, but Rigby points out that he has already ruled out increases to National Insurance, VAT or income tax.                      12 Jun 2024-06:53PM GMT                                         I don’t doubt I’m the right man for the job, says Keir Starmer                    Asked what would change people’s minds about him being “boring” and “stiff”, Sir Keir Starmer said he had “believed in service” all of his life. He said he was “clear in my mind” that he wanted to serve his country to put Labour forward as “the only party that’s got a plan for the future”. On what he feared the most, he said: “The only real fear I suppose I have is for my family. I’ve got a boy who is just turning 16, he’s 15-and-three-quarters, and a girl who is 13, these are really difficult ages for my children... My only fear is the impact it’s going to have on them. I want them to be able to walk to school and be unaffected as much as I can. “I don’t fear the big decisions, in fact I relish them. My only fear is actually and the only thing that keeps me up at night is worrying about my children.” Asked if he had any doubts that he was up for the job, he said: “Not at all.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:50PM GMT                                         Starmer: We won’t get rid of two-child benefit cap in manifesto                    Sir Keir Starmer was asked about the two-child benefit cap for families, saying it was a “really difficult decision” not to include its abolition in the manifesto. “Huge damage has been done to our economy by this government... I’m not going to make promises that I can’t keep. “We will have a strategy for child benefit. I think people are fed up with politicians who say before the election they’ll do everything. “It’s a difficult choice, we will have an anti-child poverty strategy.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:49PM GMT                                         Starmer laughed at over toolmaker father                    Asked if he would be “personally happy” to pay more tax, Sir Keir Starmer said: “Of course... I accept I earn a lot of money in the job I am now in.” There was laughter from the audience when the Labour leader said “my dad was a toolmaker, my mum was a nurse, and actually we couldn’t make ends meet, which isn’t a laughing matter”.

Sky’s Beth Rigby pushes him on whether he genuinely believed what he was saying at the time or not. He will only repeat that: “I honestly didn’t think we had a chance of winning that election.” Rigby points out that it is an issue of trust. Sir Keir looks slippery before he has even got into his stride.                      12 Jun 2024-06:47PM GMT                                         Starmer: Higher capital gains tax not in our manifesto                    Sir Keir Starmer said Britain “has to concentrate” on growing the economy, saying fuel duty would be decided “Budget by Budget”. “I want to do things differently. If we just do things in the same way as we’ve done for the last 14 years, we’ll just end up in the same mess. And I’m not prepared to do that.” Sir Keir insisted it was important “to create the wealth to ensure our country will run public services... I ran a public service for five years, I ran a public service in the austerity years. I absolutely care about our public services... I absolutely want our public services to function.” Asked about whether he was attracted to the idea of raising capital gains tax, the Labour leader replied: “That is not a manifesto, that is not a choice we are making. Our manifesto is a manifesto for growth, it’s about we tackle our planning laws, how we get skills for young people, how we set up Great British Energy.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:44PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak booed as he arrives at Sky leaders’ event                    Rishi Sunak booed as he arrives at Sky's special leaders' event #BattleForNo10 Both the prime minister and Sir Keir Starmer will face questions from Sky's political editor as well as from the audience at the Grimsby event  https://t.co/dUOt2d1Lbi pic.twitter.com/WcPn9huVPj                      12 Jun 2024-06:43PM GMT                                         Keir Starmer: I have ‘no plans’ for tax rises                    Asked whether there would be no tax rises of any kind in the next Parliament, Sir Keir Starmer said: “No tax rises for working people... “No tax rises needed in the plans in our manifesto, no tax rises for working people, no rises in income tax, National Insurance or VAT.” Beth Rigby noted when a politician says “no plans”, they mean “I might”. Sir Keir said working people are “paying far too much tax in recent years, and that has made the cost-of-living crisis ten times worse than it would otherwise be”.                      12 Jun 2024-06:42PM GMT                                         Starmer: Wealth creation is the most important thing                    Sir Keir Starmer was asked about his now-abandoned pledge to raise tax on the top five per cent of earners, those earning more than £80,000 a year. “Let me be absolutely clear, all of our plans are fully-costed, fully-funded, we will not raise taxes on working people. There is nothing to raise taxes. “I want to do things differently. I want to grow our economy, I accept that previous Labour leaders have sort of pulled the tax lever every single time and driven up spending. I want to grow the economy-the manifesto tomorrow will be one for wealth creation. For me that is the most important thing.” Asked whether he would put taxes up, Sir Keir said to the first applause of the night: “The Tories are in no position to lecture anyone about tax rises. We’ve got the highest tax burden in 70 years... We’ve got to get the economy going. “The economy is flatlining. We have to address that problem, tomorrow our manifesto is a plan for growth.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:39PM GMT                                         Keir Starmer: Why I changed my mind on nationalising energy companies                    Sir Keir Starmer was asked about his Left-wing Labour leadership pledges including nationalisation and abolishing tuition fees. “Most of them are still in place, and I said they bound up with economic justice. Have I changed my position on those pledges? Yes I have, because I’ve asked myself, are these country first, party second? And if the answer to that is no, I’ve changed them because I think this party should always put the country first.” On nationalising energy companies, Sir Keir said: “Two years ago at the height of the crisis when people were fighting very high bills, I said mock up for me, tell me how much it would cost to nationalise the energy companies, that ran into tens of billions pounds... I thought would have been the wrong decision. “I think most people would say for heaven’s sake, Keir, if there’s a choice between keeping my bills low or paying off shareholders tens of billions of pounds, there’s only one choice you can make. And that’s what I mean by country first, party second.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:37PM GMT                                         Sir Keir Starmer: I stand on my record                    Asked if he accepted there was a trust issue, Sir Keir Starmer replied: “No, because I decided ‘country first, party second’... I dragged my party back to the service of working people because I want to put a Labour Party in front of people here in Grimsby and across the country that they know is credible.” On campaigning for Jeremy Corbyn in 2017 and 2019, Sir Keir said he was “certain we would lose the 2019 election”. “I wanted good colleagues to be returned... I was certain we would lose. Of course I campaigned for the Labour Party, I’ve always campaigned for the Labour Party. I make no apology for that.” On him saying Mr Corbyn would make a “great prime minister”, Sir Keir replied: “I honestly didn’t think we had a chance of winning that election. I wanted to campaign for our colleagues. And then once we got the result that we did, which were the results I expected we might get, as I say I decided to step up to lead the party, not something I had planned to do when I came back into Parliament, and to change it to put it back into the service of working people.” Sir Keir said he had made changes in his work in Northern Ireland and at the Crown Prosecution Service, adding: “I stand on my record.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:34PM GMT                                         Starmer: I’ve had to take difficult decisions to change our party                    Sir Keir Starmer said he was “honoured” to be in Grimsby. Beth Rigby noted Sir Keir told the country Jeremy Corbyn would make a great prime minister then expelled him from Labour, campaigned for a second referendum then stopped talking about the EU, and dumped the Left-wing policies he was elected Labour leader on. “When we lost the 2019 election we lost very badly as a political party, including here in Grimsby where people felt they couldn’t vote for the Labour Party. I concluded I should listen to the electorate and when you lose that badly you don’t look to the voters and say ‘what on earth do you think you were doing’, you look at your party and say ‘we have to change’. “The change I wanted to bring about and I have brought about was to change the Labour Party to bring it back into the service of working people... The country must come first and the party second, so I’ve had to take difficult decisions to change our party.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:31PM GMT                                         Tonight’s format                    Over the next 90 minutes, Beth Rigby will put both leaders through their paces before a question-and-answer session with a live audience in Grimsby. However, Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak will appear separately rather than at the same time.                      12 Jun 2024-06:31PM GMT                                         Starmer is up first                    Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, is up in a second after a draw to decide who would be first to face Beth Rigby, Sky News’s political editor, and a live studio audience in Grimsby .                      12 Jun 2024-06:29PM GMT                                         Grimsby: A town at the heart of the Red Wall                    Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will tonight do battle in Grimsby, a port town at the heart of the ‘Red Wall’ that was so crucial to the Conservatives’ last election triumph. The constituency of Great Grimsby had voted Labour since 1945 but in 2019 returned Tory MP Lia Nici, who became her party’s first representative in the seat for 74 years. The seat is being renamed Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes at the upcoming election, and multiple forecasts suggest that Labour is on course to win the constituency back.  A poll by Redfield & Wilton Strategies last month showed Labour leading the Tories by 25 percentage points across the Red Wall, which is made up of mostly northern and Midlands seats that have traditionally backed Sir Keir’s party but opted for the Tories in 2019. In 2019, the Brexit Party came third with seven per cent of the vote, so it will also be worth watching how its successor Reform UK fares in Great Grimsby on July 4.                      12 Jun 2024-06:28PM GMT                                         Tories: Keir Starmer has no plan for the country                    A Conservatives spokesman said: “Tonight, there will be two people on stage-and only one can be Prime Minister. “The first, Keir Starmer, has absolutely no plan for the country. His £38.5bn blackhole of spending commitments can only mean one thing-£2094 in taxes on working families. “The second, Rishi Sunak has a clear plan for the country, taking bold action to cut taxes and to deliver the secure future this country needs. The choice is clear-vote Conservative on 4 July.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:26PM GMT                                         Sunak: I do not feel threatened by Farage                    ITV just aired a pre-recorded interview with Rishi Sunak by Paul Brand, the presenter of ITV’s Tonight. The programme was broadcast just before Mr Sunak and Mr Starmer face a grilling by Sky News. In the interview, Mr Sunak insisted he did not feel threatened by Nigel Farage. He said: “I’ve been saying I want to bring immigration since the day I got this job, because it’s too high and immigration that’s too high puts pressure on public services, and that’s unfair.” Read how the full interview unfolded here.                      12 Jun 2024-06:20PM GMT                                         Sunak arrives for the event                                         12 Jun 2024-06:17PM GMT                                         What’s at stake for Sir Keir Starmer?                    By contrast to Rishi Sunak, who has set out bold new policies including the return of national service, the ‘triple-lock plus’ on pensions, Sir Keir Starmer has kept his cards close to his chest.  The campaign led by what he calls a “changed” Labour party has explicitly appealed to voters’ appetite for change. Labour’s manifesto will not be published until tomorrow but Sir Keir will find himself under pressure to give voters a better idea of what the country can expect if, as the polls suggest, he is in Downing Street on July 5. With a poll lead to protect, Sir Keir has more to lose tonight and any gaffes or mis-steps could prove costly among an electorate who still know relatively little about the leader of the opposition and his policy offering.                       12 Jun 2024-06:13PM GMT                                         Starmer arrives ahead of event                    Keir Starmer has arrived ahead of the Sky News election debate, in Grimsby. The Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes constituency is newly created following the boundary changes. The old seat, Great Grimsby, is currently held by the Conservatives with a 7,000 majority. The interviews will get underway at 7:30pm, with the Labour leader going first.                       12 Jun 2024-06:08PM GMT                                         Sunak aide bet on July election three days before announcement                    Rishi Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary placed a £100 bet on a July election three days before it was announced. Craig Williams, who is seeking re-election in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, has confirmed he is under investigation by the gambling watchdog after he “put a flutter” on a July poll. “I’ve been contacted by a journalist about Gambling Commission inquiries into one of my accounts and thought it best to be totally transparent,” he said. “I put a flutter on the general election some weeks ago. This has resulted in some routine inquiries and I confirm I will fully cooperate with these. “I don’t want it to be a distraction from the campaign. I should have thought through how it looks.” Dominic Penna and Fiona Parker have the full report.                      12 Jun 2024-06:05PM GMT                                         Labour: ‘Tonight the British people will witness their choice’                    Speaking ahead of the Sky News event, Pat McFadden, Labour’s National Campaign Coordinator, said “tonight the British people will witness the choice at this election.” He said: “A desperate unfunded Conservative manifesto that will leave mortgage holders £4,800 worse off and will mean more of the chaos they’ve inflicted for the last 14 years.  “Or change with the Labour Party, with six fully funded, fully costed first steps to rebuild Britain.”                       12 Jun 2024-06:02PM GMT                                         What’s at stake for Rishi Sunak?                    Rishi Sunak has endured a difficult first half of the campaign.  He called the election outside Downing Street in the pouring rain and was drowned out by protesters playing D:Ream’s Things Can Only Get Better, New Labour’s 1997 anthem. Since then, the Conservatives’ prospects have been dented by the return of Nigel Farage  as leader of the insurgent Reform party, which is outflanking it on the right. The Prime Minister was also forced to apologise last week after returning home early from D-Day commemorations in Normandy to record an ITV television interview. With the Conservatives continuing to trail by around 20 points in the polls, Mr Sunak has a lot of ground to make up and must use tonight’s debate to try to shift the dial in the campaign following the launch of the Tory manifesto yesterday. He will be conscious of the need to win back voters who are planning to abandon the Tories for Reform, although the party is also on track to shed support to Labour and the Liberal Democrats.                      12 Jun 2024-05:59PM GMT                                         What have you missed today?

If you’re just joining our live coverage now, here’s the latest:                                              Sunak has insisted he will not give up on winning the election after polls suggested Labour may win a “super-majority” on July 4                       It came after Grant Shapps earlier suggested Sir Starmer could be on track to win an extrordinary landslide, warning it would put the UK in a “dangerous place”                       Elsewhere, it has emerged that Rishi Sunak’s aide  bet £100 on July election three days before it was announced                       Ed Davey has been on the campaign trail again, repeatedly falling into a lake during his latest election  stunt                       And half of small prep schools could close within a year of Labour taking office because of the party’s proposed VAT raid , the sector’s leader has warned                                                              12 Jun 2024-05:51PM GMT                                         When is the debate and how to watch                    Sky News  will host the UK election leaders “special event” tonight.
