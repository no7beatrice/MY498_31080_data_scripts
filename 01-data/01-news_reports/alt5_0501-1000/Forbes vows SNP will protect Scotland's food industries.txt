   Forbes vows SNP will protect Scotland's food industries The Sunday Herald (Glasgow) June 16, 2024 Sunday  Copyright 2024 Newsquest Media Group All Rights Reserved  Section: Pg. 11 Length: 256 words Byline: F L-Maureen Sugden  Body   Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes has pledged the SNP will protect Scottish food industries like salmon producers. Yesterday, she said that SNP MPs at Westminster will defend the interests of Scotland's food and drink sector from the impact of Brexit. She made a visit to DFDS Logistics in Larkhall, South Lanarkshire, which is the largest haulage company for the Scottish salmon and seafood industry. Earlier this week, trade body Salmon Scotland published its own manifesto ahead of the General Election, calling for an improvement in the UK's relationship with the EU and less red tape for supply chains in the UK and on the continent. Scottish salmon exports were worth £581 million last year. Ahead of her visit, Ms Forbes said: "Our world-famous food and drink exports are the backbone of Scotland's economy, supporting thousands of jobs, bolstering our tourism sector and leading the way in UK exports - no thanks to the trade nightmare that is Brexit. "Since the moment we left the European Union, from workforce shortages to dodgy international trade deals, Brexit has spelled nothing but disaster for food and drink industries across Scotland, who have paid a hard price for a Brexit we didn't vote for. "Neither Labour nor the Tories are prepared or willing to reverse the damage that Brexit has unleashed on our vital food and drink sector, which is why a vote for the SNP July 4 is so important, so we can make sure that our world-leading industries aren't forgotten by a Westminster government that ignores Scotland's interests."
