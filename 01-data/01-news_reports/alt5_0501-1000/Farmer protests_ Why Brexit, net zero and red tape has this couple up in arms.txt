   Farmer protests: Why Brexit, net zero and red tape has this couple up in arms telegraph.co.uk March 26, 2024 Tuesday 4:28 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 556 words Byline: By Anvee Bhutani Highlight: Telegraph reader tells of her independent farm’s struggle to survive amid rising pressures on farmers nationwide Body   “It’s just crucifying,” Telegraph reader Trish Maunder said, describing life of a 21st century farmer in Britain. Trish and her husband Harvey are a British farming couple from Somerset. For four generations their independent farm has been continuously run by the Maunder family. But now they’re struggling to stay afloat amid rising pressures on farmers  nationwide. Farming in 21st century Britain comes with a plethora of challenges , from the cost of fertiliser, spray and machinery going up, to having to tend hundreds of acres of land solo.  For Trish and Harvey, the hardest thing is managing the amount of paperwork with the increased “red tape”.  As per health and safety regulation, the couple is required to produce regular reports and measure temperature, feeding and more for their crops and livestock. They also have to chase up payments at regular intervals.  “Some people pay for a bookkeeper…but we just can’t afford it.” Her husband does all the record keeping himself, but this often leads to a backlog of tasks and work well after sundown.  “It’s just crucifying,” Trish said, recounting the laundry list of never-ending tasks  she and her husband are always engaged in.                       ‘Brexit has made things worse’                    Trish and her husband voted Leave in the 2016 Brexit referendum. She “thought [after Brexit] we would be producing our own food.” But Brexit has not been the silver beacon  that they hoped it would be. “If anything, it’s made things worse,” Trish said honestly. Harvey agreed, saying “Brexit campaigners hoodwinked us. ”  He explained: “Why would you want to distance yourself from your best market, import and export … we were better off trying to influence from within rather than banging on from out.” Climate change has also posed a great challenge to their farm. Trish said exasperatingly, “they want net zero , but that’s just unattainable.”  Harvey added that while it’s a “wonderful ambition”, the reality is “we don’t have a roadmap to get there”.                       ‘Our mental health has taken such a toll’                    The Maunders face particular challenges running a tenant farm, a type of arrangement which makes up 33 per cent of agriculture in England. While they are able to work the land, they do not own it and have to pay rent to a landlord.  While other farmers can rent out parts of their land  or engage in other development to cope with rising costs and pressures, “the tenant farmer has their hands completely tied behind their back,” Trish said.  “Our mental health has taken such a toll  with all the stress and worry,” Trish recounted, speaking of not only pressure from the Government but also from landlords. She’s seen many friends who were previously farmers even quit the profession.                      ‘Without farmers, there’s no food’                    The farmers’ protests both in the UK  and worldwide  came as welcome news to the Maunders. “I love the camaraderie,” Trish said, while admitting that sadly, she and her husband will likely not be able to find the time to protest given all the work on their plate as independent farmers. Nonetheless, she admires them and hopes the movement will shine light on the plight of farmers worldwide. “It makes me feel empowered that they’re standing up for farming. Without farmers, there’s no food.” Load-Date: March 26, 2024  End of Document
