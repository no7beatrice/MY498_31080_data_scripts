   Brexit: four years on, have Times readers’ opinions changed? thetimes.co.uk February 2, 2024 Friday 9:00 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 1050 words Byline: Kevin Reynolds Highlight: On the anniversary of Britain’s formal withdrawal from the EU we asked readers for their views — and you responded in your thousands Body   Four years after Britain formally left the EU, Times readers remain as divided as ever, but largely unchanged in their views on Brexit. Of the 4,444 Times readers who responded to our survey, about a quarter said that they voted Leave in the 2016 referendum and three quarters Remain. Of those, just 1 per cent of Remainers and 3 per cent of Leavers admitted changing their minds on the key issues, but almost a third of Leavers did express frustration at the way Brexit had been handled, with many feeling let down. Peter Jeffrey, 66, from Sutton, who voted Leave, said: “The government has failed to capitalise on the benefits of Brexit, a need to get on with it in terms of trade agreements, stopping immigration and making the most of our independence. The promised bonfire of regulations has failed to materialise.” Carol Werry, 70, from Upminster, said: “The government has not fulfilled their promises. We still have EU rules. We have not controlled our borders. We have seemingly not saved money. The  Northern Ireland customs arrangements  are a joke. Generally, the whole scenario is one of incompetence and we were better off under Brussels.” But other Leave voters were delighted to be out and full of optimism. Alexandra Kingston, 71, from London, said: “I am still glad we left and immensely glad we did not make the ultimate mistake of joining the Euro. Very tired of people moaning about the decision to leave. If it had gone the other way I would have accepted it because I believe in democracy.” Remain voters widely expressed concerns. Derek Condon, 66, from the West Midlands, called it “the biggest mistake made by the UK since the Second World War”. He said: “The current and future damage to the country in terms of economic growth and the global perception will be felt by future generations for many years to come.” Economy The economy was the main reason Remain voters stuck with their initial decision. Joe Jones, 36, from Wimbledon, said: “When we were in the EU our economy regularly outpaced the other large EU economies, whereas now it’s trending below. “The weakness of the pound, which was a clear result of Brexit, has been damaging to our country’s wealth, making imports and going on holiday more expensive.” Matt Bourn, 50, from St Albans, said that he was sad, angry and frustrated at the way the Conservatives ignored the economy. “They have been solely focused on their own party, their own seats and their own pockets, distracted by a minority group of their own MPs who are not representative of the UK as a whole,” he said. Brexit coinciding with the Covid-19 pandemic didn’t escape readers’ attention, either. Adam Millington, 35, from Ipswich, said: “I think there has been some of the economic impact others warned of, but it’s hard to separate the effects of the pandemic from those of Brexit when it comes to trade and the economy.” For that reason he does not think Brexit has caused great economic hardship.  “I think it has now been shown the worst of the doomsayers were wildly pessimistic in their predictions of economic collapse. I am happy that the British parliament is now fully sovereign again,” he said. EU membership and Sovereignty  EU membership factored heavily into the Remain voters decision process in 2016. In 2024, they are not surprised to still feel the same way. John Mckelvey, 73, from Worcester, said: “Leaving the EU offered no real benefits apart from the misguided notion of ‘sovereignty’. The country was not unduly unhappy with the EU except for the whipped up allegations about taking control from the Conservative far right.                    “                    The only reason for the referendum was for David Cameron to try and take back control of his party from the Conservative extremists and to negate the threat of Nigel Farage.” Christopher Jones, 74, from Weston-Super-Mare, said it was “insane to leave”, calling the UK “economically poorer, less secure, more vulnerable, with little compensating value gained through increased sovereignty”. Sovereignty was a heavy consideration at the time of the referendum for Leave voters and it still is now. Most are still satisfied in how it has played out but say we have yet to take advantage of our ability to make our own decisions independently of EU legislation. James Mount, 36, from Birmingham, went one step further. He said: “We now need to leave the ECHR and make the most of being sovereign. We do not want European laws and judges ruling our country.” Immigration The ability to control our borders was a big consideration for some readers in the 2016 vote and in 2024 many are not convinced any progress has been made. Leave voters felt this was a crucial issue in their decision. Basil Herbert, 69, from Devon is “angry and frustrated that we are still not an independent country” and said that “we are still unable to stop mass illegal and  legal immigration  to the detriment of British people and their standard of living”. He added: “We have no politicians with the backbone to break free of Europe.” Simon Sangster, 69, from Stockport, has seen enough to change his vote from Leave to Remain in 2024, calling out “delusional right-wing lies” and says that “immigration is much worse and from areas with much less shared culture, with restricted  travel and movement rights  more serious than anticipated”. Remain voters from 2016 also expressed opinions on how immigration has been handled. George Shaw, 74, from Bury, suggests that Britain’s influence on the world stage has been “diminished” and that “the points-style immigration system introduced in January 2021 has led to a huge rise in immigration, which is contrary to what Boris Johnson and other Brexiteers predicted”. The ongoing and wide-ranging implications of Brexit today means it remains a hot topic within the comments section. In the 12 months to December 2023, the term itself was used 104,585 times, an average of 8,715 per month or 287 times a day, according to The Times’s commenting platform OpenWeb. That is almost 70 per cent more frequent than the word “Sunak”, 33 per cent than “NHS” and 27 per cent than “health”.
