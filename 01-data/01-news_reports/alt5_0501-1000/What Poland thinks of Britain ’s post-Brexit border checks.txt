   What Poland thinks of Britain’s post-Brexit border checks thetimes.co.uk April 29, 2024 Monday 1:50 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 1377 words Byline: Richard Tyler Highlight: A new regime of checks at the border take effect on Tuesday and many hauliers are worried Body   Meat has replaced car parts as Poland’s biggest import to Britain, giving the country more cause than many in the European Union to closely monitor how Britain’s post-Brexit border checks work out. Chicken, turkey, fish and ham destined for supermarkets such as Tesco and Sainsbury’s, as well as local delicacies such as dried kielbasa sausage appearing in delis represent £1.2 billion or 8.6 per cent of all goods imported by Britain from Poland, according to official figures. “You might not wander into the Polski skleps on your high street but if you are buying from the mainstream retailers there is a high probability that you will have tasted meat, fish or poultry from Poland,” said Michael Dembinski, chief adviser at the British Polish Chamber of Commerce. The volume of meat imports has increased since 2021 as Polish companies saw that Britain’s slaughterhouses were struggling to recruit staff in the wake of Brexit. Supermarkets were receptive to the pitch that Polish producers could source quality meat at more competitive prices than available from British farmers.  It means Poland’s food producers, and the logistics companies they rely on to bring their wares to Britain, have been preparing for the new border checks which take effect from Tuesday, April 30. But many are worried. Piotr Liczycki, managing director of Eljot International Transport, said his customers were realising that the additional fees and paperwork at the border made sending pallets of fresh poultry in chilled lorries to Britain unprofitable. For those sending groceries, he estimates that the cost of the new regulations will “reach up to hundreds pounds per shipment”. Small businesses struggling to fix Brexit damage to export trade Eljot, which is based in the town of Rzepin in western Poland, has prepared as much as it can for the changes, including being fully registered as a customs agent. Liczycki said: “Our first forecasts tell us that we will pay, on behalf of our customers, between £1 million and £1.5 million to the English government. Our customers are terrified. We also.” He said the uncertainty around the cost and time taken up by inspections was unsettling because the goods they ship are perishable. “[Normally] we load on Tuesday at 6pm ten pallets of fresh poultry [to go from] from Poznan to London’s Smithfield market and we deliver this shipment Wednesday evening — transit time between 30 and 33 hours.  “The market is open from midnight till 6am and deliveries are accepted by 4am at the latest. [With the border checks] we cannot deliver before 4am. The shelf life of fresh poultry products is very short — customers will not accept deliveries on Thursday. The whole situation is a very big question mark for all of us. Nobody knows how this will end.”                    Why do EU imports now face border checks?                    Since Brexit in January 2021, British producers of animal and plant-based products that export to the EU have been required to send the correct paperwork with their consignments, which are subject to inspection at the border.  Their EU counterparts have not faced a similar regime sending goods to Britain, largely because the border inspection facilities were not ready but also because of fears that the extra costs would feed through to food prices during the cost of living crisis. A separate arrangement exists in Northern Ireland to avoid a hard border with Ireland. Rules requiring the importers of animal products from the EU to provide additional safety certification came into force on January 31. Phase two starts on April 30, with physical checks at ports and inland centres for “medium risk” animal products, plants and plant products, such as meat, fish, cheese, eggs, dairy products and certain cut flowers.                    Last-minute changes                    Trade experts in Poland report that last-minute decisions on the UK side, such as the news at the start of April that the government would charge between £29 and £145 per consignment, have not gone down well.  They say the fees, as well as the additional red tape and uncertainty over border hold-ups, are likely to result in some small and medium-sized (SMEs) producers abandoning the British market to concentrate on demand within the EU. This occurred in Britain in 2021, with many small exporters to the EU ceasing to do so because it became too difficult and costly. Larger producers and their hauliers are more prepared for the changes, said Agnieszka Kisielewska, an international trade and tax partner at the law firm MDDP in Warsaw.  She remains concerned that the information has not trickled down to all companies. “I had SMEs in the logistics industry looking for the information on calls [last] week,” she said. “Overall the change is good. We need bio-security checks and we cannot skip that. But a risk management system and a well-organised approach is needed [at companies] to get through this change.  “More information could be made available to Polish businesses. The last-minute nature of the common user charge [the £29 to £145 fee] is one of the examples of how the communication process has failed.” If hauliers are stopped at the border with the wrong paperwork, it could mean retailers in Britain suddenly finding they cannot restock popular product lines because they are simply not available. Dembinski predicted “teething problems” and disruption, even for large suppliers, in the first four to six weeks of the new regime, and on an ad hoc basis afterwards. The increased uncertainty that shipments will get through the border will increase costs, he said, which will be passed on to British consumers.  But he added that Polish entrepreneurs still saw an opportunity to secure more trade with Britain. “What we have seen since the UK left the single market is an emptying of products on UK shelves that used to come from countries like Holland, Belgium, France, Spain and Denmark. Many small players in those countries have decided to no longer send their goods to the UK because it is too much hassle.”  He said Polish companies were more familiar with navigating red tape than some of their European rivals. “Twenty years ago Poland was just joining the European single market and Polish exporters had plenty of experience of dealing with obstreperous customs officials and difficult paperwork. They will still remember those days, and now there is a similar set of paperwork issues. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Polish exporters to crack the UK market. There are plenty of rich British consumers who are interested in potentially buying something. When you have the mass exodus of exporters who are no longer bothering to serve the UK, there are gaps and those Polish products hit that sweet spot of price and quality.”                    Frustration is growing with the government                    Marco Forgione, director-general at the Institute of Export & International Trade, said that despite the British border inspections being delayed five times since Brexit, too much had been left to the last minute, from the cost of the inspection fees through to which types of commodities would be subjected to different inspection rules. “Among the wider community of businesses there’s a real lack of knowledge and understanding and a degree of frustration because the communications to help them plan has not been made in a timely way,” he said. “It has created a sense that trading with the UK has become too complicated. There’s a real risk that those businesses at best pause [their exports to Britain] and some may even decide it is not worth it any more. There is also a possibility of price inflation, shrinkflation and an impact on availability.” Several government departments are involved with the new border checks. The Cabinet Office is coordinating the changes, with HMRC leading on tax matters and the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs on the border inspection posts, charges and risk assessment regime. Poland’s assessment of Britain’s handling of its borders with the EU matters because the Brexit Trade and Co-operation agreement struck by the former prime minister Boris Johnson in December 2020 is to be reviewed by the EU in 2025, under the presidency of Poland.
