   Simon Case to step down as Whitehall prepares for change at the top thetimes.co.uk June 29, 2024 Saturday 11:01 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 1510 words Byline: Gabriel Pogrund and Caroline Wheeler Highlight: Cabinet secretary will leave in January prompting a possible return for Sir Oliver Robbins -– the rising star who quit abruptly when Boris Johnson won his 2019 landslide Body   If Sir Keir Starmer becomes prime minister as expected in less than a week’s time, it will signal a changing of the guard not only within the political establishment but within the British state.  The Sunday Times can reveal that Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, is preparing to step down in January 2025, after overseeing the transition between the outgoing Conservative and incoming Labour administrations. In January this year, Case returned to work after long-term sick leave. The former spy chief and private secretary to Prince William, whose authority was undermined by his handling of the partygate scandal, is working from home at least two days a week. Insiders insist he is taking calls and fully engaged when not physically present in Whitehall.  On Thursday, he held an away day for permanent secretaries to discuss their readiness to deliver on Starmer’s “Five Missions” for government, and he has been in almost daily communication with Sue Gray, the Labour leader’s chief of staff, about the coming transition. However, he anticipates that he will quit around the start of next year, after fulfilling his desire to ensure continuity during a time of constitutional change, and having reflected on his personal circumstances.  His assessment will have been informed by his complicated relationship with Gray, a career civil servant who was entrusted with investigating unlawful gatherings in No 10 during lockdown after Case recused himself due to a Christmas event that took place in his office. Gray is said to believe she was put in an impossible situation with the inquiry, whose conclusions about a failure of leadership in No 10 were seen to confirm Boris Johnson’s assessment that she had a vendetta against him, but was called insufficient by critics.  She joined Starmer’s team last March, and will inevitably have a say on whether Case is allowed to stay on for more than half a year as he intends.  If anything illustrates the Labour leader’s intent to impose his personal authority on Whitehall and break with the Conservatives’ time in office, it is the secret and, allies insist, informal talks to have taken place in recent months between two one-time civil service heavyweights: Gray, and the man she may soon ask to run the centre of government, Sir Oliver “Olly” Robbins.  Not long ago, both of their careers looked doomed courtesy of the two B-words to have stalked politics over the past decade: Boris and Brexit. Against their wishes, they had become public figures in their own right, accused of treachery by the Tory right: Gray, the author of the partygate report; Robbins, the author of Theresa May’s doomed Brexit deal. Now, they could form a triangle with Starmer as the most powerful people in No 10, delivering his mission to revive economic growth, restore public services and reduce migration in his first term. If that takes place, it will be the most improbable return to the fore for Robbins, 49, a former Treasury and national security official who unexpectedly quit the civil service in December 2019, the month Johnson won his landslide victory, to work for Goldman Sachs.  Since last year, he has worked at Hakluyt, a Mayfair consultancy founded by a group of former MI6 spies, where his promotion from director to partner was announced last week, and where he will remain unless and until a position is confirmed.  According to sources, he has told Gray he will consider returning only if Starmer definitely wants him, and if he is deemed fit to serve after a process, for which he would submit an application. One role for which he is in contention is cabinet secretary, which currently commands a salary of about £200,000 a year. Another is the role of Downing Street permanent secretary, which has been unoccupied for two years. Those who know him believe his heart is set on a return. The man so made for the mandarinate he inherited the name “Sir Humphrey” as a PPE student at Oxford University has always believed his destiny lies in Whitehall. Unlike Liz Truss, whom he met as a student through the Reform Club, a university society promoting a federal EU, he believes deeply in the civil service. He started as a graduate trainee at the Treasury, a year before Labour’s election landslide in 1997. A former colleague said his “drinking buddies” at the department were James Bowler, today its permanent secretary, and Ciaran Martin, who became the first chief of the National Cyber Security Centre at GCHQ. Robbins remained at “HMT” for almost a decade under Gordon Brown, serving in roles covering the EU, public spending, and latterly the finances of the intelligence agencies. That made him a strong candidate to navigate the transition between New Labour’s two big beasts: in June 2006, he became principal private secretary to the then prime minister, Tony Blair, and stayed in post for Brown’s first six months or so.  How Tony Blair and Sue Gray are plotting Starmer’s path to power A long stint in the world of intelligence followed. Robbins, who is described by former colleagues as wielding a waspish sense of humour, inspiring loyal followers, but also having a bent towards secrecy, served for three years as director of finance and strategy at what his LinkedIn profile elliptically calls an “agency secondment”.  He later became deputy national security adviser to David Cameron, developing a close relationship with the civil servant who “ran Britain,” the then cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood. It was in the aftermath of Brexit that Robbins first entered the national spotlight. He was entrusted by Theresa May with running the Department for Exiting the EU, working alongside Case, the then new prime minister’s principal private secretary.  The men are reported to have “butted heads”: Robbins is said to have wanted to keep information on EU strategy within a tight circle. Case allegedly favoured a different approach and, before long, had left to become private secretary to Prince William.  In turn, Robbins returned to No 10 as May’s personal Brexit negotiator. He is said to have loathed the publicity that came with the job, but quickly acquired a profile as a consigliere, even a Rasputin-esque presence influencing the thinking of an increasingly isolated prime minister. The more unpopular her compromise form of Brexit became, the more column inches were dedicated towards him. Such headlines were untenable for Robbins, who, in the summer of 2019, once May was removed from office, went on a three-month sabbatical as an inaugural Jeremy Heywood fellow, a scheme designed to give him officials time to think “outside of the immediate responsibilities of government duties”.  Knowing there was no room for him under Johnson, he took a highly remunerative role at Goldman, then Hakluyt.  Following her appointment as Starmer’s right hand woman, Gray came calling, holding discussions about the kind of role he could play in future.  Gray is also considering Antonia Romeo, of the Ministry of Justice, recently made a dame, and Tamara Finkelstein, at Defra. The FT has previously reported that Dame Melanie Dowes, of Ofcom, and Sarah Healey, who runs the housing department, are in contention alongside Dame Sharon White, the outgoing chair of the John Lewis Partnership, Jeremy Pocklington, who runs the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and Peter Schofield, who is at the DWP. Some in Whitehall grumble that Gray and Robbins, both Whitehall institutionalists who do not naturally favour transparency, are unlikely candidates for driving through the kind of change the civil service needs — more data, more sharing, more digital innovation. Neither have run a major department. Gray was the Cabinet Office’s enforcer-in-chief, Robbins a securocrat and negotiator. One closer observer said of Robbins: “The major challenge Labour face is turning around public services with no money. His skill set is crisis, policy fixes and negotiation, not tough, grinding reform.” They pointed to his reputation for secrecy, saying: “If he wants to work very differently and trust and empower others and really lead he could be v. good. But he’d have to work against his pre-existing reputation in Whitehall. And be very different from how he was on Brexit. He can’t solve everything by writing a beautiful four-page memo and not copying it to anyone.”                     Tell a friend: our sharpest analysis is free to all                   Our politics newsletters are available to all during the election campaign, from Lara Spirit’s Red Box briefing to Tim Shipman and Harry Yorke on Sundays.
