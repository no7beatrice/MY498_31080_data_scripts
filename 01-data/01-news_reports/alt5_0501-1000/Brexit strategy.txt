   Brexit strategy The Sun (England) February 26, 2024 Monday Edition 1, Scotland  Copyright 2024 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved  Section: EDITORIAL; OPINION, LEADING ARTICLES; Pg. 10 Length: 223 words Body   HUMZA Yousaf will today again try to bring his party back to life with yet another campaign stop in Glasgow. It might not have been called yet, but make no mistake we are in election mode. The SNP leader's speech is expected to focus closely on Brexit and its impact on Scotland. And it is a fair www.target.No matter whether you think Brexit was ever truly "done", all the evidence suggests leaving the EU has been a drag on the UK economy - let's not forget we are in a technical recession. And in Scotland that extends to its impact on the Scottish economy which is desperately in need of inward migration to ensure jobs in our hospitals and on our farms are filled. But is the issue a vote winner? For so many Brexit is yesterday's issue and, like independence, divisive and tiring. Mr Yousaf will attack Labour for backing Brexit, and it is fair to say the party's position on the issue is baffling. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar had no answer when asked by the Scottish Sun before his party conference if Scotland should be a member of the EU. To claim "closer" relations would solve the problems of Brexit suggests Labour think voters will believe anything. And for a party supposedly pro-European, the failure to be honest about their beliefs masks the fear doing so will kill them at the polls. That's why the SNP smell an opportunity.
