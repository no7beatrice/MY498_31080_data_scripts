   Italian restaurants say they are struggling to cope without 'authentic' waiters and kitchen staff due to new Brexit rules - and claim their British replacements 'aren't as good' MailOnline April 10, 2024 Wednesday 5:27 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:2 Length: 1403 words Byline: Eirian Jane Prosser Body   Are you an Italian worker in the UK? Email eirian.prosser@dailymail.co.uk Italian restaurants are struggling to recruit 'authentic' waiters and kitchen staff due to new Brexit rules, with bosses claiming their British replacements aren't up to scratch.  For decades, countless young Italians have travelled to the UK each year to learn English and serve in restaurants dedicated to their homeland. But post-Brexit rules have disrupted this ritual, meaning that foreign staff have to earn at least £38,700 for a working visa - in turn causing a huge strain on the hospitality industry. The new rule will likely significantly reduce the number of Italian's living in London, according to local media in the European country, in turn affecting staffing at pasta and pizza restaurants in the UK.  And for many of these restaurants, having authentic Italian workers is fundamental, with bosses claiming those native to the Roman country are much more dedicated to hospitality work than the British teenagers taking their place. Nicola Mewitt, 35, who has been a manager at Padella in Borough High Street for a year said: 'The number of people applying from Europe in general has fallen massively. They can't come here to work anymore.  'It has been hard to find team members. I haven't been able to hire any Italian people since I have worked here. Now all of our waiters are younger British people. It doesn't feel fair to say but they aren't as good as the Italian and Spanish staff were. 'They are all living at home, so they don't really need the money or care about hospitality. They don't have any passion for it.'

'Lots of the people who left during Covid weren't able to come back. People used to be able to come here and live their lives but now they can't. It is such a shame,' she added. 'I used to love working with lots of different people from across the world and different backgrounds.  'You used to get people of different sexualities who weren't accepted in their own countries, and they would come here and be accepted. That happens a lot less now.' Today, London alone is home to up to 500,000 Italians, more than Bologna, which would make it Italy's seventh largest city by population. Despite the new rules, highly qualified Italians offered more than the new minimum salary will continue to arrive and workers can apply for a visa for jobs with a lower salary threshold if their role is on the UK Immigration Salary List. But even before the new minimum salary hike, many companies were put off hiring Italian waiters and lower-paid workers , due to the high administrative costs of obtaining a work visa for them. A family run restaurant near Borough Market called Alma's said that they have lost all their staff to the new rules and have been left to run the restaurant by themselves.  The shortages led the owners' daughter, Arilla Mlaj, having to quit her job and come back to waitress for her parents full time.  She said: 'We have no kitchen staff and no waiters anymore. The era of Italian workers in London restaurants has gone.

Staffing has been a really serious issue. I had to leave my job to come back and work at the family restaurant after Covid because there is no staff. 'It is just me and my parents and they are getting older. My mum is having health issues. If we go on holiday we have to close the restaurant because there is just no one to run it.' Domenico Quintiero, head of operations at 'O ver in Southwark, moved to England from the Amalfi Coast 12 years ago and has been working in hospitality ever since. He believes that it is crucial to have authentic Italian staff in their restaurant. He said: 'We have a sponsorship, so we can still get staff, but it is still super difficult. We have a lot of Italian staff, but it is still not enough. We are struggling to have as many as we used to. 'It is absolutely important to have people who know the products and our products come from Italy. I am all for hiring people of all nationalities, but it is hard to learn about buffalo mozzarella from someone who has never been to the country.  'We need Italian people working in Italian restaurants. Hospitality was made by Italian and Spanish people. We only have one English person working here.' Emilio Balone, 26, who is an Italian chef from the restaurant Pulia near London Bridge station agreed with this sentiment that Italian workers simply know more about Italian food. Mr Balone, who moved to England from Sicily in 2016, said: 'You can teach people about Italian food, so it is not a huge issue for us. We haven't been too badly affected by it but lots of other restaurants around here have. 'We are trying to keep that Italian touch here, but it is difficult without the produce or staff coming from Italy. 'It is much better to have Italian staff because they know about the food and can explain it to English customers. British waiters need a lot more training to understand these things.' Over at the family run Giuseppe's Max Ricciard, 53, said his restaurant does not hire a lot of new staff but believes having Italian workers is very important.                      'Little Italy': Italian migration to London                      The first Italians to arrive were merchants and businessmen from Northern Italy during the fourteenth century.  They docked in Southampton and settled in London  Over the next centuries, a steady stream of Italians arrived from different walks of life.  From the 1880s, this number grew rapidly.  This rise of fascism in Italy caused British Italian fascist groups to emerge across Britain and London.  When Italy declared war on Britain in June 1940, sparked a night of anti-Italian street rioting in the capital.  Relations improved after the war, as London needed more workers.  In 1945, an agreement was reached between the British Ministry of Labour and the Italian Government, allowing Italian migrants with permits to come to Britain through various schemes.  The manager who has been working at the restaurant for 21 years after moving from Bergamo, said: 'We are a family restaurant so we aren't looking for more people, but I have heard that it is not easy to find good workers any more. 'If you go into a Chinese restaurant, you want to see Chinese people working there. It is the same here. We have mostly Italian staff.' He said: 'After Covid we lost lots of people from other countries and they weren't able to come back because of Brexit. 'It was hard to find people for a while but it has gotten much better recently. 'We don't really think that it matters if our staff are from Italy or not as long as they are professional and they work hard.' Due to the new laws, London restaurants will now face a problem of staff shortages, as the 120,000 unfilled roles across the UK hospitality sector is expected to get worse in the future. According to recent research, more than 90 per cent of the 8,500 migrants recruited in industry last year would not qualify under the new £38,700 threshold. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said the hospitality sector has had labour shortages of between 8 and 12 per cent since coming out of Covid. She added: 'The successive tightening of the skilled worker visa means that the route from Europe to fill those skilled jobs have all but been eliminated.' Since the Romans founded the city in AD43, Italian involvement in London has always been significant, seen by the 14th-century presence of bankers from Lombardy in what is now known as Lombard Street. Italians were also responsible for introducing cafe culture to Soho after the Second World War with the opening of Bar Italia on Frith Street, before showcasing pizzas, parma ham and chianti bottles wrapped in raffia via traditional restaurants.
