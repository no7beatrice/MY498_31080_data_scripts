   Stopping UAE takeover of Telegraph ‘an absolute no-brainer’, says peer telegraph.co.uk January 31, 2024 Wednesday 4:43 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:6 Length: 6851 words Byline: By Daniel Martin, Deputy Political Editor and Dominic Penna, Political Correspondent and Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor Body   Stopping the UAE takeover of The Telegraph  is an “absolute no-brainer”, a peer said as the Government was urged to speed up its decision on the deal. During an urgent question in the House of Lords, members lined up to demand that Lucy Frazer, the Culture Secretary , and Ofcom, the broadcasting watchdog, expedite their investigations into the takeover. Lord Forsyth, the Tory peer and former Scottish secretary, said: “For goodness sake, it is an absolute no-brainer that you do not wish a national newspaper to be owned, however indirectly, by what is proposed. So why should it take so long for Ofcom and everyone else to come to the obvious conclusion and put us out of our misery?” Baroness Stowell, a former Tory leader in the Lords, urged Ms Frazer to hurry up, saying: “It seems to most people that the reasons for objecting to this deal are quite fundamental and on points of principle, not necessarily points of technicality, and it shouldn’t require a great deal of her time for her to reach her decision.” Lord Parkinson, the culture minister, said he could not comment because Ms Frazer was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. RedBird IMI , which is 75 per cent funded by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the vice president of the UAE, is attempting to take control of The Telegraph and its sister magazine The Spectator. Lord Bassam, a Labour peer, said he found himself “in the rather somewhat novel position of fiercely defending the interests of The Telegraph newspaper group and Spectator in the interest of press freedom”.  He said that on Tuesday, MPs from across the Commons had put forward “serious concerns”  about the proposed deal. “Can the minister point to any existing examples of a nation state with differing media values… acquiring a major newspaper of another country?” he asked. “And secondly, and in the light of the proposed sale, does His Majesty’s Government have any plans to review existing rules on media ownership?” Lord Parkinson replied that the Culture Secretary was “acting in a quasi-judicial capacity following the provisions laid out in the Enterprise Act 2002”. “She is considering whether mergers raise media public concerns, she has issued public interest intervention notices reflecting the concerns that she continues to have that there may be public interest considerations in this case – the accurate presentation of news and free expression of opinion,” he said. “I hope he [Lord Bassam] will understand that, as she is acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, it’s essential that she does not take into account and that there be no perception that she has or is taking into account any political or presentational considerations.” Lord Moore, a Telegraph columnist  and former Telegraph editor, asked whether national security was being considered as part of the Government’s scrutiny process. Asking Lord Parkinson about the issue he said: “Can he confirm that, when this was an auction organised by Lloyds Bank before it took its current form, that the Government stipulated there should be no more than 25 per cent maximum owned by a Middle Eastern power? “And can he also tell us whether in the investigations that are going on there is any investigation of this issue from a national security point of view?” But Lord Parkinson repeated that it was a quasi-judicial inquiry, so he could not comment. In the debate, Lady Stowell said: “The strength of feeling against this deal in the House of Commons yesterday was widespread and from all quarters of that place , and I would be surprised if there was much support in this House for the deal going ahead.  “Notwithstanding what my noble friend has said about the Secretary of State acting in a quasi-judicial capacity in considering this manner, can he nonetheless give us an indication of how soon the Secretary of State can reach her decision?” The minister replied that the Competition and Marketing Authority had been told to present its report by March 11. For the Liberal Democrats, Lord Storey asked: “When does the minister now expect to respond? And can he not expedite this? Of course cynics say he’ll now be able to do this because it’s The Telegraph. If it was The Guardian or The Independent, we’d be waiting much longer.” Last week, Ms Frazer ordered a second Ofcom investigation into the Telegraph takeover, prompted by an 11th-hour change to the corporate structure via which RedBird IMI  plans to own The Telegraph. That introduced an English limited partnership into the chain of ownership – a type of organisation in which investors such as RedBird IMI must be passive by law – in an apparent attempt to assuage the regulator’s concerns that Abu Dhabi could interfere in the running of The Telegraph.   However, such a significant change days before Ofcom had been due to deliver its report angered Ms Frazer, who viewed it as a new transaction and added six weeks to the investigation timetable.

The former first minister will give evidence for a full day as the inquiry holds hearings in Edinburgh.

Theresa Villiers, a former Northern Ireland secretary, said Downing Street must allow the “opportunity for thoughtful scrutiny” of its contents. “It is vital that there’s nothing in the deal which prevents Great Britain from diverging from EU rules,” she told The Telegraph. Sir Bill Cash, a veteran eurosceptic backbencher, said the deal contained “extraordinarily important and significant constitutional changes” that required proper scrutiny.= And Robin Millar, the leader of the 70-strong Conservative Union Research Unit group of backbenchers, warned ministers that “good law is not made in secret”. Dame Priti Patel, the home secretary, has also raised concerns over divergence.                      31 Jan 2024-04:23PM GMT                                         Good afternoon                                         Dominic Penna here, The Telegraph’s Political Correspondent, taking over from Jack to guide you through the rest of the day.                       31 Jan 2024-04:09PM GMT                                         Ex-Scottish secretary: 'Absolute no-brainer' that Telegraph takeover should be blocked                    Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, the Tory former Scottish secretary, said it was an “absolute no-brainer” that the proposed takeover of The Telegraph by an Abu Dhabi-backed investment fund should be blocked.  He told the House of Lords: “I declare an interest as, many years ago, having to make decisions as a secretary of state in a quasi-judicial capacity and I understand the difficulties the minister has got. “But for goodness’ sake, it is an absolute no-brainer that you do not wish a national newspaper to be owned by, however indirectly, by what is proposed.  “So why should it take so long for Ofcom and everyone else to come to the obvious conclusion and put us all out of our misery?” Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay, a culture minister, responded to Lord Forsyth: “Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority have functions set out under the Enterprise Act. They are carrying out those functions at the moment.  “The Secretary of State looks forward to receiving their reports by the deadline that she has set out. She will then take into account what they recommend to her.”                       31 Jan 2024-04:05PM GMT                                         Tory peer: 'Reasons for objecting to this deal are quite fundamental and points of principle'                     Baroness Stowell of Beeston, a Tory peer, said: “As the noble lord, Lord Bassam, has already alluded, the strength of feeling against this deal in the House of Commons yesterday was widespread and from all quarters of that place and I would be surprised if there was much support in this House of the deal going ahead.” She asked for an “indication as to how soon the Secretary of State can reach her decision because it seems to most people that the reasons for objecting to this deal are quite fundamental and points of principle, not necessarily points of technicality and it shouldn’t require a great deal of time for her to reach her decision.”                       31 Jan 2024-04:01PM GMT                                         Minister 'limited in what I can say while that quasi judicial process unfurls'                     Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay, a culture minister, responded to the comments made by Lord Bassam (see the post below at 15.57).  He said Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer was acting in a “quasi judicial capacity”.  He told the House of Lords: “She is considering whether mergers raise media public interest concerns. She has issued public interest intervention notices reflecting the concerns that she continues to have that there may be public interest considerations in this case...”  Lord Parkinson said he was “limited in what I can say while that quasi judicial process unfurls”.                       31 Jan 2024-03:57PM GMT                                         Labour asks if Government will review rules on media ownership                     The House of Lords is now discussing the proposed takeover of The Telegraph.  Lord Bassam of Brighton, a Labour peer and shadow culture minister, said there were “serious concerns” being raised and “put forward thoughtfully by members of all parties right across the House”.  He asked: “Can the minister point to any existing examples of a nation state with differing media values... acquiring a major newspaper of another country?  “Secondly, and in the light of the proposed sale, does His Majesty’s Government have any plans to review existing rules on media ownership and if not does the minister think they should.”                       31 Jan 2024-03:44PM GMT                                         Dublin does not anticipate EU having 'any particular difficulties' with DUP Brexit deal                    Ireland’s deputy premier Micheal Martin said he does “not anticipate any particular difficulties” from the EU in relation to the UK Government’s new Brexit deal with the DUP.  Mr Martin said: “I think the EU Commission will look at this, I think that’s the whole purpose of the joint committee and, indeed, the various mechanisms that are in the Windsor Framework is to go through issues as they arise, but I do not anticipate any particular difficulties in respect of the EU side.”                      31 Jan 2024-03:28PM GMT                                         Urgent question to be asked in Lords on sale of The Telegraph                    Peers in the House of Lords will ask questions of the Government about the proposed takeover of The Telegraph by an Abu Dhabi-backed investment fund this afternoon.  Following yesterday’s urgent question in the House of Commons, the subject will be raised in the Lords at about 3.40pm.  Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay, a culture minister, will represent the Government.  Lucy Frazer, the Culture Secretary, recently ordered a further investigation into the attempted takeover by RedBird IMI, a fund that is 75 per cent funded by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the vice president of the UAE.                      31 Jan 2024-02:56PM GMT                                         Labour rejects Tory claim of U-turn on bankers' bonuses                     Labour rejected Tory claims that it had U-turned on its position on the lifting of the cap on bankers’ bonuses (see the post below at 08.42).  A spokesman for the party said it did not view lifting the limit as a “priority” when the Tories made the change last year but would stick with the move to ensure stability for businesses. Put to her it was “quite the U-turn”, just three months after Rachel Reeves criticised the original decision, the spokeswoman said: “We don’t accept that characterisation of it. We said at the time that we didn’t think it was a priority. That decision was taken by the Government. And we don’t have any plans to bring it back.” Pressed on what has changed in the interim, the spokeswoman said Labour’s focus is “moving forward”. She added: “We don’t want to create any uncertainty and instability for business. So that’s why we’re saying that we wouldn’t reverse it.”                      31 Jan 2024-02:31PM GMT                                         DUP MP accuses Government of being ‘spineless’ in dealings with EU                     A DUP MP accused the UK Government of being “spineless” and claimed ministers had refused to “take on the EU” over its “interference” in Northern Ireland.  Sammy Wilson told the Commons this afternoon: “Despite the gains which my party leader and deputy party leader have gained in these negotiations, the fact remains that in Northern Ireland there are still EU-manned border posts being built which will create a border within our own country.  “And when the Northern Ireland Assembly sits, ministers and assembly members will be expected by law to adhere to and implement laws which are made in Brussels, which they had no say over and no ability to amend, and no ability to stop. “This is a result of this spineless, weak-kneed, Brexit-betraying Government, refusing to take on the EU and its interference in Northern Ireland.” He added: “Is Northern Ireland going to find it’s got the ability to stay tied to the United Kingdom, or will the Government proceed happily to change laws here regardless of the impact it has on Northern Ireland?” Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland Secretary, replied: “On this, the fourth anniversary of leaving the European Union, I can tell him absolutely that this agreed package of measures will not change the freedoms and powers we have secured through Brexit or through the Windsor Framework. “It will not reduce our ability to diverge nor our commitment to do so should it be in the interest of the United Kingdom.”                      31 Jan 2024-02:21PM GMT                                         Private schools 'will be forced to cut scholarships under Labour’s VAT raid'                    Private schools will be forced to cut scholarships and bursaries for the poorest students in response to Labour’s planned VAT raid, headteachers have warned.  Class sizes may also have to increase as a direct result of Sir Keir Starmer’s pledge to end the VAT exemption for fee-paying schools, which would add 20 per cent to fees.

He said many of the announcements were due to a “significant period” of negotiations between the UK Government and the DUP, as he praised the party’s leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.  “With this package it is now time for elected representatives in Northern Ireland to come together, to end the two years of impasse and start work again in the interests of the people that elected them,” he said.                       31 Jan 2024-01:39PM GMT                                         MPs to vote on DUP Brexit deal tomorrow                    MPs are expected to be given a binding vote on the Government’s new Brexit deal with the DUP tomorrow after a debate is held on the statutory instruments which will implement the changes to current GB-NI trading arrangements.                       31 Jan 2024-01:17PM GMT                                         Brexit deal means 'significant' changes, says No 10                     Downing Street said the new Brexit deal with the Democratic Unionist Party contains “significant” changes to the Windsor Framework’s operation. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “This is our negotiation between the UK and the DUP, this is not about altering the fundamentals of the Windsor Framework. We do believe the changes we are implementing are significant and the DUP have made similar comments.” Pressed on the “significant” changes, he said that they were to the “operation of the framework”. He declined to say whether talks have been held with the EU, saying he would not discuss “private conversations”. He added: “It’s important to make clear that this was a negotiation between the UK and the DUP about ensuring the framework operates properly within the UK.”                      31 Jan 2024-01:03PM GMT                                         Join the conversation                    Telegraph readers in today’s live blog comments section are weighing in on why they believe Conservatives are facing the prospect of a “complete wipeout” in Wales at the next general election.                       Alan R said: “Bring Labour on and weep but what is the alternative? In five years the electorate will hopefully have come to their senses and realise both Labour and Tories are busted flushes and a sea change is required to govern the country for the future.”                      Ian P said: “Despite some unpopular policies such as the 20 mph limit, the Labour government in Wales has done a good job. Mark Drakeford was seen during Covid as a strong sensible leader when compared to the chaotic Boris Johnson administration across the border.”                      Andrew H said: “The longer this Government continues the worse the Tories’ likely result in the next general election. Rishi Sunak is not a leader and is making an absolute mess. It is just going to get worse.”  You can join the conversation here.                       31 Jan 2024-12:57PM GMT                                         Government publishes DUP Brexit deal                     The Government has now published the deal it has done with the DUP on reducing post-Brexit trade friction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Speaking during PMQs, he said: “Housebuilding is weakening, we need to do more. Will [Mr Sunak] consider using the Budget to do as he and I did together during the pandemic and cut stamp duty to boost housing starts, to reignite the economy and to support thousands of businesses across our country?” Mr Sunak replied: “Tax decisions are a matter for the Chancellor but I would point out that our existing stamp duty relief for first time buyers ensures the vast majority of first time buyers in our country pay absolutely no stamp duty.”                       31 Jan 2024-12:29PM GMT                                         Flynn takes aim at 'shameful' Labour over bankers' bonuses stance                    Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s leader in Westminster, used his question at PMQs to take aim at the Tories and Labour over the removal of the cap on bankers’ bonuses.  Labour has now said that it would not reinstate the cap if it was in power despite criticising the move to lift it last year.  Mr Flynn said Labour’s position was “shameful” and asked Mr Sunak: “Is the Prime Minister comforted by the fact that he is now no longer alone in this House on being completely out of touch with public opinion?” Mr Sunak said: “As I said at the time, we supported the decision of the independent regulator because this was the right thing for financial stability.”                      31 Jan 2024-12:22PM GMT                                         Sunak accuses Starmer of deploying 'politics of envy'                    Rishi Sunak accused Sir Keir Starmer of deploying the “politics of envy” during a clash over mortgage payments.  Sir Keir Starmer told Mr Sunak: “He is just so out of touch it is unbelievable. Finding hundreds of pounds extra a month, that may not seem like a big deal to the Prime Minister but let me tell him, most people don’t have that sort of money knocking around.”  Mr Sunak replied: “Again, I was puzzled because again he resorts as always to the politics of envy here, but after recently and repeatedly attacking not just me but the Government for lifting the bonus cap, I was genuinely surprised to see that the shadow chancellor just today has announced that she now supports the Government’s policy on the bankers’ bonus cap.”                       31 Jan 2024-12:17PM GMT                                         Tories have 'forfeited the right to be lecturing others about the economy', claims Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer claimed the Tories had “forfeited the right to be lecturing others about the economy”. He also claimed the Tories were planning to “max out the Government’s credit card at the next Budget”.  Sir Keir said: “They say they are going to max out the Government’s credit card at the next Budget ... they have forfeited the right to be lecturing others about the economy.  “Somebody coming off a fixed rate mortgage is going to be paying an average of £240 more each and every month. A constant reminder that working people are paying the price for the damage that they’ve done to the economy.”  Rishi Sunak pointed to the steady fall in inflation in recent months and the National Insurance cut which took effect this month.  He said voters would be “better off sticking with our plan rather than going back to square one with him [Sir Keir]”.                       31 Jan 2024-12:13PM GMT                                         Labour has 'no plan' to pay for £28bn green investment plan, says Sunak                     Sir Keir Starmer claimed Rishi Sunak wanted people to be “dancing in the street and thanking him” after he cut national insurance this month but also kept in place a handful of other tax rises.  Sticking on the cost of living crisis, the Labour leader claimed the Tories had “crashed the economy”.  Mr Sunak took aim at Labour over its £28billion green investment plan. The Prime Minister said Sir Keir had “no plan to pay for this £28 billion, no plan at all”.  He said it was a case of typical Labour economics: “Keep the spending but drop the payment plan.”                       31 Jan 2024-12:09PM GMT                                         Starmer grills Sunak over cost of living crisis                     Sir Keir Starmer used his first question at Prime Minister’s Questions to ask about comments made by George Freeman, a Tory MP who said this week that he had resigned from his ministerial job partly because his salary could no longer cover his mortgage.   Referring to the cost of living crisis, the Labour leader asked if the UK had now “finally discovered what they [the Conservatives] meant when they said ‘we are all in this together’”.  Rishi Sunak pointed to the Government’s mortgage charter, rolled out last year, and said that millions of people are “benefiting from support with their mortgages”.                       31 Jan 2024-12:04PM GMT                                         Commons Speaker issues warning to MPs over behaviour in chamber                     PMQs is now underway in the House of Commons.  It started with a warning from Sir Lindsay Hoyle to MPs as he told them to show “greater self-restraint” in their behaviour in the chamber.  The Commons Speaker said there had been an “escalation in unhelpful exchanges across the floor of the House” and “some of the language used in questions has also fallen short of the standards and good temper and moderation that should characterise the proceedings of this House”. He said: “I know there is a general election approaching but I would urge [MPs] to exercise greater self-restraint in their choice of words and in their general behaviour both when they are asking a question and when they are not.” Rishi Sunak then started by talking about his new Brexit deal with the DUP.  The Prime Minister said that “after two years without an Executive there is now the prospect of power-sharing back up and running, strengthening our Union... and offering a brighter future for Northern Ireland”.                       31 Jan 2024-11:59AM GMT                                         Sunak cheered by Tory MPs ahead of PMQs                     Rishi Sunak has just entered the House of Commons and taken his seat on the government frontbench.  The Prime Minister was given a warm welcome by Tory MPs who cheered as he took his seat.

The former prime minister tweeted: “We must at all costs avoid a return to anything remotely like the disastrous ‘Chequers’ formula whereby artificial concerns about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland are used to keep the whole of the UK in alignment with EU rules.” Mr Sunak’s deal with the DUP is expected to see a reduction in post-Brexit trade checks in the Irish Sea. But some Brexiteers fear the changes could hamper UK efforts to move away from EU rules.  The agreement is expected to be published by the Government this afternoon. Four years on from Brexit we celebrate the restoration of this country’s democratic power to make its own laws and rules. With those Brexit freedoms we have introduced improved standards for animal welfare, cut taxes on sanitary products, created greater flexibility for cutting…                      31 Jan 2024-11:14AM GMT                                         'It may well be that the figure is quite low'                    The number of asylum seekers being removed to Rwanda under Rishi Sunak’s £240million scheme could be “quite low”, the Home Secretary has said James Cleverly told the Home Affairs Select Committee that the scheme remained “uncapped” with no upper limit. But he refused to give a number on how many of the 33,085 people identified as potentially eligible for removal to Kigali will be sent there. “The answer is entirely dependent on other work we’re doing in parallel,” he said. “It may well be if we’re successful with returns agreements if circumstances in other countries change, it may well be that the figure is quite low. “It could be nearly at that figure, but the point is the number of people that we might send to Rwanda is entirely contingent on a whole set of other work that we’re doing.”                      31 Jan 2024-11:13AM GMT                                         Reform UK leader marks Brexit anniversary                     Today marks the four year anniversary of the UK’s formal departure from the European Union.

Tulip Siddiq, a shadow Treasury minister, said Labour would “probably not” be supportive of a united Ireland.  Ms Siddiq said: “I think we want to stay as it is at the moment and it is a very important place for us, it is part of the UK market and that is what we are happy with.” Sky News presenter Kay Burley then asked: “So Sinn Fein, it would not be a united Ireland, they would have no support as far as Labour was concerned if you were the government of the day?”  Ms Siddiq replied: “Probably not.” The exchange comes after Sinn Fein said the reunification of Ireland is within “touching distance”.

Speaking in Belfast this morning, Micheal Martin said the Irish Government has “no issue” with streamlining and ensuring a seamless passage of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Mr Martin also paid tribute to DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, praising him for his “leadership”, saying he has opened a path to a functioning executive and assembly. “We’ll await the publication of the documents today by the British Government,” Mr Martin added. “I think it would be prudent to examine those and we will do that. The British Government and the European Union have worked hard to address many of the practical concerns about the outworking of Brexit and Northern Ireland. “We need to move forward for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland in terms of economy, in terms of jobs, in terms of public services.”                      31 Jan 2024-09:38AM GMT                                         Sunak promises pharmacy 'revolution' to cut NHS waiting lists                     Rishi Sunak has promised a pharmacy “revolution” to cut NHS waiting lists. Writing for The Telegraph , the Prime Minister, who grew up and helped out in his mother’s pharmacy in Southampton, said new powers handed to pharmacists would free up around 10 million GP appointments a year. The shake-up of pharmacy services means that, from today, patients can get treatment for seven common conditions  without needing to see a GP. Expanding pharmacy services. Ending the 8am rush to get seen. Freeing up millions of GP appointments.

Dame Andrea Leadsom, a health minister, was speaking after being asked about long-delayed new post-Brexit checks on food and drink imports come into force. She told Times Radio: “It was very clear in the Brexit discussions a long time ago now, today is the fourth anniversary of leaving the EU, it was very clear that we would be leaving the single market. “What that does mean is that there is some friction in trade. However, we also have huge trading arrangements with other countries around the world. I think (there are) 70 free trade deals that we have signed up to including being the first European signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership from where, potentially, up to half the world’s growth is going to come in the next few decades. “So there is a huge new opportunity for the UK at the same time as continuing to trade, albeit with some friction, which is the price you pay for leaving the single market and for being a sovereign state again. For me as a Brexiteer, I am still absolutely convinced that this is the right thing to do.”                      31 Jan 2024-09:04AM GMT                                         Science minister accuses Labour of 'flip flop on steroids' over bankers' bonuses                     Andrew Griffith, the science minister, accused Rachel Reeves of a “flip flop on steroids” as he responded to the shadow chancellor saying a Labour government would not reinstate the cap on bankers’ bonuses (see the post below at 08.42).  Mr Griffith also claimed “Labour’s approach to the UK’s Financial Services sector is like a dog-food lasagne: sort of looks the same and may even fool some people but you really wouldn’t prefer it!”.

Mr Flynn pointed out that Ms Reeves, the shadow chancellor, had been critical of the move to lift the cap last October.  She said at the time that the decision, taken amidst the cost of living crisis, “tells you everything you need to know about this Government”. It took Labour three months to back the Tories on this. It tells you everything you need to know about Labour. #CostOfLivingCrisis pic.twitter.com/OROfM1hwSv                      31 Jan 2024-08:49AM GMT                                         Farage warns UK faces ‘absolutely astounding cultural change’ due to immigration                    Nigel Farage said the UK faces “an absolutely astounding cultural change” in the coming years because of the large flow of people into and out of the country.  The Office for National Statistics published a population projection yesterday which suggested 13.7million people will immigrate long-term to the UK and 7.6 million will emigrate long-term from the UK between 2021 and 2036.  That gives a net migration figure of 6.1 million. Mr Farage said that will have “very, very serious” implications.  He told GB News: “They [the ONS] say that between 2021 and 2036, they estimate 13.7 million people will move to the UK long-term. And many of those that leave are people from established British families who’ve been here for generations, perhaps in some cases, centuries, that are going off to retire, work or live in other parts of the world. “It’s the issue that no one wants to talk about. But it means an absolutely astounding cultural change in our country. Many millions of people who’ve already come and millions more that will come with whom we have, historically and culturally, literally, nothing in common and I believe the implications of that, for our society are very, very serious. “I think many in Parliament and in government know it, but nobody actually dares to admit it.” 'Many millions will move here who we have nothing culturally, historically, and literally nothing in common, and I believe the implications of that for our society are very serious’The ONS has predicted that by 2036, 13.7 million people will have moved to the UK.@Nigel_Farage pic.twitter.com/dFdYdPXxJn                      31 Jan 2024-08:42AM GMT                                         Labour would not reinstate cap on bankers' bonuses, says Reeves                    A Labour government would not reinstate a cap on bankers’ bonuses, Rachel Reeves has said.  The shadow chancellor told the BBC: “The cap on bankers’ bonuses was brought in in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and that was the right thing to do to rebuild the public finances.  “But that has gone now and we don’t have any intention of bringing that back. And as chancellor of the exchequer, I would want to be a champion of a successful and thriving financial services industry in the UK.” The cap was lifted last year.                        31 Jan 2024-08:29AM GMT                                         Pictured: Nicola Sturgeon arrives at the Covid Inquiry in Edinburgh                    Nicola Sturgeon, the former first minister of Scotland, has arrived at the Covid Inquiry in Edinburgh.

A Welsh voting intention survey conducted by Redfield & Wilton Strategies between Jan 24-26 put Labour on 48 per cent of the vote and the Tories on 20 per cent.  Labour were up by one point and the Tories were down by two points when compared to the company’s previous poll conducted between Dec 10-11.  Redfield & Wilton Strategies said the 28-point margin was the largest lead it had recorded for Labour in Wales since it started its Welsh monthly tracker poll in April 2023.  Philip van Scheltinga, the firm’s director of research, told The Telegraph: “Based on this poll, which is in line with what we are seeing nationally, the Conservatives are facing the prospect of a complete wipeout in Wales. “At best, they would narrowly hold onto three seats. At worst, they could end up with zero seats. That is a real possibility. That’s down from 14 – a third of Wales’ seats-won in 2019, though worth noting that Wales as a whole will lose eight seats this year. “2019 was a real breakthrough for the Conservatives in Wales. They were just five points away from Labour overall and only a few thousand votes away from having the same number of seats as Labour. That’s all gone now.”                      31 Jan 2024-08:14AM GMT                                         Rees-Mogg: Take money off 'wet wipe' rail bosses over minimum service failures                    Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg has labelled train bosses a “bunch of wet wipes” after they failed to take action to minimise the impact of the latest wave of strike action on the nation’s railways.  The Government introduced new laws last year to allow train companies to impose minimum service level requirements during walkouts.  Members of the Aslef train drivers’ union are walking out across 16 train companies during this week but no train companies have elected to use the power to require a minimum service.   Sir Jacob, the former business secretary, said the Government should take away some of the rail industry’s subsidies if train bosses refuse to use the powers.  He told GB News that “the rail bosses are a bunch of wet wipes” and added: “I think it’s time the Government stood up more to the rail companies, and said if they don’t make use of the legislation provided to keep trains running, they should lose some of their subsidies.” Load-Date: January 31, 2024  End of Document
