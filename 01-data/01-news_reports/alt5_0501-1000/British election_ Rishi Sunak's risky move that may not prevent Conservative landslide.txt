   British election: Rishi Sunak's risky move that may not prevent Conservative landslide CE Noticias Financieras English May 26, 2024 Sunday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC.

The word adorned the lectern from which Labour leader Keir Starmer responded on Thursday to the speech that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, drenched, had delivered the day before to announce in Britain the 4th of July. A one-word slogan, which has the merit of fitting the fed-up and exasperated sentiment of the UK's 77 million people, was repeated eight times by the opposition leader. In one of YouGov's latest polls on the general election project, 58% of those polled - including more than a third of those who voted Conservative in 2019 - declared that "the time for change" had come. "Starmer is determined to be the answer to that desire of the electorate," the Guardian wrote this week. The challenge is great for both leaders. In a daring poker move, Sunak this week surprised his fellow citizens by announcing an election that everyone expected in the second half of 2024 and in which Starmer hopes to win government for his party after 14 years of conservative rule. In an address to the nation, delivered at Downing Street Gate, the seat of government, Sunak said it was "the right time for Britain to choose its future," adding that the Tories had to be trusted to lead the country in times of global instability. A statement that, however, aroused alarm among his Conservative co-religionists who, aware that the party is trailing the Labour opposition by more than 20 points, could practically disappear from the political map. Some MPs were even considering the possibility of withdrawing the Prime Minister's confidence, a procedure recognized by the statutes. To put it simply: Keir Starmer will almost certainly be the next British Prime Minister, having transformed Labour after its historic defeat five years ago. But, if the Tories' situation is so disadvantageous, why did Sunak decide to bring forward the election? Because he believes that, at the moment, the party has only one chance of winning - albeit a remote one - given the few signs of economic recovery. To his cabinet, he explained that the decline in inflation, as well as the number of illegal migrants, will reinforce the conservative message of "sticking to the plan". The problem is that the announcement came on the same day that figures showed that inflation had fallen less than expected, thus dashing hopes that an eventual reduction in interest rates could give the Conservative Party a recovery in the polls. Government sources say that Sunak, convinced that the economic situation would not improve before the autumn, i.e. in four months' time, when the elections should have been held, and that criticism of his questioned project would intensify, decided to announce the general election for July 4. Adding to the poor economic forecasts are negative figures for British consumer confidence, which have failed to return to the pre-pandemic period. "This suggests that the public is still bearing the effects of the crisis on spending power, a pattern that is repeated - it is true - in other rich countries," analyzes the Financial Times. Was the Brexit a huge mistake? That slow collapse of the economic situation did not start with the Covid pandemic, but with the Brexit. According to recent figures, since then, UK trade in goods has fallen by 10%, while it has risen by 5% in the other G7 countries. Brexit was not a one-off event. It is a process that does not end. Eight years after the referendum of June 23, 2016, four years after the UK's exit from the European Union (EU), three years after the effective exit from the European single market on January 1, 2021, new border controls have just come into force, provoking the violent reaction of small businesses, which will have to pay even more fees. "The Brexit was a weird experiment from an economic point of view. This is a country that decided to erect barriers with its main trading partner, which accounts for about half of all trade," analyzes Emily Fry of the Resolution Foundation think tank. It is true that the agreement signed with the EU avoids the return of customs duties. But it imposes heavy declarations (import and export forms, health certificates, etc.). Two and a half years later, the balance sheet shows a slow collapse of British trade. The social phenomenon that has occurred in the UK after Brexit is also rare. For while history shows that voters rarely change their minds after a referendum, British public opinion has undergone a sea change in the last two years. "Since the 52% for and 48% against vote in June 2016, the majority of the electorate has come to the conclusion that it made a huge mistake. A regret that, in numbers, is above the 20% of those who voted 'leave'," confirms Sir John Curtice, one of the main pollsters of UKiCE institute, for whom the bad economic situation has weighed much more than the former irritation caused by immigration. For the Liberal Democrat Sarah Olney, the dishonesty and lies of the Leave supporters is the first cause of this regret, while for Peter Kellner, former chairman of the polling institute YouGov, the pro-Brexit people never had any idea of what would happenwhen they won. According to party sources, in the event of a Labour victory on July 4, the new government will try to improve relations with the EU. Some talk not only of extending the current trade agreement with the bloc, but even adopting an alignment with European rules. But Labour, which opposed Brexit, has no plans, however, to attempt a new EU membership. These will, in any case, be the first general elections held in the UK in July since 1945, when Labour leader Clement Attlee won a majority of 145 seats in the House of Commons. Campaigning will also take place during the Euro 2024 soccer tournament, with polling day on the eve of the quarterfinals. The Liberal Democrats (LibDems), Britain's third largest party, are also hoping to use the occasion to expand their presence in the country. Their leader, Ed Davey, declared that the government was "totally out of step, out of excuses and out of time." For its part, the hard-right group Reform UK will try to win the votes of the right wing of the Tories. Load-Date: May 27, 2024  End of Document
