   Brian Cox fears SNP manifesto will fudge independence referendum thetimes.co.uk June 16, 2024 Sunday 11:01 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 508 words Byline: Charlotte McLaughlin, Lizzie Roberts Highlight: Succession star ‘still believes’ in an independent Scotland and says it should be part of a new federal system Body   Brian Cox has said he is “worried” that the SNP will not make securing an independence referendum a clear goal of the general election. The                     Succession                     star has been vocal about his support for Scotland breaking away from the UK and in his criticism of Brexit. Asked on BBC1’s                     Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg                     about the political parties’ manifestos, the Dundee-born actor said the SNP “could be backing away from the notion of independence” before announcing its election pledges.  He said: “I don’t know if Scotland [has] backed off but I think that it’s something that worries me, because I still … believe in independence.” Cox, 78, said if Scotland became independent it should be “part of these islands” and co-operate with the rest of the UK.  He said: “I do believe we need a new kind of system. I don’t believe in the United Kingdom — I believe that we should have a sort of united federation with these islands, that each … country should be independent, but come together to support the whole,  instead of things being dictated , as we find in Scotland [things are done] on our behalf, that we have very little say.” He referred to the Brexit referendum, in which Scotland voted to stay in Europe while most of the UK voted to leave. Cox said his “main thing is … still the demon that we don’t talk about, which is Brexit” before citing economic figures. He said: “It seems to me that we are still suffering from that and  we’ve not done anything about it . So when we talk about other things, we can’t really talk in terms of where we are because we are suffering from Brexit.” Cox said if he were a Conservative voter he would be  concerned by Nigel Farage, of Reform UK , as he claimed the parliamentary candidate for Clacton, Essex, was “really ruining that party”. He described the other manifestos that were launched last week as the “same old, same old”. “My feeling is just we need to get rid of the present government. That’s the most important thing as far as I’m concerned,” Cox said. “And I think at the moment it’s a very … I don’t know, I just wish I could be clearer about what’s going on and I’m not. “I’m not getting a sense of what’s what and who’s who. I’m getting a sense of who’s against . . . but I’m not getting enough of where we’re supposed to be going, particularly in relationship to poverty, particularly in relationship to the care of the working class, and I feel the working class [has been] a systematic sidestep for a very, very long time.” The SNP said: “As the largest political party and pro-independence party in Scotland, the SNP will continue delivering for people across the country and making the case for a better Scotland with independence. “In the face of yet more cuts to public services, Brexit and a cost of living crisis, voting SNP at the general election is a chance for people in Scotland to make their voice heard — which is why page one, line one of the SNP manifesto will read ‘vote SNP for Scotland to become an independent country’.” Load-Date: June 16, 2024  End of Document
