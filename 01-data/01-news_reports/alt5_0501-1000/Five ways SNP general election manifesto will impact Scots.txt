   Five ways SNP general election manifesto will impact Scots dailyrecord.co.uk June 19, 2024 Wednesday 12:48 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 509 words Byline: By, Andrew Quinn Highlight: The SNP focussed heavily on independence and Brexit in the document. Body                        John Swinney                     launched the SNP's general election manifesto in Edinburgh today. Independence was front and centre, as the Nationalists tried to present a different option to Labour and the Tories. He also focussed heavily on Brexit and his party's desire to return to the European Union. It comes as the SNP are predicted to lose several seats with Labour expected to pick up many of them. Here are five ways the SNP's manifesto will affect Scots.                      Two-child benefit cap                     The SNP pledged to scrap the two-child benefit cap and the rape clause. The policy limits benefits to the first two children in a family born after 2017. The manifesto said the cap has "driven thousands of families into poverty and forced women to relive the trauma of rape in order to claim the support they, and their children, need to live Scottish Labour has also said it wants to scrap the policy, but UK leader Keir Starmer has so far failed to commit to doing so.                      Waspi women                    The SNP has said it will pressure the UK Government into delivering compensation for the Waspi women. It comes after a report earlier this year said women born in the 1950s affected by changes to the state pension age are owed compensation. Labour has so far refused to commit to foroting the bill -which could be more than £10 billion.  The manifesto said the SNP would "Stand up for Waspi women by making sure the UK Government delivers full, fast and fair compensation for women who have been wronged by pension inequality."                      Tax                    The SNP called for the "full devolution of tax powers". The manifesto said this would allow them to "crack down on tax avoidance and evasion and improve the transparency of tax paid by international companies". The Nationalists also said the devolution of road tax and fuel duty "would allow us to develop a new approach to funding road travel that meets Scotland's needs."                      Brexit                     The manifesto focussed heavily on the SNP's desire to return to the EU. It branded Brexit as "a disaster for Scotland" and said it had "wiped billions of pounds from the Scottish economy, pushed up prices on food and services and hit hard our ability to fund vital public services such as the NHS." The party said it wants to reverse Brexit as this would allow free movement, easier trade and make the country safer.                      Workers' rights                    The SNP manifesto supported Labour's plans to scrap "exploitative" zero hours contracts, ban 'fire and rehire' practices, increase the minimum wage and get rid of its age bands. The document also called for the devolution of employment rights and the minimum wage. The party also wants to "take action to close the gender pay gap" and would repeal the Minimum Service Levels Bill which restricts the right to strike.
