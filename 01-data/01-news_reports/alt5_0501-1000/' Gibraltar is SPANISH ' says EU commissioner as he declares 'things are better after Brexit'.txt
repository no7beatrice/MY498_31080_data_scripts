   'Gibraltar is SPANISH' says EU commissioner as he declares 'things are better after Brexit' MailOnline April 5, 2024 Friday 5:19 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 605 words Byline: Lettice Bromovsky Body   José Manuel Albares called the remarks by Margaritis Schinas incomprehensible They were made at a breakfast briefing yesterday in the city of Seville Brtitain has been locked in talks over the future of Gibraltar since it left the EU                      Spain's foreign minister has issued an EU official with an unprecedented rebuke after he joked that Gibraltar was Spanish, amid ongoing talks with Britain over the future of the territory. José Manuel Albares called the remarks by Margaritis Schinas, a vice-president of the European Commission, which were made at a briefing yesterday in Seville, 'very unfortunate and incomprehensible'. During the meeting Schinas said in response to questions about the future of Gibraltar: 'I can more comfortably say 'Gibraltar Español' after Brexit.' Britain has been locked in talks over the status of the overseas territory - which has a land border with Spain - since Britain left the EU.  However recently discussions have stalled because Spain has insisted that the UK cede jurisdiction over Gibraltar's airport, which is on an RAF base, for an agreement to be reached.

'We have reached a formula which would mean Frontex (the EU border agency) would manage the border on behalf of the EU, overseen by Spanish officials,' Vice-Admiral Sir David Steel, the governor of Gibraltar said. 'What does 'overseen' look like? We must ensure that it doesn't stretch into sovereignty that it does not exceed what we can accept in terms of jurisdiction and control.' On the other side, Spain has accused Britain of 'quibbling' over small details, saying the UK's approach has been 'penny-wise and pound-foolish'.  Albares and Maros Sefcovic, the European Commission vice-president who is leading the Gibraltar talks, responded by issuing a joint statement criticising Schinas's words. They said: 'The negotiations between the EU and the United Kingdom regarding Gibraltar are progressing as planned.'  Speaking on Spain's state broadcaster RTVE on Thursday night, Albares said: 'I have spoken with Commissioner Schinas regarding those statements he made, which seem very unfortunate and incomprehensible to me because Commissioner Schinas is not at all involved in the dossier of the withdrawal agreement concerning Gibraltar'.

Lord Cameron, the UK foreign secretary, is expected to meet Albares and Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar's chief minister, in Brussels next week to continue the talks. In theory, Gibraltar - home to more than 32,000 people - is currently outside the EU's customs union and not under free movement rules. However, Madrid has granted a temporary exemption for workers and tourists to avoid disruption on the narrow peninsula that jets off Spain's southern coast - leaving the overseas territory in a state of limbo since Brexit. The temporary agreement could be rescinded by Spain at any time, and so the negotiations are working towards agreeing common travel between Gibraltar and the EU's Schengen zone, which would remove most border controls.
