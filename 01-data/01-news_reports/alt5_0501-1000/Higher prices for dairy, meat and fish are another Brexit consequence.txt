   Higher prices for dairy, meat and fish are another Brexit consequence The National (Scotland) April 15, 2024 Monday  Copyright 2024 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Length: 211 words Byline: Readers of The National Body   THE news that Brexit border controls coming into force later this month will cost UK businesses 2 billion and lead to higher inflation and food prices is hardly a surprise. The insurer Allianz Trade has said that new controls, which were agreed in the UK-s deal with the EU, could add 10% to import costs over the first year, with businesses charged up to 145 for each imported consignment. While the UK Government has been pledging to cut inflation, this will only serve to add to it, with dairy, meat and fish products most affected. Food prices are still 30% higher than three years ago, and this will only exacerbate that problem.

As the EU is our chief export market the UK has little choice, but the difference from pre-Brexit days is that without a seat at the table we now have no means of influencing these trade policies. I consistently challenge supporters of Brexit, which has clearly been an unmitigated disaster, to outline what the benefits are, but am sadly still waiting for answers.
