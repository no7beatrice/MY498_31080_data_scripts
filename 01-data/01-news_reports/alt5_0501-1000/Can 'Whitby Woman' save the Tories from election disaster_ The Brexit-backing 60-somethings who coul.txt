   Can 'Whitby Woman' save the Tories from election disaster? The Brexit-backing 60-somethings who could decide Rishi Sunak's fate on July 4 MailOnline May 31, 2024 Friday 1:33 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:2 Length: 1124 words Byline: James Tapsfield, Political Editor For Mailonline Body                        Rishi Sunak's hopes of avoiding electoral disaster could hang on whether the Tories can win over 'Whitby Woman'.  Pollsters believe that the verdict of a category of Brits who are female, largely in their 60s and backed Brexit will be critical on July 4. Named after the town where they are most concentrated, the group are identified as home-owners who did not go to university.  Their top concern is the NHS above the cost of living, according to think-tank More in Common. Although Labour has a massive advantage in headline polling numbers, their support is widely regarded as soft - with large proportions of voters still not having made a final decision.  Stopping these wavering voters from switching to Labour is a key goal of Tory strategists, who are targeting them relentlessly with policies and messages.  Focus groups have suggested 'Whitby Woman' is particularly receptive to Mr Sunak's argument that Britain has 'turned a corner' after Covid and spiking inflation. They are also generally unconvinced about Keir Starmer and suspicious of Labour after the Corbyn years. Spelling out the importance of the voting category earlier this week, Luke Tryl of More in Common said: 'For the Conservatives to avoid a 1997 style meltdown they need to win back some of those who voted Conservative in 2019 but now don't know who they will vote for and this group are around 70 per cent female. 'The group has an average age in the early 60s, tend to own their own home and live in a small town or suburb.  'Most don't have a degree and they tend to own their own home outright.' The pollster has pointed to a string of Tory-held seats where this category of voters are likely to be decisive. Mr Tryl pointed out that Mr Sunak's high-profile announcements on national service, pensioner tax allowances, and rip-off degrees looked tailored to the group. However, he also stressed that keeping them on board would not be enough for a Tory victory. 'Instead they are the group that makes a difference between 1997 (or worse) and a smaller scale defeat for the Tories,' Mr Tryl said.  'If Whitby woman stays home, votes Reform or switches then the Tories struggle to hit 30 per cent and a whole series of seats come into play - not just those on the map - but including e.g. North Northumberland, the Isle of Wight seats whose loss point to a meltdown result for the Tories.'  Election experts have long been fond of coming up with pithy nicknames for voters who can swing a result. In the past they have included 'Mondeo Man' and, more recently, 'Workington Man'.  There was more evidence today that the wider backdrop for the Tories is grim.  The latest YouGov tracker found the Conservatives on just 21 per cent, with Labour on 46 per cent.  The advantage was down two points overall since the beginning of the week, but the change was within the margin of error. The effective standstill will be a disappointment as high-profile policy announcements on tax cuts for pensioners and axing 'rip off' degrees received backing.  Compulsory national service was endorsed as an idea by 57 per cent of over-65s - a target group for the Tories - although by just 18 per cent of 18-24 year-olds.  Meanwhile, there are signs that Reform has gained support after a series of high-profile interventions from Nigel Farage.                       Whitby women divided - and a little mystified - to be told keys to No10 are in their handbags                      By Mark Branagan  Whitby women are divided - and a little mystified - to be told the keys to Number 10 are in their handbags. But among those wavering is Tory voter Suzanne Niman, 59, who is considering switching her vote to Labour. It is partly because she had a Zoom meeting with the Labour leader during lockdown due to her daughter being a passionate Socialist. Suzanne said: 'My husband is Tory and voted Conservative last time but I think the time my be right for a change. 'Another reason is this bringing back National Service idea which strikes me as just a gimmick. 'I believe Keir Starmer will live up to his promises. I met him on Zoom during lockdown and liked him. 'The Tories have cut everything to the bone and I think we need more public spending to help the less well-off.' Michelle Boyes, 57, voted Tory last election, voted Leave at Brexit, and has no university degree. But despite ticking many of the Whitby Woman boxes, she says she still needs convincing to vote Tory again - as her partner intends to do. She said: 'I am going to be sitting on the fence until the last minute. All politicians lie to get into power.' Nodding in agreement, partner Garry Frost, 64, said: 'I always voted Labour until Boris came along. 'I thought he was the man then it was all down hill from there. But I do think Rishi is making the best of a bad job.' Elaine Blackledge, 65, is a shop-steward's daughter and her words 'in my life it has been Labour all the way'. She continued: 'I voted Remain at Brexit. But Whitby Woman is a specific genre of person who in reality doesn't exist. 'A lot of politics are based on that. But I will not be voting Labour. I am undecided but I might not even vote. 'They are all the same and I just don't see the division any more. The Brexit vote swung it for the Tories but that won't be happening again.' Karen Spendlove, 65, said of Whitby Woman: 'That sort of thing is a load of codswallop. 'I did not vote last time. This time I am not sure. I have not made my mind up. 'Whoever gets in will have a hell of a job to do. We are worse off now than we ever have been.' She agreed 'the best thing that ever happened to Parliament was Guy Fawkes', adding: 'They should put them all on minimum wage.' Local cafe owner Helen Ingram, 59, said: 'I cannot remember the last time I voted but whenever it was I voted Tory. It was not the last election. 'I didn't vote in Brexit either. But I think I will be voting Conservative again. I just don't think Labour will do any good or make anything any better. 'I did partly agree with the National Service idea. Young ones would benefit from more skills. 'The ones who come here for jobs, a lot of them do not have a clue. It is shocking.' Mandy Walton, 53, voted Remain at the EU referendum. She is a home owner and has a degree. Although as a mother she disagrees with the plans to bring back National Service, she is planning to vote Tory again when she goes to the polls in Whitby. She said: 'I think it the main issues are the NHS and housing and money being wasted on silly projects. 'I think we are on the cusp of things becoming better. Rishi is not a speaker, he is a doer. 'But every time we are about to change things Labour convinces the masses to vote for them before it can happen. A vote for Keir Starmer will be a vote for the Left.'
