The "divergence" with the EU has allowed, for example, 36 pesticides banned in the EU-27 to continue to be used in the UK. Among them, thiamethoxam, an insecticide of the neonicotinoid family that has been shown to be highly toxic to bees.  Another of the most worrying chapters has been the plans to disregard the objectives of the EU water and habitat protection directives. In 2022, there were more than 300,000 waste discharges into rivers in England and Wales. A House of Commons report confirmed that same year that only 14% of watercourses are in "good ecological status". Air quality Air quality in British cities may suffer as a result of the "relaxation" of the maximum limits set by the European directive: 40 micrograms of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) per cubic meter, reduced to 20 by 2030. Newcastle was in fact last year awarded the title of the highest NO2 concentration on the entire continent, according to the ranking drawn up by the US company Airly.  Electronics, textile waste and food waste are three areas under review by the European Parliament, although changes to the directives are unlikely to affect the UK, which may lag behind the EU, as is already the case with battery recycling. The EU directive on industrial emissions will soon be amended to include "industrial" farms for cows, pigs and chickens, something that however is not likely to happen in the British Isles.  Following Brexit, the UK left the chemicals regulatory body, known as EU Reach, which bans substances that can be toxic to human health. Despite creating its own body, UK Reach, only two substances (the use of lead in ammunition and toxic substances in tattoos) have been banned in the UK, compared to the eight rules restricting the use of "hazardous chemicals" in the British Isles.  The Guardian's analysis was made possible by data from the European Institute for Environmental Policy (IEEP), which has tracked the "divergences" between EU and UK laws since the culmination of Brexit. British businesses and environmental organizations lament that there is no department within their own government to analyze the differences.  Despite promises of a "green Brexit" made by the then environment secretary, Michael Gove, in 2017 - a year after the EU referendum - the truth is that the trend has been to weaken most European directives or lag behind in regulation, according to the British newspaper's analysis.  "Brexit gives us more freedoms," Steve Barclay, the new Environment Secretary, has replied to the British newspaper, stressing the ground gained by the abandonment of the Community Agricultural Policy: "Our farmers can now design their work in a way that works for nature and also for the farming community."  Another chapter in which the UK has even been ahead of the curve has been climate action, with the target set at the time by Boris Johnson to reduce emissions by 68% CO2 emissions by 2030 (compared to 55% for the EU). Rishi Sunak has maintained that target, but has backtracked on other goals (such as a ban on the sale of new combustion vehicles, delayed from 2030 to 2035) and given the green light to a plan for new annual oil and gas licenses in the North Sea.  Former Environment Undersecretary Zack Goldsmith resigned last June citing Sunak's "climate apathy," also criticized by former Glasgow COP26 chairman Alok Sharma for giving up the UK's global environmental leadership. A 'skeptic' on the climate change committee. Sunak's latest controversial decision was precisely the appointment of former Brexit negotiator David Frost to head the climate change committee in the House of Lords. Frost has a reputation as a climate "skeptic" for his links with the Gobal Warming Policy Foundation think tank and for statements assuring that "seven times more people die from cold than from heat in the UK" and that a rise in temperatures in the British Isles "would be perfectly manageable".  Green Party MP Caroline Lucas has meanwhile denounced the erection of "an ideological barrier" by the Conservative Party. "This government is allergic to taking measures to protect the environment," warns Lucas. "The only thing they are interested in is to go ahead with deregulatory zeal."
