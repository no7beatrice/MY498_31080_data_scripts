   London mayor calls on Sunak government to speak openly about the damage caused by Brexit CE Noticias Financieras English January 11, 2024 Thursday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC.

And although, paradoxically, the economy of the metropolis has withstood the divorce better, its EU melancholy remains more intense. That's why the Labour mayor is a loose verse in a party that, under Keir Starmer's leadership, has made peace with the past. "I would rather not be talking about Brexit again," Sadiq Khan has told guests at the annual dinner that City Hall hosts with investors and business people in London's financial city. "But part of the job of mayor is to stand up for the city. We have to be honest. Brexit is not simply a secondary concern that we can put behind us. It is a key factor in the cost of living crisis we are suffering today and has been the cause of many lost opportunities, lost business and lost revenue, at a time when neither businesses nor individuals could afford it," Khan said. The City of London has commissioned a report on the consequences of Brexit, three years after it came into effect, from Cambridge Econometrics, a consultancy firm with which it had previously worked. The data are bleak. Not only because of the damage already caused by the divorce between London and Brussels, but also because of the projection reflected in the study for the next decade, until 2035. If in 2023 the Gross Value Added of the United Kingdom is 6% less than it would have been if it had remained in the EU, that is, about 162,000 million euros, the figure will rise to 360,000 million in 2035. If Brexit has meant 1.8 million fewer jobs across the country - 300,000 fewer in London - within a decade that loss of job opportunities will reach three million jobs. On average, each Briton will be 2,300 euros poorer in 2023 as a result of leaving the European Union. For Londoners the amount is much higher, to nearly (EURO)4,000. "Rather than dodge or avoid the issue, it is mandatory that we all have a mature and honest discussion regarding the best way forward. It is obvious that Brexit has not been good. The hard version we ended up with [with exit from the EU internal market and customs area] has weighed down our economy and pushed up the cost of living. Food is more expensive, putting more pressure on households and having a negative impact on key sectors for our success such as hospitality, construction and financial services," said Khan. Gap with the Labour Party London mayoral elections will be held next May. General elections in the UK are scheduled, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has suggested, for next fall. But while the polls are smiling on Starmer, giving an average lead of 18 percentage points to the Labour Party, Mayor Khan's forecasts are much less flattering. His popularity has deteriorated in recent years, and controversies such as the increase in the congestion charge and the expansion of the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) have reduced his chances of repeating at the helm of the city. Khan is clinging to the banner that Londoners, much more than the rest of the British people, are keeping alive: the fight against Brexit. The mayor's call for a pragmatic debate on the benefits of joining the EU's internal market or its customs area goes far beyond what Starmer has promised, who has limited himself to assuring that he will try to renegotiate the current Trade Agreement, when the review deadline opens in 2025, to try to obtain concrete improvements. Starmer is aware that the Brexit wound does not hurt as much in the north or central England, traditional Labour supporters, as in cosmopolitan London. Sixty percent of Londoners voted against leaving the EU in 2016. At a time when immigration is being used in negative terms as a political weapon and the debate revolves around how to expedite deportations of irregulars to Rwanda, Khan has called for a debate on the issue "based on evidence, not prejudice." "I am not in favor of open borders or uncontrolled immigration. But we have a serious labor shortage, and we need to be honest about what is best for this city. We need both British and foreign workers to strengthen our public services and our businesses, as well as to move the capital and the country forward," the London mayor defended.
