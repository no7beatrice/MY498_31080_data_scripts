   Brexit will see half a million fewer jobs South London Press January 26, 2024 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 MSI Media Ltd All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 16 Length: 330 words Body   I have just read the key finding from a report, by Cambridge Econometrics, that was commissioned by City Hall with support from the Greater London Authority's Economics team, to project the economic impacts of the UK's departure from the Customs Union and Single Market, in particular the impact of the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement. It highlights the adverse effects on the UK, and particularly those of us in London: The UK has 1.8million fewer jobs now that it would have been had Brexit not happened - a drop of 4.8 per cent. There are approximately 290,000 fewer jobs in London in 2023 compared to a scenario in which Brexit did not occur. There are 523,000 fewer jobs in construction nationwide, with 81,000 less in London under this scenario. There are 388,000 fewer jobs in financial services nationwide, with 92,000 less in London under this scenario. The average Briton is nearly £2,000 worse off, while the average Londoner is nearly £3,400 worse off as a result of www.Brexit.UK real Gross Value Added (GVA)- a measure of the size of the economy- is approximately £140bn less in 2023 than it would have been had the UK opted to remain in the Customs Union and Single Market - a drop of six per cent. The capital's real GVA is more than £30billion less in 2023 under this scenario. This economic damage is set to increase should the UK retain its current relationship with Europe. For example, by 2035, the UK's real GVA would be about £311billion lower (10.1 per cent) than had it not left the EU. London's real GVA would be about £63billion lower. The vast majority of Londoners voted to remain in the EU, with all the benefits of free movement, allowing us to live, work and travel across 28 countries. London Mayor Sadiq Khan is calling for a new "youth mobility" agreement with the EU - a kind of pre-Brexit-style right for young people to work and study abroad, with reciprocal rights for young Europeans here.
