   Brexit, year three: continuing uncertainty in the United Kingdom CE Noticias Financieras English December 27, 2023 Wednesday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

Brexit is behind an inflation that has taken longer to come down than in the rest of Europe, or a languid economy that still does not know whether to move forward or backward. And above all, behind a poisoned debate on irregular immigration and the Sunak government's determination to deport new arrivals to Rwanda at all costs. Three years have passed since December 24, 2020, when London and Brussels finally concluded a Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) that prevented the United Kingdom from leaving the European Union by force. The uncertainty of the new scenario did not disappear with a signature. Quite the contrary. José Sol has been based in the UK for years. His firm Spanish Ham Master, dedicated to the import and sale of acorn-fed Iberian ham and to courses and cutting demonstrations at events -some as select as the Ascot horse races or boxes in the Premier League-, has been a success. It's a small company, but it serves as an example of how most Spanish companies trading with the UK are undergoing a constant exercise in prevention and damage reduction. "For months I have had a manager already working on the new documentation that they are going to require from 2024″, explains Sol. "Day to day life overwhelms me and I can't pay attention to the paperwork, but that's why I have someone working on it," he says. Next January 31, one of the obligations that the PCA imposed on the parties will finally come into force: sanitary and phytosanitary controls on agricultural and livestock products traveling to either side of the Channel. The EU immediately applied them to all products coming from the island. The United Kingdom has already delayed the entry into force of these controls up to five times, aware of the chaos it could cause to its importers, and above all because of the fear that the products in the shopping basket, already inflated this year by runaway inflation, would skyrocket. Sources at the Spanish Economic and Commercial Office in London point out that what happens in just over a month's time will be extremely important when it comes to checking, once again, whether or not the obstacles created by Brexit can be overcome. The British government unveiled its new Border Target Operating Model at the end of August, a seemingly more streamlined method of carrying out security and health checks on imports and exports, including smart stamps and GPS trackers on many goods. The new controls will be rolled out in phases over the next year. From January 31, health certificates for medium-risk animal and plant products from the EU will be introduced. It will not be until April 30 - if the announced deadlines are finally met - when British customs officials will begin to carry out physical and identity checks on many of these products, together with the importer's demand for the mandatory documents. Finally, it will not be until October 31 when all the security declarations imposed by the Brexit Trade Agreement will finally be claimed at customs. More difficult every year "Until now, EU companies have been able to ship goods to the UK in the same way as they did before Brexit. From next year that is going to change, and we could be faced with serious disruption again," warns Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). "Rules and regulation are never going to be static. Both the EU and the UK are going to put in place significant changes over the next few years, all of which can have big impacts. We will need to be flexible to keep the impact of these alterations to a minimum, because it is in no one's interest for the trading relationship between the two blocs to be further damaged," warns Haviland. The BCC has carried out a very extensive study, consulting more than 730 small and medium-sized companies, on the impact of Brexit, three years after it came into force. The conclusions are not optimistic. Some 60% of firms believe that trading with the EU is more complicated and difficult today than it was a year ago. Half of them, 49%, disagree with the idea advocated by the Conservative government that leaving the European club would help boost sales. "We have found that the UK has experienced a very significant contraction in its trading capacity, in terms of the range of products exported to the EU since the trade deal came into force. We estimate a loss of between 20% and 42% of exported varieties in the first fifteen months alone," asserts the report on the impact of Brexit by economist Jun Du for Aston Business School and cited in the BCC study. Waiting for Labour Alongside the new sanitary and phytosanitary controls scheduled for 2024, British businesses face other equally onerous changes. The EU has started to implement the Border Carbon Adjustment Mechanism in a transitional phase from October. UK exporting companies will be obliged to report the greenhouse gas emissions incorporated during the production of their products. And there will be new taxes from January 2026. The BCC has also found through its survey that almost 87% of businesses surveyed were unaware of the EU's new VAT rules. "If you are a chef living in the UK and teaching EU students, even virtually, you will have to pay VAT in the state where your customers live from January 2025," explains William Bain, director of Trade Policy at the BCC. The trade agreement signed between London and Brussels provides for a review of its clauses from 2025. The leader of the Labour opposition, Keir Starmer, has promised a renegotiation with the EU if he comes to government. General elections are due to be held later this year, and all polls point to a possible Labour victory. The EU institutions, however, have already made it clear that they have little appetite for reopening a treaty that cost blood, sweat and tears to bring forward. Paradoxically, on the mainland side of the English Channel the page has already been turned -Get Brexit Done- while on the island Brexit remains a source of constant uncertainty.
