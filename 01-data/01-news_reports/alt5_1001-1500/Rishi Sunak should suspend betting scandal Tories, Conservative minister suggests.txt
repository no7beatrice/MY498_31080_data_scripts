   Rishi Sunak should suspend betting scandal Tories, Conservative minister suggests telegraph.co.uk June 24, 2024 Monday 10:02 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:2 Length: 14732 words Byline: By Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor and Genevieve Holl-Allen, Political Reporter and Amy Gibbons, Political Correspondent Body   Rishi Sunak should suspend any Tories who placed bets on the general election date, a Government minister has suggested. Steve Baker, the Northern Ireland minister, said if it were up to him, anyone who admitted to gambling on the timing of the ballot would be temporarily kicked out of the party. He said it was for the Prime Minister to explain why he hadn’t taken any action to date, adding he had “no inside information” on Mr Sunak’s reasoning. It will pile further pressure on the Prime Minister to suspend those caught up in the scandal, with Craig Williams, a Tory candidate and one of his closest aides, having already admitted to putting “a flutter” on the general election some weeks ago. He now faces an inquiry by the Gambling Commission. Laura Saunders, another Conservative candidate, and her husband Tony Lee, the party’s director of campaigning, are also being investigated by the watchdog over alleged betting on the election date. Speaking to ITV’s Peston on Monday night, Mr Baker said: “If they placed bets it was disreputable and I would call them up and ask them, did you do it? And if they did it, then they are suspended.” He added: “But the Prime Minister would have to answer why he hasn’t done it, I haven’t got inside information on why the Prime Minister hasn’t done it.” Tobias Ellwood, the former Tory defence minister, also argued on Monday that Mr Sunak should have suspended the Conservative candidates caught up in the betting scandal. Asked if the Prime Minister should have taken that action, he told the BBC: “Given the scale of this as we see now and the potential for this story to continue to eclipse, to overshadow the election, I would now agree. “I am not sure anyone, including the Prime Minister, could have predicted the number of people involved when this story first broke. The public want to see clear, robust action now. “The practical dilemma you face, though, is were individuals responding to the whirlwind of the rumour mill around Westminster at the time… about a pending election announcement, or were they in the room when the decision was made? “If it was the latter, the party can take immediate action. Otherwise it is for the Gambling Commission to rightly make that judgement.” On Monday, Mr Sunak, who has ordered an internal inquiry to run separately to the Gambling Commission’s investigation, said he was “incredibly angry when I learned about the allegations, as everybody would be when they would hear about something like that”. He said he was not aware of any other Tory candidates being investigated but stressed that any internal inquiries by the Conservative Party must not “compromise the integrity of… police and other investigations”. Meanwhile, Sir Iain Duncan-Smith said that he was “opposed to people associated with politics betting on political outcomes in general”. The former Tory leader told The Guardian: “You can either do it by the party saying it won’t be tolerated, or you could do it by legislation. If you start relying on legislation, it would be a complex process. “Parties are capable of saying that anyone who does this shouldn’t be in the party. They can move quicker than governments.” He added: “But one way or the other, it needs to be made clear that the public takes a dim view of it and it shouldn’t happen. It’s a matter for the next parliament.”                      24 Jun 2024-09:02PM GMT                                         That’s all for today...                    Thanks for following today’s election liveblog. My colleague Jack Maidment will be back tomorrow morning to bring you the latest.                      24 Jun 2024-08:48PM GMT                                         Commentator Katie Hopkins attends Reform UK event                    Controversial Right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins has attended a Reform UK campaign event in Newton Abbot. Ms Hopkins said in a video on X that there had been “lovely happy hopeful crowds” at the Reform event. She said: “There is a lot of young people here and I’ve met them personally. And this is what politics should be like. Ordinary people getting together, having a lovely time and having a conversation. Well done to everybody from Reform.” Ms Hopkins had been permanently banned from Twitter in 2020 for what Twitter said was a violation of its hateful conduct policy, but was reinstated last year. She previously posted claims that a photo showing the body of a Syrian child on a Turkish beach was staged and also tweeted “we need a final solution” after the Manchester bombings.                      24 Jun 2024-08:23PM GMT                                         Nigel Farage claims children’s minds are being ‘poisoned at school and university’                    Nigel Farage has said children’s minds are being “poisoned at school”. Speaking at a rally in Devon, the Reform UK leader said: “My commitment to you is that I’m (going to be a part of Reform) for at least the next five years. “I believe we can get millions of people signed up to this movement, millions of people that want British values to be re-established.” He added: “Millions of people who don’t want our kids being poisoned at school and university, being told our country is the worst country that ever existed.”                      24 Jun 2024-07:54PM GMT                                         Sir Ed Davey suggests he would back a total ban on politicians making political bets                    Sir Ed Davey has suggested that he would support a total ban on politicians betting on political outcomes. The Liberal Democrat leader has said that the question of politicians making political bets should be looked at “robustly”. He told Channel 5: “Let’s follow the good process and look at all the details. Footballers are back from betting, sports people are, people in the city where they have insider trading, it’s called.  “People shouldn’t make profits on things where they have the knowledge that something’s going to happen. If you know something’s going to happen, you shouldn’t be allowed to bet on it, it’s immoral right?  “There may be other circumstances, if you don’t know the outcome of an election, I mean, everyone bets on the outcomes of elections, and maybe that’s okay.  “But I’m happy for it to be looked at and looked at robustly and if that means that politicians can’t bet on politics at all well then I’d be happy to go with that.”                      24 Jun 2024-07:40PM GMT                                         Farage: ‘Nothing to stop’ Reform UK winning seats in the South West                    Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has said there is nothing stopping his party from winning “a couple of seats” in the General Election. Mr Farage told a rally in Devon that Reform is “on the up” and while he expects Labour to win, his party was “live in second position”. He said: “Many of these seats (in the West Country) will be decided in Devon and elsewhere by literally a couple of hundred votes either way and I think you’re gonna find we’re in the mix. “There’s nothing to stop us winning a couple of these seats. “But to do it, we’re going to need to maintain that momentum, we need to maintain that conversation.”                      24 Jun 2024-07:23PM GMT                                         ‘Pub bore’ Farage wrong on Ukraine, says minister                    Chris Heaton-Harris has attacked Nigel Farage for being a “pub bore” after the Reform UK leader doubled down on his belief that Nato expansion led to the war in Ukraine,Tim Sigsworth writes. Speaking at The Sun after the Never Mind The Ballots leaders’ special, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland told The Telegraph: “Boris is absolutely right on this. “And I think Boris can actually demonstrate his support for the people in Ukraine, for the Government of Ukraine, for President Zelensky because his government stood up for Ukraine. “Tonight we had Keir Starmer basically saying Boris made all the right calls. So I think maybe Nigel has become a bit of a pub bore on this.”                      24 Jun 2024-07:22PM GMT                                         Lord Kinnock: ‘I wish I’d been fighting this lot’ of Tories                    Lord Kinnock has said that he wished he had “been fighting this lot” during his political career. The former Labour leader praised Tories who he had fought at elections in the 1980s as being “smart guys” and “fundamentally decent people”, but that it had “all changed”. He told LBC: “I wish I’d been fighting this lot. Oh, god. No John Major, no Heseltine, no Geoffrey Howe. I mean, the thing is even though they were obviously my opponents and so on, smart guys, fundamentally decent people and patriots. He added: “I mean that’s all changed. And the Conservatives I know and respect, they didn’t have to be my friends, but there are people that I know and respect are despairing at the, can you be superficial and hollow at the same time? Yeah, I know they are. I wouldn’t swap places with them and I actually wouldn’t wish that on my most bloodthirsty enemies.”                      24 Jun 2024-07:10PM GMT                                         Pictured: Farage at rally in Newton Abbot                                         24 Jun 2024-06:53PM GMT                                         Keegan ‘very confident’ no cabinet ministers bet on election                    Gillian Keegan has said she is “very confident” that no cabinet ministers bet on the date of the general election,Tim Sigsworth writes. Speaking in the spin room after The Sun’s Never Mind The Ballots leaders’ special, the Education Secretary said: “I’m very confident.” Asked why no Tory members or officials have yet been suspended in connection with the scandal, she said: “To be fair, those things. I mean hopefully they can be done quite quickly. I don’t know what the timescales are. “But to be fair you do need to allow people to have due process and that will actually be determining what follows, what actions need to be taken.”                      24 Jun 2024-06:44PM GMT                                         Greens leader: We’re ‘honest’ that our carbon tax plans will make some activities cost more                    The Green Party’s plans for a carbon tax “will mean that certain activities will cost more”, the co-leader of the Green Party has said. She told ITV: “We’re honest about the fact that it will mean that certain activities will cost more, but it will move that that greening of the economy faster, and it’ll be counter-balanced by lots of other changes that we’re making to the economy and the tax system that will make people better off overall.” She added: “We’re not afraid to talk about how we would raise that. So it’s about changes to the tax system that would move the onus from those on lower incomes who can’t afford to pay very much towards those with the broader shoulders who absolutely can.”                      24 Jun 2024-06:39PM GMT                                         Farage on Marine Le Pen: ‘Going to be the next French President, thumbs up’                    Nigel Farage has given the “thumbs up” to Marine Le Pen and declared she will be the next French President. Mr Farage was asked to give a thumbs up or thumbs down judgement for a selection of political leaders in an interview with ITV. He said of Ms Le Pen, the leader of the National Rally party in France: “Going to be the next French President, thumbs up”. He said of Emmanuel Macron: “Oh, huge thumbs down”. He also said of Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni “love her” and of Vladimir Putin: “No, not a nice guy.”                      24 Jun 2024-06:34PM GMT                                         Tories cannot attack Labour on women’s rights, says Phillipson                    It is not right for the Conservatives to attack Labour’s stance on transgender issues because of their “record” on women’s rights, Bridget Phillipson has said. Asked in The Sun’s spin room about JK Rowling’s accusation that Sir Keir Starmer had “abandoned” women, the Education Secretary said preserving single-sex spaces was “incredibly important” but that the Tories did not have a good “record” on women’s rights. “They can talk about this all they like,” she said. “Their record is entirely at odds with the reality for women out there.”                      24 Jun 2024-06:30PM GMT                                         Nigel Farage: My comment about Sunak and D-Day was ‘purely about class’                    Nigel Farage has insisted that his comment that Rishi Sunak did not understand “our culture” when he left D-Day early was “purely about class”. Asked if he had an issue with people speaking different languages and people of other ethnicities, he said: “I have a huge problem with people coming to Britain and not assimilating, maintaining their own languages, not mixing in communities, that is a disaster.  “My comment about Mr Sunak was about class, purely about class.”                      24 Jun 2024-06:27PM GMT                                         NHS needs a ‘rethink’, says Farage                    Nigel Farage has said that there needs to be a “rethink” on the NHS. He told ITV: “What’s the NHS for? Ever since the late 1940s it was for healthcare being free at the point of delivery. And I absolutely, subscribe 100 per cent to that, as to how we get there, we’re spending ever more and we’re getting less out in terms of delivery.  “At the other end, I’m just saying, let’s have a rethink.”                      24 Jun 2024-06:18PM GMT                                         Labour rejects Sunak’s claim he will be proven right on Starmer’s economic competence                    Labour has rejected a claim by Rishi Sunak that he will be proven right in arguing that Sir Keir Starmer cannot be trusted on the economy, just as he was about Liz Truss,Tim Sigsworth writes. Speaking in the spin room after The Sun’s Never Mind The Ballots leaders’ special, a party spokesman said: “We’ve seen Rishi Sunak get more and more desperate during the course of this campaign. “It has now been repeatedly proven that his assertions about what Labour would do if we were lucky enough to get into government are completely untrue, and not based on any policies or proposals that we’ve actually put forward. “And so, you know, I think the public can frankly see through it for what it is, which is the desperation of the Tory campaign because they haven’t got a record to stand on, and they haven’t got a positive offer for the future.”                      24 Jun 2024-06:13PM GMT                                         Labour would prioritise ‘environmental dogma’, says Sunak                    Rishi Sunak claimed Labour would prioritise “environmental dogma” over Britain’s national security and the cost of living. He also said Sir Keir Starmer’s party does not understand that “sex means biological sex”. He urged people: “Don’t surrender to Labour”, adding: “Let’s go out and smash it everyone.”                      24 Jun 2024-06:10PM GMT                                         Sunak tells supporters: ‘Don’t surrender to Labour’                    Rishi Sunak has told supporters not to “surrender to Labour”. In a campaign event in London, he said: “Don’t surrender to Labour. Fight for every vote, fight for our values, fight for our vision of Britain, because it is only us Conservatives that can deliver the secure future that our country needs and our country deserves.  “So let’s get out there and smash it everyone.”                      24 Jun 2024-06:08PM GMT                                         Sunak: We have 10 days to save Britain                    Rishi Sunak opened his speech by warning Tory supporters “we have 10 days to save Britain from a Labour government”. He said he is not “blind” to people’s frustrations with him and the Conservative Party. But he said this is “not a by-election” or a “referendum on me”. He urged people to think about what a Labour government would mean for them and their family. Mr Sunak also accused Sir Keir Starmer of “U-turning on his U-turning” on his support for Jeremy Corbyn.                      24 Jun 2024-06:00PM GMT                                         Farage and Denyer to be interviewed on ITV                    Nigel Farage and Carla Denyer will shortly be interviewed on ITV for Reform UK and the Green Party. The pre-recorded interviews will see the leader of Reform and the Greens co-leader be grilled by Harry Horton and Rachel Younger.                      24 Jun 2024-05:56PM GMT                                         Backlog of asylum claims would double by the end of the year if the Tories are re-elected, says Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer said that the backlog of asylum claims would double by the end of the year to 100,000 if the Conservatives are re-elected. “There are 50,000 people not being processed, if we carry on with Rishi Sunak as prime minister it will get to 100k by the end of the year,” the Labour leader said. He said it was “outrageous” to pay hotel bills to accommodate those people not being processed.                      24 Jun 2024-05:42PM GMT                                         Starmer: I would ‘welcome’ a discussion with JK Rowling on women’s rights                    Sir Keir Starmer has said that he would “welcome” a discussion with JK Rowling over women’s rights and trans issues. The author and campaigner this weekend said that Labour had “abandoned” women and that she would struggle to vote for them. Asked whether Labour would meet with Rowling to discuss trans issues, Sir Keir said: “Of course, of course I’d meet with her. Of course I would.” He added: “She’s made some really important points. I’d welcome that discussion, because I do think that we’ve made huge progress on women’s rights under Labour governments, and equality, massive progress. There’s more work to be done if we are privileged to come in to serve this country and I want to make sure that we can bring people together.”                      24 Jun 2024-05:34PM GMT                                         Starmer: I understand it’s hard for some parents to send their children to private school                    Sir Keir Starmer said that he “completely” understands that it is “quite hard” for some parents to send their children to private school. He told The Sun: “I accept that many families, parents work hard and save hard to send their children to private school because they’ve got aspirations for their children and they think that’s the best place for their child.  “I’ve got nothing against that, nothing against private schools, and I completely understand that for some parents, that’s quite hard to do because there’s not all the money going around.” He added: “But I genuinely believe that every single parent has aspirations for their children across the whole country, including every single parent who sends their children to state school.”                      24 Jun 2024-05:30PM GMT                                         I could guess what Starmer will say next, says Heaton-Harris                    Chris Heaton-Harris has joked that he could guess what Sir Keir Starmer is “going to say and say it for him”, writes Tim Sigsworth. The secretary of state for Northern Ireland, who is watching the debate in the spin room with journalists, made the jibe as the stream showing the programme buffered. “I could guess what he’s going to say and say it for him,” Mr Heaton-Harris said.                      24 Jun 2024-05:28PM GMT                                         Pictured: Sir Keir Starmer on The Sun’s ‘Election Showdown’                                         24 Jun 2024-05:26PM GMT                                         Labour will not reverse Brexit but ‘we can do more on defence and security’, says Starmer                    Labour will not reverse Brexit, but the UK got a “very botched deal”, Sir Keir Starmer has said. He told The Sun that Labour would not reverse Brexit, but added: “If you talk to any business that’s trying to trade, they will tell you it’s not good enough.  “I think we can do more on defence and security, by the way, with our European partners, but we’re not going back in. We’re not going back into the Single Market, the Customs Union. We’re not going back to freedom of movement. “                      24 Jun 2024-05:22PM GMT                                         Starmer: I ensured Labour ‘never veered on fundamentally important things’ under Jeremy Corbyn                    Sir Keir Starmer has said that he stayed in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet because he ensured Labour “never veered from its position on things that were fundamentally important, like Nato”. Challenged over his historic support for his predecessor, he said: “I didn’t vote for Jeremy Corbyn to be leader of our party in 2015, I didn’t vote for him to become leader. In 2016, I supported other candidates, but our membership returned him as the leader. But that was very difficult for me and for our party, because I thought that we were not going to be heading in the right direction. Everybody then took a decision about what they did, how we dealt with this.  He added: “I felt that on issues such as Brexit, which I thought were going to define us for decades to come, leaders are temporary, but political parties are permanent.  “But it was important to have a voice in the shadow cabinet, and it meant that I could challenge on anti-Semitism, and it meant that the Labour Party never veered from its position on things that were fundamentally important, like Nato.” He said that he had “reflected” on his time serving in Mr Corbyn’s shadow Cabinet, he said: “ I think it was right to fight, I think, in my case it was right to fight from within the Shadow Cabinet”                      24 Jun 2024-05:17PM GMT                                         Starmer: No Labour leader ‘has ever done anything as serious’ to change the Labour Party                    Sir Keir Starmer has said that “no Labour leader has ever done anything as serious” as expelling Jeremy Corbyn from the Labour Party. He told The Sun: “Look at my leadership on this. I picked up the Labour Party, I recognised many people had not voted for us last time, possibly people in this room and I said, ‘we’re never going to put that proposition in front of the electorate again. I’m not going to tell to the electorate, what do you think you’re doing?’ I’m going to say to my party, we need to shake this up and change it. “So I’ve changed the Labour Party, so there’s a fundamentally different choice at this election. And Jeremy Corbyn not only lost the whip as a Labour MP, he’s now been expelled from the Labour Party. No Labour leader has ever done anything as serious as that about changing his or her party before. He added: “I’ve changed it, and now I hope that there is a Labour Party which people feel that they can vote for this time in a way which I accept wasn’t the case last time around.”                       24 Jun 2024-05:13PM GMT                                         Starmer praises Boris Johnson for ‘strong position’ on Ukraine                    Sir Keir Starmer has praised Boris Johnson for taking a “strong position” on Ukraine. He criticised the former prime minister for his behaviour on Partygate, but added: “To be fair on Ukraine, he took a strong position”. He added: “I was leader of the opposition, and I said, we will support the government. And so there’s been unity in parliament from the outbreak of that conflict and Russia aggression there.  “And I thought that was important, Boris Johnson thought it was important, because I think we both took the view that the only winner, if there was a split in our politics here in the UK, would be Putin. He wanted to see division in other countries, and we didn’t allow him.”                      24 Jun 2024-05:09PM GMT                                         Sunak: I was right about Liz Truss so you can trust me on Sir Keir Starmer                    Rishi Sunak has said that voters can trust what he says about Sir Keir Starmer because he was right to warn about Liz Truss’s plans for the economy. The Prime Minister ran against Ms Truss to become Tory leader and lost to her in the summer 2022 leadership election. Rishi Sunak told The Sun: “I spent a summer a couple of summers’ ago saying that what Liz Truss was proposing was wrong, and I was behind. And everyone said to me, ‘why are you bothering? Why are you still talking about this? No one wants to hear what you have to say.’ I kept talking about it every day of that because I believed in what I was saying.” He added: “I was right then when I warned about Liz Truss, and that’s why all of you can trust me now, when I also warn about the damage that Keir Starmer would do to our economy.” He told voters: “And I’m telling you again now, all seems a bit familiar. If Keir Starmer is your Prime Minister, the economy is going to suffer, and all of you are going to suffer. I don’t want to see that happen.

The woman told the Prime Minister that her family has been through “18 months of hell” and that they felt “let down”. Mr Sunak told her: “One of the ways we’re doing that is by rolling out things called community diagnostic centres. So we’ve done 160 and if we’re re-elected, we’ll do many more. And these are units in your local community where you can get all your checks, tests and scans done, and that way, get your diagnosis much quicker.  “We’re hiring more oncologists, we’re using technology as well and new forms of testing to identify things, but fundamentally, what happened to you and your family isn’t acceptable. I can only apologise. The challenges we’re dealing with with Covid, cancer in particular, was one where for two years, lots of people didn’t present with symptoms, and we’re catching up with that now, and that’s an awful tragedy.” Asked whose responsibility it was that NHS waiting lists had soared, he said: “It’s my responsibility, because I’m the one in charge, and I’ve been very clear, we haven’t made as much progress on waiting lists as I would have liked.”                      24 Jun 2024-04:49PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak refused to say whose ‘fault’ it is that migration is ‘too high’                    Rishi Sunak has refused to say whose fault it is that net migration is “too high”. Asked whose fault the level of migration into the UK was, he said on three occasions “the numbers were too high”.  He told The Sun: “I’ve got that.

He told The Sun: “I want people to know where I stand. I think illegal migration is unfair. I don’t think it’s right that people come to our country illegally, and I want to do everything I can to stop it.” “Let’s be clear, right over the last 12 months, the numbers are lower than they were, this year, already, a full year, it’s down on the year before.  “But I’m being clear, we haven’t got the job done. The only way to do that is to make sure that we make it clear that to come to our country illegally, you won’t get to stay. You’ll be removed.”                      24 Jun 2024-04:41PM GMT                                         It’s not right to say we haven’t made progress in 14 years, insists Sunak                    Rishi Sunak has insisted that it is “not right” to say that the UK has not made any progress in 14 years. The Prime Minister told The Sun: “I don’t think it’s right to say that we haven’t made progress in 14 years, I simply don’t believe that.” He added: “And if you look at 14 years, what the Conservatives have done, we’ve ensured that our school children in this country, in England, are not just the best readers in the United Kingdom, they’re best readers in the Western world. He added: “So yes, of course, not everything is perfect. Of course, we haven’t made as much progress as we would have liked to in some areas, but it’s just simply not right to say that the record of the last 14 years is one where we haven’t made progress.”                      24 Jun 2024-04:37PM GMT                                         Sunak: ‘We won’t hesitate to act’ on findings of our internal investigation into election bets                    Rishi Sunak has said that he will not “hesitate to act on information or findings that come to light” in the internal party investigation into the allegations of betting on the election date. He told The Sun: “The Gambling Commission, who are investigating this, as well as the police, obviously, are independent of me, of Government. I don’t have access to the details of their investigation. They don’t report to me.  “But what I can tell you is, in parallel, we have been conducting internal inquiries of our own into the situation, and won’t hesitate to act on information or findings that come to light.” He added: “I want to reassure people we are in parallel and have been conducting internal inquiries and won’t hesitate to act if findings or information comes to light. And I’ve been crystal clear, if anyone has broken the rules then they should face not just the full consequences of the law, but they will be booted out of the Conservative Party.”                      24 Jun 2024-04:26PM GMT                                         Clegg accuses Starmer of ‘peculiar rewriting of recent history’                    Sir Nick Clegg has accused Sir Keir Starmer of a “peculiar rewriting of recent history”, after the Labour leader said that low growth “started well before Brexit”. The former deputy prime minister has called for Labour to be “bold” about its growth plans, and claimed that the “tinkering around the edges with the EU as currently proposed is not enough”. It comes after Sir Keir Starmer said that “the problem with low growth, which has been at the heart of the economic problem in this country for 14 years, started well before Brexit”. Sir Nick, now President of Global Affairs at Meta, wrote: “For the country’s sake I hope Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves succeed in restoring growth to the British economy. But ruling out even the option of joining the EU’s Customs Union, on the basis that ‘low growth, which has been at the heart of the economic problem in this country for 14 years, started well before Brexit’, is a peculiar rewriting of recent history.”                      24 Jun 2024-04:14PM GMT                                         Sunak and Starmer to face grilling on The Sun’s ‘Election Showdown’                    Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are shortly going head to head on The Sun’s “Election Showdown”.

The Labour leader told the Big Issue: “I’d offer to pay it. The desperation of families around the country should make the Tories feel nothing but shame. “Of course, shoplifting is a problem for businesses, so we’d have 13,000 more neighbourhood police to provide reassurance on our high streets.  “But we’d also change the rules so people could use food bank vouchers and loyalty card points to buy baby formula.” Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak said he would not, telling the magazine: “Shoplifting is not a victimless crime and we’ll always support shopkeepers to prevent theft. At the same time, we will continue to help parents with the cost of living.”                      24 Jun 2024-03:36PM GMT                                         Former Tory minister says she would not campaign for Tory candidates under investigation                    A former Conservative minister has said that she would not campaign on behalf of Tory candidates who are under investigation for betting on the general election date.

I love it. There’s no better job. “It is a lot easier and a lot less pressured than being prime minister. The fact of the matter is, I stood and I lost. And what terrifies me now is not not becoming leader, it is seeing Labour come in.” She continued: “This is one of the things that I’ve found most difficult doing this job, that people tend not to know what it is, because I’m always asked the leadership question. We’re so interested in the personalities, in the gossip and so on… “We need to focus on this election. The choice is going to be between us or between them. Be afraid if it is them, is all I would say.

Paul Johnson, IFS director, said earlier today that both the Conservative and Labour manifestos “essentially ignore” some of the “big challenges” in the economy. Facing questions about the analysis, the Prime Minister said: “No, I don’t agree with that. We have a fully costed manifesto which can deliver tax cuts for people at every stage in their lives and that is largely funded by making sure that we can find some savings in the growth of the welfare budget, because it’s been growing at unsustainable levels since the pandemic. “We’ve set out a very clear plan to reform that, to support people into work, and in fact, the IFS acknowledge that last time around they said that that wasn’t possible, that it was actually delivered, and that’s something that the IFS themselves have said. “Labour in contrast don’t think you can save a single penny from the welfare bill, which is already where we’re spending more than on transport, schools, law enforcement. I don’t think that’s right. I want to deliver tax cuts for people and constraining the increase in the welfare budget is the right way to do that to support people in work.”                      24 Jun 2024-11:49AM GMT                                         Farage: Labour would be ‘even more incompetent’ than the Tories                    Nigel Farage claimed a Labour government would be “even more incompetent than the Conservatives”.

They will prove to be, if it is possible, even more incompetent than the Conservatives have been.  “And as he tries to take us back to EU rules, as we get more lunacy on trans laws and everything else, you will find a government and a Parliament split from its people.  “So my ambition is for us to establish a bridgehead in Parliament on July 4 and over the course of the next five years to build up a mass movement for common sense, for decency, to represent the silent majority in this country.”                       24 Jun 2024-11:45AM GMT                                         Farage: I was right to call small boats crisis an ‘invasion’                    Nigel Farage said he was right to describe the small boats Channel migrants crisis as an “invasion”.

He accused the Tories of having “relentlessly driven down the ability” of the UK’s armed forces and there needed to be “30,000 at least” new full soldiers.  “Let’s not stop conning ourselves that somehow increasing expenditure to 2.5 per cent by 2030, the Conservatives’ pledge and Labour sort of matching it, let’s not con ourselves that that is sufficient. It isn’t.  “If there is one area where we need increased spending up to three per cent of GDP, it is defence and we need to do it as quickly as possible and this matters because without the Americans Nato is nothing and the Americans increasingly think that we are not a serious player.”                       24 Jun 2024-11:27AM GMT                                         Boris Johnson the ‘worst PM of modern times’, claims Farage                    Nigel Farage claimed Boris Johnson will go down in history as the “worst prime minister of modern times”.  Mr Johnson took aim at Mr Farage last night on Twitter over his Ukraine comments (see the post below at 09.37). Mr Farage hit back at the former premier as he told a crowd in Maidstone this morning that Mr Johnson had “pretended to be a Conservative but he governed as a Green” .  Mr Farage also unveiled a giant version of an “i” newspaper frontpage from 2016 with the headline “Boris blames EU for war in Ukraine” as the Reform leader defended the comments he made last week  about Ukraine.                       24 Jun 2024-11:23AM GMT                                         Farage: ‘I would never, ever defend Putin’                    Nigel Farage said he would “never, ever defend” Vladimir Putin as he addressed the comments he made last week about Ukraine.  Speaking in Maidstone, the Reform UK leader said: “I would never, ever defend Putin and think his behaviour in Ukraine and elsewhere has been reprehensible.  “But if we are going to think towards a peace at sometime in the not too distant future perhaps it might be helpful to understand what went wrong in the first place.”                       24 Jun 2024-11:20AM GMT                                         Farage jokes he won’t forget grandchild’s birthday on Brexit Day                    Nigel Farage said that this whole general election campaign he had focused on talking about the “things that matter in life: family, community and country”. He said that yesterday he had celebrated the arrival of his first grandchild and he was unlikely to forget his birthday given that it fell on June 23 on the eighth anniversary of the Brexit vote.                      24 Jun 2024-11:15AM GMT                                         Farage arrives in Maidstone for campaign speech                    Nigel Farage has now arrived in Maidstone to deliver a campaign speech from on top of a double decker open top bus.

The Primed Minister said: “The Gambling Commission is independent of Government – it’s independent of me. “I don’t have the details of their investigation, right? They don’t report to me, I don’t have the details, but what I can tell you is, in parallel we’ve been conducting our own internal inquiries and of course will act on any relevant findings or information from that and pass it on to the Gambling Commission.” When asked whether he had ever bet on politics whilst being an MP, the Prime Minister replied: “No.”                      24 Jun 2024-11:03AM GMT                                         Sunak not aware of any other Tory candidates facing gambling probe                    Rishi Sunak said he was not aware of any other Conservative candidates being investigated by the Gambling Commission and ruled out that he was facing the probe. “[The Gambling Commission] don’t talk about the individuals that they are investigating,” the Prime Minister told journalists in a huddle in Edinburgh. “What I can tell you is I am not aware of any other candidate that they are looking at.”                      24 Jun 2024-11:00AM GMT                                         Farage to deliver speech from open top double decker bus                    Nigel Farage will be addressing a crowd in Kent from an open top double decker bus.

The Labour leader told broadcasters: “That’s nonsense. The Gambling Commission is obviously looking at these cases and what we need is leadership from the Prime Minister – he should have suspended those candidates.” He added: “He hasn’t done it because he’s not showing leadership.”                      24 Jun 2024-10:37AM GMT                                         Starmer: ‘I’m not in favour of ideology being taught in our schools on gender’                    Sir Keir Starmer has said he is opposed to “gender ideology” being taught in schools.  Asked if he would rip up the ban on teaching children and young people about “gender ideology” at school, he said: “No, I’m not in favour of ideology being taught in our schools on gender.” Asked about potential changes to sex education in schools, he said: “I think we need to complete the consultation process and make sure that there is guidance that is age appropriate. That is helpful for teachers and has at its heart the safeguarding of children.” Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, had suggested at the weekend  that Labour would ditch guidelines banning children from being taught that there are more than two genders.                       24 Jun 2024-10:32AM GMT                                         Starmer insists economic growth can help pay for Labour’s plans                    Sir Keir Starmer has hit back at claims that he may be unable to deliver on his tax and spending commitments as he insisted his plan to boost economic growth would help to pay for his blueprint for Britain.  The Labour leader told broadcasters: “Economic stability is the foundation on which we grow the economy and create wealth in this country.” He added: “I don’t accept the proposition that the economy cannot be better than it is now, and a lot of the forecasts are on the basis that we can’t improve – I don’t accept that… and that’s why the change at this election is the change between carrying on with what we’ve got, which has got us into this problem, or turning the page and rebuilding the country with Labour, and change only comes if you vote for it, and that’s why it’s a very important election about change and that choice.” Asked whether Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, was “wrong” in his think tank’s analyses over recent weeks, Sir Keir said: “Look, I don’t accept the forecasts that say we can’t do better than this. The economy has flatlined for 14 years. That is exactly what we are wanting to change, that’s why we’ve set out our plans for growth in our manifesto.”                      24 Jun 2024-10:25AM GMT                                         Sir Ed Davey washes an ambulance during campaign visit in Wimbledon                    Sir Ed Davey donned overalls and a hi-vis jacket to clean an ambulance during a campaign visit in target seat Wimbledon in south-west London this morning. On his visit to Wimbledon ambulance station, he chatted to staff and stroked post-traumatic stress disorder assistance dog Teddy. The dog was wearing a harness stating “do not pet”. The Lib Dem leader then used a jet wash to hose down an ambulance, catching watching photographers as the spray bounced off the vehicle. He was making the visit to highlight his warning that there are now just “10 days left to save the NHS”.                      24 Jun 2024-10:23AM GMT                                         Coming up: Nigel Farage to deliver speech in Kent                    We are expecting to hear from Nigel Farage shortly.

He said that if the SNP win a majority of seat in Scotland it will usher in “another five years of ignoring your priorities”.  The Prime Minister said: “A vote for the Scottish Conservatives is a vote to put this issue to bed. To move past these tired and stale arguments and to go forward united and together.”  He added: “But that can only happen if the SNP are routed. If they do not just lose some seats but the SNP lose big. And voting Scottish Conservative is the only way to ensure that that happens.”                       24 Jun 2024-10:09AM GMT                                         Only Tories have ‘courage’ to stand up to SNP, claims Sunak                    Rishi Sunak is now on stage in Edinburgh as he launches the Scottish Tories’ manifesto.  The Prime Minister said it had only been Douglas Ross and the Scottish Tories who had been able to “properly stand up to the SNP” at Holyrood.  He said it was only the Tories who “have the courage to stand up to the nationalists”.                       24 Jun 2024-10:06AM GMT                                         Scottish Tories pledge to scrap intermediate rate of income tax                    The Scottish Tories have pledged to abolish the intermediate rate of income tax north of the border.  Douglas Ross told activists in Edinburgh this morning: “The final of our top-five priorities is reducing family bills across Scotland by cutting their tax. “UK Government action this year alongside the National Insurance tax cuts planned in this manifesto will reduce the tax bill of Scottish workers by up to £2,262 per year. “And today I can announce that we would do our part in Scotland by abolishing the intermediate rate of income tax as an immediate priority. “This would not just close the tax gap between Scotland and the rest of the UK but also reduce the tax bill for workers by up to £171 per year.”                      24 Jun 2024-10:04AM GMT                                         Inflict ‘terrible result’ on SNP to end Indyref2 push ‘for a generation’, says Douglas Ross                    Voters can silence the Scottish independence campaign “for a generation” if they hand the SNP a “terrible result” on July 4, Douglas Ross said.  The SNP has said that if it wins a majority of seats at the general election it will seek to reopen negotiations with the UK Government on holding a second independence referendum.  But Mr Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said defeating the SNP next week would end the party’s “political obsession” for the foreseeable future.  He told activists as he launched the Scottish Conservatives’ manifesto at an event in Edinburgh: “If the SNP do not just lose this election in Scotland but have a terrible result and are defeated right across the country – then we will have put the nationalists’ political obsession to rest for a generation. “Scotland will have again firmly said no to independence. No to more division. No to five more years of separatist campaigning and distraction. That will be a verdict that John Swinney and his SNP Government cannot ignore.”                      24 Jun 2024-09:58AM GMT                                         SNP are ‘on the backfoot’, claims Douglas Ross                    Douglas Ross claimed the SNP are “on the backfoot” as he launched the Scottish Tories’ general election manifesto at an event in Edinburgh.  The leader of the Scottish Conservatives criticised the SNP for seeking to treat the election as a “proxy independence referendum”.  He said: “The SNP have put their political obsession with separating our country on the line. “John Swinney has produced a manifesto that has on the entirety of its first page “Vote SNP for Scotland to be an independent country”. The nationalists are not even trying to hide it. “They are running a single-issue campaign. And treating the general election as a proxy independence referendum. The SNP are on the backfoot – and they know it. They have nothing positive to offer in this election.”                      24 Jun 2024-09:55AM GMT                                         Watch live: Sunak launches Scottish Tories’ manifesto in Edinburgh                                         24 Jun 2024-09:44AM GMT                                         Coming up: Rishi Sunak to launch Scottish Tories’ manifesto                    Rishi Sunak is due to help unveil the Scottish Tories’ general election manifesto at 11am.

Paul Johnson, the director of the think tank, said this morning: “It will be a considerable surprise if no other taxes are increased over the next five years.” The Telegraph’s business live blog is posting updates on the IFS event which is analysing each of the parties’ manifestos this morning.

Asked the question during a visit to a school in Kettering, the Labour leader said “I do think it is good thing to do... it is really interesting”.  He said journalism is “really important in politics and democracy” because it ensures politicians are held to account.                      24 Jun 2024-09:10AM GMT                                         Starmer predicts Arsenal will win Premier League next season                    One pupil asked Sir Keir Starmer, famously an Arsenal fan, who he believes will win the Premier League next season. The Labour leader replied: “It is going to be Arsenal... it is my team and we did really well this year.”  Asked who he believed was Arsenal’s greatest ever midfielder, Sir Keir said Dennis Bergkamp. He picked Thierry Henry as the club’s best ever forward.                      24 Jun 2024-09:07AM GMT                                         Starmer: Voters can ‘turn the page’ on July 4                    Sir Keir Starmer told pupils during a visit to a school in Kettering that there was a clear choice for voters on July 4.  The Labour said people needed to decide “do we want to carry on with what we have got” after 14 years of the Tories being in power or does the nation want to “turn the page” with Labour.                       24 Jun 2024-09:05AM GMT                                         Starmer sets out Labour’s plan to lower voting age during Q&A with school pupils                    Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, and Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, are answering questions from pupils during a visit to a school in the East Midlands this morning.  The first question was about Labour’s plan to lower the voting age to 16.

The previous record for arrivals in the six months from January to June was 12,747 in 2022. There were 11,433 arrivals in the first six months of 2023.

The shadow health secretary told Times Radio: “I think at times in pursuit of inclusion we’ve ended up in a position where women have felt excluded, biological women have felt excluded. “And there are practical examples of this in terms of things like NHS language and documentation.” Asked about Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer’s position on the issue, Mr Streeting said: “I think what Keir has been trying to do on this – I think we all have – is to try and respect the fact that there are people whose gender identity is different from their biological sex and to try and be as inclusive as possible.”                      24 Jun 2024-08:37AM GMT                                         Boris Johnson criticises Nigel Farage over Ukraine comments                    Boris Johnson has accused Nigel Farage of spreading “Kremlin propaganda” over his comments about the war in Ukraine.  Mr Farage sparked a backlash last week after he argued the “ever-eastward expansion of Nato and the EU” had given Vladimir Putin a reason  to justify his invasion. Mr Johnson said on Twitter: “This is nauseating ahistorical drivel and more Kremlin propaganda. Nobody provoked Putin. Nobody ‘poked the bear with a stick’.” Mr Farage hit back this morning, calling the former prime minister a “liar and a hypocrite”.

Asked how he feels about comments by the author criticising the party for “abandoning” women concerned about gender ideology, Mr Streeting told Times Radio: “Pretty depressed, to be honest. “I have a lot of respect for JK Rowling both in terms of what she’s done for children and literacy but also the work that she’s done campaigning for women and in particular violence against women and girls. “I think that we’ve clearly got more work to do to rebuild trust with people that we’ve lost on this issue.” The shadow health secretary added: “I think we can find a way through that both treats trans people with the dignity and respect that they deserve, and also treats women with the respect that they deserve, particularly protecting women’s spaces, women’s voices, and right to speak up.                      24 Jun 2024-08:26AM GMT                                         Coming up: IFS to deliver verdict on election manifestos                    The Institute for Fiscal Studies will deliver its verdict on each of the parties’ general election manifestos at an event later this morning.

Reform has pledged big tax cuts and a significant reduction in public spending while the Green party has promised tax rises and a big increase in public spending.  Mr Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, told the BBC: “I think the further away from power you get, the more apparently radical the manifestos become.  “If you go as far as the Greens and Reform you get into a world where the manifestos look radical but entirely unattainable.”                       24 Jun 2024-07:56AM GMT                                         IFS: Labour and Tory manifestos are not fully-costed                    The Labour and Tory manifestos are not fully-costed despite both parties insisting that they are, the head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said this morning.  Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS think tank, said neither party was being transparent about their public spending plans.  Asked if the manifestos of the main two parties were fully-costed, Mr Johnson said: “No. I think it is fair to say they are not. If you look at the costings numbers at the end of the Labour and Conservative manifestos they have got really very small numbers in them.  “They don’t give us any sense of what the counterfactual is and what I mean by that, if you look at what they will spend on the NHS, the Conservatives are talking around about an extra £1 billion, Labour an extra couple of billion.  “This is off a baseline of nearly £200 billion that we spend on the NHS each year and we will be spending somewhere between £30 and £50 billion more by the end of the Parliament.  “So talking about one or two billion really tells us literally nothing about what they are planning there.”                       24 Jun 2024-07:51AM GMT                                         Cabinet minister defends Sunak over failure to suspend betting scandal Tories                    Chris Heaton-Harris accused a broadcaster of “trying to suggest someone is guilty until proven innocent” when asked why Rishi Sunak would not take robust action over the betting allegations that have engulfed the Conservative Party. Asked whether the Prime Minister should ask Craig Williams when he placed his bet, the Northern Ireland Secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest if that conversation has been had but you asked me if I knew, and I don’t.” On whether the fact that the Tory candidate has not been suspended indicates that Mr Sunak is confident the bet was properly placed, Mr Heaton-Harris said he would not provide any extra comment on an ongoing investigation. Asked whether he could see how the scandal looks to people, the minister said: “I can see how people do not want people to benefit in betting terms or in other terms from having knowledge of a situation, which is why the investigation needs to be taking place.” Asked why the Prime Minister cannot take what former minister Tobias Ellwood has called “robust action”, he told presenter Mishal Husain: “I think what you’re trying to suggest is that someone is guilty until they’re proven innocent and that is not how this works.”                      24 Jun 2024-07:45AM GMT                                         Ellwood: Sunak should have suspended Tory candidates caught up in betting scandal                    A Tory former minister said Rishi Sunak should have suspended Conservative candidates caught up in the general election betting scandal. Tobias Ellwood, who is standing for re-election in Bournemouth East, suggested the Prime Minister should have taken action but conceded it may not have been straight forward to do so. Asked if the PM should have suspended the two candidates, Craig Williams and Laura Saunders who are being looked into by the Gambling Commission as part of a wider investigation, Mr Ellwood told the BBC: “Given the scale of this as we see now and the potential for this story to continue to eclipse, to overshadow the election, I would now agree. “I am not sure anyone, including the Prime Minister, could have predicted the number of people involved when this story first broke. The public want to see clear, robust action now. “The practical dilemma you face though is were individuals responding to the whirlwind of the rumour mill around Westminster at the time… about a pending election announcement or were they in the room when the decision was made. “If it was the latter the party can take immediate action. Otherwise it is for the Gambling Commission to rightly make that judgement.”                      24 Jun 2024-07:40AM GMT                                         Ex-minister: Ban politicians and party officials from being able to place political bets                    New gambling rules should be introduced to ban all politicians and party officials from being able to place bets on political events, a Tory former minister has suggested.  Tobias Ellwood told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “Let’s give the nation greater reassurance that I think it wants to see to ensure this never happens again.  “Let’s introduce clear rules as you have in the banking world and in the city… let’s prevent any current politician or party professional from placing any bets in the future.  “That would send a clear message to the public that this sad incident is being taken seriously and it won’t happen again.”                       24 Jun 2024-07:33AM GMT                                         Nigel Farage celebrates arrival of first grandchild                    Starting the week on a high. My first grandchild was born yesterday evening.

The shadow health secretary said a Labour government would “deliver 700,000 urgent dentistry appointments to help stabilise the system”. Mr Streeting told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “People are literally pulling their own teeth out or ending up in A&E departments in pretty bad shape.” He added that Labour would “get the British Dental Association in to start the process of long overdue contract reform”. “Because I think what will shock people, especially those who’ve either paid through the nose for private dentistry, or have been priced out altogether, is that last year there was a £400 million underspend in the NHS dentistry budget”.                      24 Jun 2024-07:03AM GMT                                         Introducing insurance model for dentistry would be ‘slippery slope’, says Streeting                    Wes Streeting said introducing an insurance model for dentistry would be a “dangerous, slippery slope”. Labour is today unveiling a “dentistry rescue plan” which includes the promise of an extra 700,000 urgent and emergency dental appointments a year and “golden” hellos” of £20,000 for new dentistry graduates who spend at least three years working in under-served areas. The shadow health secretary was asked why Labour had not considered introducing an insurance model to improve the funding for dentistry.  He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “I think that is a dangerous, slippery slope. I don’t think the problem with the NHS, fundamentally, is the model of funding which is equitable and built on the principle of fairness and fair access.  “I think it is about where the money goes.”                      24 Jun 2024-06:49AM GMT                                         Northern Ireland Secretary ‘not really’ a betting man                    Chris Heaton-Harris said he was “not really” a betting man. Asked what he thought of people who were, the Northern Ireland Secretary told Sky News this morning: “I don’t mind people who have a bet on things they have no knowledge about, which is what most gamblers do.” Mr Heaton-Harris said that on the campaign trail, people are “worried about what a Labour incoming government might do.” “That is what people are talking about,” he said.                      24 Jun 2024-06:40AM GMT                                         Chris Heaton-Harris: Labour’s private school tax raid ‘unwise’                    Chris Heaton-Harris said Labour’s plan to impose VAT on private school fees was “unwise” because it could prompt a pupil exodus, putting huge pressure on the state education sector.  Asked if he believed the policy was “unfair”, the Northern Ireland Secretary told Sky News: “I think that is unwise certainly. I think people who have saved hard, worked hard, want to spend extra money on their children;’s education should be allowed to. “I actually think it is a very bad policy because it also means lots of children would be entering… a state education system which is doing really well but is not ready to cater for thousands of extra pupils coming in at this time.”                      24 Jun 2024-06:30AM GMT                                         North Sea oil and gas industry not safe with Labour, Sunak to claim                    Rishi Sunak  will today accuse Labour of “virtue signalling to eco zealots” instead of protecting North Sea oil and gas jobs.  The Prime Minister will visit Edinburgh to launch the Scottish Tory manifesto and will claim that Sir Keir Starmer would tax the vital UK energy sector “into oblivion” while attacking Labour’s “ideological” plans to ban new licences. In contrast, he is to pledge that a Tory government would introduce new legislation to guarantee that there would be further annual oil and gas licensing rounds and promise to maintain tax breaks for investment by energy companies.

Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland Secretary, claimed Labour was trying to “lean on” the organisation. Pat McFadden, Labour’s election campaign coordinator, wrote to the Gambling Commission at the weekend to urge it to release the names of figures being investigated. Mr Heaton-Harris said this was “pretty concerning”. He told Times Radio: “It has said it is investigating offences in relation to the date of the election, that it is an ongoing investigation and that it won’t provide any details at this time and it is not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals concerned. And it is right that it has an investigation. It is an independent body. “I actually think, I saw that the leader of Labour’s campaign, Pat McFadden, wrote to try and put some undue influence on the Gambling Commission over the weekend and I think that is actually pretty concerning in itself, Labour trying to lean on yet another independent body like it leant on the Speaker of the House of Commons to not have a vote on Gaza. “I think you are beginning to see, people are beginning to see, what a Labour government would actually be like in the United Kingdom.”                       24 Jun 2024-06:08AM GMT                                         Labour would create ‘more loopholes for predators’ with gender plans, claims Badenoch                    Kemi Badenoch claimed Labour’s gender plans would create “more loopholes for predators”.  A Labour government would reportedly make it easier for people to legally change their gender.  The Times reported that the party would remove the requirement for people to have to prove they have lived as another gender for a two year period before they can obtain a gender recognition certificate.  Ms Badenoch, the minister for Women and Equalities, said: “These proposals unravel all the protections in the current system designed to protect women and girls. This change creates more loopholes for predators and bad faith actors to infiltrate women-only spaces and put us at risk.  “Labour have never understood or cared about this issue or the vulnerable women impacted by their policies.”                      24 Jun 2024-05:57AM GMT                                         Coming up: Wes Streeting on the broadcast round for Labour                    Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, is on the morning broadcast round for Labour.  Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland Secretary, will be answering questions on behalf of the Conservative Party.                      24 Jun 2024-05:51AM GMT                                         Starmer vows to ‘champion our armed forces’                    Armed Forces Week is an opportunity to thank our Armed Forces for all they do to keep Britain safe.My Labour government will champion our armed forces and support our veterans. We will establish a new Armed Forces Commissioner and put the Armed Forces Covenant fully into law.                      24 Jun 2024-05:40AM GMT                                         What is happening in the general election campaign today?                    Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will take part in a live question-and-answer session this evening as the general election campaign enters its final full week. The Prime Minister and the Labour leader are set to face questions from Harry Cole, the political editor of The Sun, and a panel of the newspaper’s readers from 5pm. It will come after Mr Sunak visits Edinburgh to launch the Scottish Conservative manifesto along with Douglas Ross, the party’s leader in Scotland. He is not the only senior politician heading north of the border on Monday as Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, visits a clean energy project with Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, where they will discuss Labour’s green energy policies. Nigel Farage, the Reform leader, continues his campaign with a lunchtime event in Kent and an evening rally in Devon. And the Institute for Fiscal Studies will present its analysis of the parties’ general election manifestos from 10am, with Paul Johnson, the director of the influential think tank, leading comparisons between the Labour and Tory offerings.                      24 Jun 2024-05:37AM GMT                                         Calling election on July 4 ‘could well backfire’, says Kwarteng                    Rishi Sunak’s decision to trigger the general election on July 4 “could well backfire”, according to Kwasi Kwarteng.  Asked if opting for an earlier than expected contest was a mistake, the Tory former chancellor told GB News: “I could see why he did it but, as it’s turned out, it looks like it could well backfire.”                      24 Jun 2024-05:33AM GMT                                         Kwarteng: Sunak ‘very much responsible’ if Tories suffer ‘massive defeat’                    Kwasi Kwarteng said Rishi Sunak will be “very much responsible” if the Tories suffer a “massive defeat” on July 4.  The Tory former chancellor said that no one person would receive all of the blame but he pointed out that the timing of the contest was entirely a decision made by the Prime Minister.  His comments were in response to Michael Gove, the Levelling Up Secretary, suggesting that Liz Truss would be to blame if the Conservatives lose the general election.  “If there is a defeat, blame will be apportioned to lots of different people,” Mr Kwarteng told GB News.  “But this idea that Rishi Sunak could call the election when he did, when no one was expecting it, least of all the party it would appear, who has been front and centre of the campaign, under whom Reform has risen to nearly 20 per cent, the idea that he had nothing to do with any of that is wrong. “When I left office, I was just checking, actually, the polls just now, Reform were on about 4 per cent. I think when Liz Truss left in October 2022, they were 4, 5 per cent.” He added: “If you suffer a massive defeat, clearly the leader is very much responsible for that. What proportion? I don’t know. Obviously there were other mistakes done by other leaders. He called the time of the election.” Load-Date: June 24, 2024  End of Document
