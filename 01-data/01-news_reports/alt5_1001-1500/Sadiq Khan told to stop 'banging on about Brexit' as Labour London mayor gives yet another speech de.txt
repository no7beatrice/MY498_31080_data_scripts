   Sadiq Khan told to stop 'banging on about Brexit' as Labour London mayor gives yet another speech demanding the UK has a 'closer relationship with the EU' and embraces MORE immigration MailOnline January 11, 2024 Thursday 8:55 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:5 Length: 713 words Byline: David Wilcock, Deputy Political Editor Greg Heffer, Political Correspondent For Mailonline Body                        Sadiq Khan was told to stop 'banging on about Brexit' today as the London mayor prepares to give another speech about the EU. The London mayor will use an exclusive City event to warn that the decision to leave the EU eight years ago is 'a key contributor to the cost-of-living crisis' affecting Britons. He has commissioned a report suggesting Brexit has cost the UK economy £140billion, leaving the average UK adult nearly £2,000 worse off in 2023, and the average Londoner nearly £3,400 worse off.  In his annual Mansion House speech he is expected to say the 'hardline version of Brexit we've ended up with is dragging our economy down and pushing up the cost of living'. The speech is also remarkably similar to the one he gave at the same event last year, where he called for a 'pragmatic debate' on rejoining the Single Market and Customs Union.  Susan Hall, Mr Khan's Tory opponent in May's mayoral election, said: 'Sadiq Khan always ends up banging on about Brexit when he gets into trouble. A thousand people have been murdered on London's streets while he has been failing to lead the police, and his unfair ULEZ expansion is ripping off families, small businesses and charities.' And the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'The UK has grown faster than Italy and Germany since the 2016 referendum and its grown faster than Germany since leaving the EU in 2020. 'The IMF forecast for medium-term growth is brighter than many of our European neighbours - that includes France and Germany. 'And, obviously, Brexit provides us with freedoms that are enabling the public to access medicines faster, allowing farmers to get more support from the Government and for us to seek free trade agreements.' In his speech Mr Khan will launch a broadside against Brexit, saying: 'It's making food more expensive, adding to the acute pressures on households and having an ongoing detrimental impact on industries that are crucial to our success - such as hospitality, construction and financial services.' And in words which might cause the most ructions in Labour HQ he will argue that great immigration is 'part of the solution'.  'I'm certainly not in favour of open borders or uncontrolled immigration. But with severe worker shortages, we must be honest about what's best for our city,' he will say. 'We need both British and foreign-born workers to support our public services, power our companies and drive our capital and country forward. 'Immigration is a difficult, contentious issue. But the economic benefits - not to mention the social and cultural advantages - mean we have a duty to craft an approach that's guided by facts, not fearmongering.' But his comments are likely to raise the ire of Sir Keir in an election year. The opposition leader has tried to keep a lid on Brexit as an election issue, having campaigned for Remain and a second referendum on EU membership. He has ruled out rejoining the Customs Union and Single Market, changes Mr Khan has previous backed.  They also provoked a backlash from his opponents in May's mayoral election.  Howard Cox, the Reform candidate, said: 'The London Mayor should butt out of national and international politics and focus on cutting knife crime, housing young people in affordable homes and to stop fleecing drivers. With his purely cash grabbing ULEZ scheme, he has reduced the capital's GDP by nearly £1billion per year. So his comments about leaving the EU are not only hypocritical but ill-informed.' The independent report by Cambridge Econometrics, commissioned by City Hall, shows London has 290,000 fewer jobs than if Brexit had not taken place. Half of the two million job losses nationwide linked to it are in the financial services and construction sectors. It argues that UK real Gross Value Added (GVA)- a measure of the size of the economy- is approximately £140bn less in 2023 than it would have been had the UK opted to remain in the Customs Union and Single Market. London's GVA is down £30billion, it argues. Shyamoli Patel, principal economist at Cambridge Econometrics, said: 'Our study reveals that London's economy would have grown faster if Brexit hadn't taken place. Looking ahead, we project that Brexit will continue to have an impact on the UK and London economies in the medium term.'  Load-Date: January 11, 2024  End of Document
