   Letters: Hope that JK Rowling’s fightback can spell the end of Scottish wokery telegraph.co.uk April 3, 2024 Wednesday 12:02 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: OPINION; Version:1 Length: 1731 words Byline: By Letters to the Editor Highlight: Plus: Post-Brexit freedoms; solar farm folly; old county allegiances; councils’ persecution of second-home owners; and mod rule Body   SIR – If, as Byron put it, Cervantes “smiled Spain’s chivalry away”, hopefully some bard of the future will record that “J K Rowling  smiled Scotland’s wokery away”.John WebsterOxford SIR – Rishi Sunak was right to back J K Rowling  over her remarks on Scotland’s new hate-crime law. He should go further and give her a damehood for services to national sanity in the next honours list.Jennifer ReynoldsOkehampton, Devon SIR – I see that under the new Scottish hate-crime law, an offence can be committed on the say-so of “a reasonable person” (“Thousands of police ‘not trained’ on hate law”, report , April 2). This might invite the question, for instance, of whether transgender activists are “reasonable people” or hysterical extremists. Who is to judge?Roger WhiteSherborne, Dorset SIR – It has been shocking to learn of the amount of hatred pervading Scotland and its people, and that this may now take a whole industry to deal with – including 500 hate-crime champions  (report, March 27). It seems they must have been fooling us all this time into thinking they were normal, decent people.Hilary ChelminskiAddiscombe, Surrey SIR – Humza Yousaf, Scotland’s First Minister, said: “There is far too much hatred in our society” (Features, April 1). Has he looked in the SNP mirror? His predecessor, Nicola Sturgeon, said in October 2022: “I detest the Tories and everything they stand for.”Peter RichardsonAmersham, Buckinghamshire SIR – Isn’t it ironic that a party whose sole raison d’etre is to break up the United Kingdom has introduced the Hate Crime (Scotland) Act? The SNP has systematically played on irrational animosity towards the English in order to further its delusional objective of achieving independence. This legislation is not only misguided, it’s the height of hypocrisy.Ian GarrattBrasted, Kent SIR – One has to ask whether the term “United Kingdom” has become a misnomer. Devolution, intended to enable local areas to deal with local issues, is one thing – and probably acceptable to most of the electorate. However, we now have different law on freedom of speech within and beyond one’s household in separate parts of the Kingdom. Is devolution out of control? Peter WillimanChatteris, Cambridgeshire                      Brexit freedoms                    SIR – Sherelle Jacobs says  that pledges to scrap EU laws have been watered down (“Britain is now irrationally terrified of freedom. It should just rejoin the EU”, Comment, April 2). However, we have scrapped or reformed over 2,000 EU laws and another 1,000 are on the way out. Meanwhile, the EU has created nearly 8,000 new regulations in that time. Yes, I have paused our free-trade agreement negotiations with Canada, but that is a Brexit freedom. As Trade Secretary, I can do that if I do not believe a deal benefits the UK. If we were in the EU, the UK alone would never have been able to pause a trade agreement.In any case, we have just ratified our accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a trade bloc that includes Canada, and will be home to half of the world’s 2.3 billion middle-class consumers by 2030. Members of the CPTPP, more so than the EU, will set the terms of international trade in the future. Britain is in there early to ensure we steer those terms. Another Brexit freedom. People think Brexit isn’t working – and of course there is more to do – but I would encourage Ms Jacobs to read “Brexit: Fourth Anniversary”, which my department published this year. It compiles a list of statistics and successes comparing the UK with peer countries, and shows that Global Britain is thriving on the world stage.Kemi Badenoch MP (Con)Business and Trade SecretaryLondon SW1 SIR – Having read Sherelle Jacobs’s article on our failure to take advantage of Brexit freedoms, I’d like to know what Reform UK has to say. As a Conservative Party member who has voted for it for almost 60 years, I am seriously thinking of changing my allegiance. We voted Brexit because we wanted to deregulate and get away from the EU’s red tape.Janet MillikenCapel-le-Ferne, Kent                      Pothole priority                    SIR – Perhaps National Highways, working with Wiltshire Council, could look at the state of the roads in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, before committing all their money to the Stonehenge tunnel.One main road, Abbey Row, is lethal. There are potholes inches deep that fill with water and drench pedestrians. Loose gravel is everywhere – a disaster waiting to happen for bikers, pedestrians and motorists.Ann TaylorMalmesbury, Wiltshire                      Travels with my mixer                    SIR – In 1963 my husband was in Aden on a visit with his squadron and he bought me a Kenwood Chef (Letters, April 2 ) – a luxury item then. It has survived the vicissitudes of 21 military moves, and it and we are still around. Eileen BurridgeRingwood, Hampshire SIR – When we married in 1971 we were given a set of unattractive yellow Tupperware storage boxes. One is still going strong, still in use and still unattractive.Vanessa DavisLondon SW19 SIR – Some years ago we were looking around a museum of domestic appliances in York with our small children when one suddenly said: “There’s our microwave.”We beat a hasty retreat.John MarshSheringham, Norfolk                      Solar farm folly                    SIR – While the Duke of Beaufort’s plans for a 2,000-acre solar farm to be built partly on his estate may be damaging to the environment, surely the most striking part of your report  (April 2) is that landowners not only receive a substantial subsidy for using their land in this way, but also get a return five times greater than if they use it to produce food.Is it cynical to suggest that, if too many others follow suit, the UK’s population will have starved long before we reach the magical net zero?Robin LaneDevizes, Wiltshire SIR – You report  (April 2) a Government source as saying: “We are the first major economy to halve our emissions.”A more honest comment would continue with: “However, despite the billions of pounds spent, this has had zero effect on the global climate.”N H BaileyStockport, Lancashire                       County identity                    SIR – Your article  marking the 50th anniversary of the redrawing of local authority boundaries does not sufficiently emphasise the anguish caused to many in 1974, who felt that their centuries-old county identity had been removed from them without their consent (“Heseltine: Historic counties overhaul was not far enough”, report, April 1).I was deeply pained by my home town of Tynemouth being apparently excised from Northumberland and attached to Tyne and Wear. But you can’t abolish a place. Northumberland still extends to the Tyne.Had greater respect been paid to local feelings and historical tradition, existing county allegiances could have been kept alive, and confusion avoided by not using the term county in the names of local authorities. Happily, more and more people are now aware of their traditional county.Graham ShipleyThurnby, Leicestershire                      Back to Bach                    SIR – If Ian France (Letters, April 2 ) finds Bach’s St John Passion tuneless, he might prefer his St Matthew Passion, where one aches for the final chorus to continue forever.I agree with him on Donizetti’s Lucia, a tragedy, but for sheer musicality throughout it is difficult to beat Mozart’s comedy, Così fan tutte.John BirkettSt Andrews, Fife                      Mod rule: a movement that shaped the world                    SIR – Mods have been influential worldwide in music, fashion and ethics (“Mods and rockers: the rivalry that whipped up a media frenzy”, Arts , April 1). The mod movement is a way of life, of dancing and of looking smart, with Levi’s and Clarks desert boots. It embraced so much: Vespas and Lambrettas, Motown, Stax Records, Small Faces and The Who. I disagree with Max Décharné that “you’ve now got to be 74 to be a mod” since “young people ... have other things to do”. One can learn from the past and adapt. Does he forget the mod revival in the 1980s? Once a mod, always a mod.Nobby ClarkNorth Walsham, Norfolk                      Councils’ persecution of second-home owners                    SIR – Councils doubling council tax  for second-home owners (report, April 1) is another example of a worrying move towards social engineering, which should not be within their remit. Council tax is supposed to pay for services received, not influence behaviour. That is why it varies between local authorities. Yes, it is fair that home owners should pay a council tax that reflects how many people could occupy their home and enjoy council services, but those who may only have two modest homes should not have to pay three times the amount that someone else pays for a single house. There was a time when second-home owners actually got a discount to reflect the fact they were using services less. That made far more sense.Richard Hopkinson-WoolleyLondon SW19 SIR – We own a first-floor flat, which we tried to sell when my wife started to develop mobility problems. However, the pandemic interfered and two potential sales fell through.In early 2022 my wife had to go into hospital, but when, six weeks later, she was ready to come home, the NHS transport people found they could not get her back up the stairs and into the flat. We were therefore forced to move into rented accommodation. At the same time, the flat was put up for sale again, but for two years now it has failed to sell.We have been paying the standard council tax on the property throughout, as well as paying the tax on the rented property in which we actually live.Earlier this year Herefordshire Council wrote to us to say that, because the flat has now been empty for more than 12 months, the council tax would double with effect from April 1. I wrote to the council to explain our circumstances, but was told that none of the exemptions applies.Alan TattersallLedbury, Herefordshire                      Letters to the Editor                    We accept letters by email and post.
