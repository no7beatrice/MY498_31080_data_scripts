   Why Reform UK chose Clacton — and the verdict from locals thetimes.co.uk June 4, 2024 Tuesday 6:10 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 1963 words Byline: Constance Kampfner Highlight: Nigel Farage picked a Brexit-supporting seaside town for his political comeback, but not everyone is pleased to see him Body   Clacton-on-Sea has a few dubious honours to its name.  The Essex coastal town was named Britain’s joint least favourite seaside resort, alongside Skegness, in a nationwide survey last year. It is home to the third highest proportion of economically inactive people in the country, and has some of the worst crime and child poverty rates. Its residents are far more likely to be in poor health and far less likely to have any formal qualifications than the general populace.  And now it could become best known for being the place where  Nigel Farage  finally, on his eighth attempt, got lucky.  The professional agitator and Reform UK leader announced a surprise campaign to become Clacton’s next MP, days after ruling himself out of a return to frontline politics during  the general election .  The former Ukip and Brexit Party leader had said he preferred to focus his energies on helping  Donald Trump  to regain power in the US in November, describing a “strong America” as “vital for our peace and security”. He performed a volte-face, he said, after repeated chivvying from people he encountered on the campaign trail. Farage said the guilt of not standing up for those disillusioned with Westminster politics had simply become too much and, following a weekend of soul searching, he had come to the conclusion that he had no choice but to throw his hat into the electoral ring.  Tony Mack, the party’s candidate until Monday — who has lived locally for several years after nearly two decades as a black cab driver in London — was booted out to make way for the new hopeful. “Sometimes tough things have to be done,” Farage noted.  He was also “invited” to take over as party leader by Richard Tice, who had been struggling with name recognition, and has pledged to stay in post for five years.  On Tuesday, the veteran Eurosceptic took to Clacton pier, where the serpentine rollercoasters provided an apt visual echo of his latest political twists and turns. Elevated on a picnic table beside the ferris wheel, Farage promised to “stand up” for the people of the town by  being “a bloody nuisance” .  Clacton is a constituency that stretches from the more affluent towns of Walton-on-the-Naze and Frinton-on-Sea down the coast of the Tendring peninsula to Jaywick, which has been ranked the most deprived place in the country in official government statistics. It is the only parliamentary constituency that has ever been won at a general election by a party associated with Farage. Clacton became known as the beating heart of the Brexit campaign after its Conservative MP, Douglas Carswell, defected to Ukip in 2014, triggering a by-election which he then won with 60 per cent of the vote. Carswell, the co-founder of Vote Leave, managed to hold on to his seat at the general election the following year, albeit with a smaller share of the vote, before deciding to sit as an independent in 2017. When the referendum came along, 73 per cent of residents voted to leave the EU — the second highest support for Brexit in the country after Boston & Skegness, where Tice is running.  Clacton’s Conservative incumbent, the former actor Giles Watling, won in 2019 with a resounding majority of 24,702. But Farage and his team have calculated that that is a lead they might well be able to overturn. With the Tories facing wipeout —  a cataclysmic YouGov poll  suggested the party was at risk of losing three in five of the seats it won five years ago — most analysts over the past 24 hours have concurred.  Farage is a familiar face in the town, having campaigned there during previous elections and the Brexit referendum. He used his speech on Tuesday to sing the praises of the local Wetherspoons and made a dash there immediately afterwards where he spoke to the press, perched on a stool with his Union Jack socks on show and a compulsory pint in his hand.  Supporters were out in droves to watch him, with cheers of “you’re a hero Nigel” and “welcome back” greeting Reform’s new leader as he made his way through the crowds. Michael Jerron and his wife, Dorothy, had come from Tunbridge Wells, light blue rosettes pinned to their chests, to see Farage speak. “I have a French name, just like him,” Jerron, 82, said.  Tice dutifully introduced his boss, telling The Times afterwards that he was “delighted” Farage had seized the mantle: “I’ve been hoping and urging him to stand for ages.” Addressing residents, Farage paid tribute to the capital of Essex’s Sunshine Coast without which, he said, “Brexit would not have happened”.  Yet despite lauding Clacton as the “most patriotic town” in Britain, his ten-minute speech contained little mention of local issues. “What do I have to offer you?” he asked. “Well I can promise you that I do know one thing: that a woman can’t have a penis.” Raucous laughter ensued.  His pitch was a straightforward one: Labour would inevitably win at the general election, so who did people want around to sort through the wreckage of the right? “This election effectively is over,” Farage declared. “We are going to get a Labour government whether you like it or not. The question is: who is gonna be the voice of opposition? I want  Reform UK  with me at the helm to be in parliament and I promise you, I promise you I’ll liven it up a lot from what it currently is. “You won’t get any woke PC nonsense from me because I’ve always told it as it is and stood up for what I believe in.” Speaking afterwards to reporters, Farage said he was “looking ahead to 2029” and to creating what would essentially be a new party, which he suggested a “chunk” of the Tories could join. He compared the situation to Canadian politics, where Stephen Harper was elected as a Reform Party MP in 1993 but went on to head a “new Conservative” government.  Away from the fanfare, there were mixed reviews for Farage in the rest of the town. While some said they were pleased he had chosen to “put it on the map”, others said they were “legging it” away from the pier as fast as they could before his arrival.  Gordon Laggan, 64, told The Times he had “always liked” Farage, who seemed to be “an honest bloke”.  “He gets the people going,” he said. “I was all for coming out of Europe because I just think it’s time to look after ourselves. We’re getting tons of people over, when we’ve got people sleeping rough all over the place.”  Laggan, a Labour supporter in his youth who voted Conservative in the last two elections and Ukip before that, said he had recently retired and moved to Clacton hoping to revisit fond memories of coming to the town every summer as a boy.  “I know Jaywick is shocking now but 50 years ago it was great. People just deserted it,” he said. Though Farage might not be a local, Laggan believes he would be “more keyed in” to issues blighting the area than other politicians. “You can’t say that about this prime minister; him and his wife between them are millionaires. He [Farage] is more working class than a lot of them.” Farage’s decision to run had also made an impression on Nicholas Chapman, a bus driver and lifelong Labour voter who has lived in Clacton for 20 years. He said he was on the fence about Farage.  “I think he’s got a safe seat here, to be honest,” he said.  Chapman, 63, believes immigration has “got out of hand”, but said that Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy had been a waste of money, which could have better been spent on housing. “I feel sorry for the children of this country because they have no future. When I was their age I could afford a mortgage,” he said.  Schools, healthcare and the state of the roads were other key concerns. Yet when asked if Farage would be an effective local champion, Chapman said he had no illusions about his intentions. “He wants to be leader of the Tory party,” he said. “He’s just using us as a stepping stone.” “No thanks,” was Patricia Cupidon’s stance. “I know he’s not a fan of people like me. I was born and bred in the UK but he makes people think that anyone who looks like me are immigrants who don’t contribute to society.” Cupidon, an educator who moved to Clacton from London to be closer to her mother two years ago, said people like Farage cared only about “what they can get out of people” and “what they can lead people to believe”.  Berni Kenna, 63, who has lived in the town for 40 years, said she was “horrified” by Farage’s campaign. “He’s just too right wing,” the care worker said. Neither she nor Cupidon knew who they would be voting for.  Farage first stood for parliament in 1994 at the Eastleigh by-election where he won less than 2 per cent of votes. There were a further five tilts in various seats across southern England before his best attempt in South Thanet in 2015 where he won 32 per cent of support, finishing a close second to the Conservative  Craig Mackinlay . He does best in these left-behind coastal areas. Once a thriving holiday destination for the working classes, Clacton, like so many others, was devastated by the dawn of the budget airline. Bed and breakfasts became bedsits, clothes stores became charity shops and Jaywick’s cheaply built holiday homes, hastily erected on the salt marshes, became people’s permanent residences.  In 2019 the Tories won two thirds of coastal seats. But last year the right-leaning think tank Onward warned that the party needed to do more to help struggling seaside towns or risk a political “tidal wave”. It found that people living within three miles of England’s coast had disposable incomes that were on average £2,800 lower than those living inland, a gap that had been widening since the 2008 financial crisis. Clacton has recently benefited from a £20 million levelling-up grant that has allowed it to begin the process of regenerating its town centre and high street. Visitor numbers last year were back to pre-pandemic levels.  Yet people of all political persuasions still used a slew of expletives to describe the town.  Nobody The Times spoke to under the age of 40 in a snap survey expressed any interest in politics. “Who’s that then?” one young man responded when asked for his views on Farage. Abbie Chapman, 30, a dog groomer, said she only knew him from his appearance on                     I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!                    Amy Watts, 49, an English and maths tutor from the more affluent town of Frinton, accused Farage of “using Clacton as an easy win because people here haven’t been exposed to wider politics”.  She said: “It is a deprived and somewhat uneducated constituency.” Farage told The Times: “Look, this place is very deprived, it has problems at every level. The schools are poor, unemployment is still over 40 per cent here … and while there are two or three very good engineering companies, there aren’t enough of them. “Without making any promises that I can’t keep, what I have said is that if a national figure represents a constituency that is at the end of the railway line — literally marginalised, ignored — maybe, just maybe I can encourage some investment to come here.” But he bristled when a broadcaster asked him to locate the ground of the local football team, or recite Clacton’s postcode. “I’m not going to play silly games,” he said.  A fan of political surprises, Farage encountered one himself as he finally left the pub this afternoon and made his way back towards the Reform bus. A woman, later identified as Victoria Thomas-Bowen, 25, expressed her displeasure by swilling the politician with what appeared to be a banana milkshake from McDonald’s. She was later arrested on suspicion of assault. The Jeremy Corbyn supporter and Only Fans model, who hails from a family of Brexiteers, justified her actions, which were condemned across the political spectrum. “He doesn’t represent us,” she said. Yet if he gets his way, Reform’s leader will soon be doing just that. Load-Date: June 4, 2024  End of Document
