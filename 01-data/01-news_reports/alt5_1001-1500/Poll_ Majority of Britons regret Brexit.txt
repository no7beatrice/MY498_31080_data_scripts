According to the survey of more than 2,000 people, only one in 10 believe that leaving the European Union helped their personal financial situation, compared to 35% who say it was bad for their finances. Meanwhile, 9% of respondents indicate that Brexit had a positive impact on the NHS, compared to 47% who believe it had a negative effect.

"There continues to be public dissatisfaction with the way the Government managed Brexit, with perceived failures even in areas previously seen as a potential benefit of leaving the EU," asserted James Crouch, head of policy and public affairs at Opinium. For Crouch, "Brexit is likely to be   a secondary issue at the next election compared to the state of the economy and the National Health Service, which are the clear priority for voters." One of the main claims of Brexit supporters was that leaving the EU single market and customs union would usher in a new era of global trade for the UK based on trade deals with other parts of the world. Many voters now seem to have come to the conclusion that Brexit has, in fact, been detrimental to trade. Load-Date: January 2, 2024  End of Document
