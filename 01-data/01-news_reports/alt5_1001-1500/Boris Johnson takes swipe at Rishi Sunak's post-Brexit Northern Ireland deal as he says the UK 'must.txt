   Boris Johnson takes swipe at Rishi Sunak's post-Brexit Northern Ireland deal as he says the UK 'must retain the courage to diverge' from the European model MailOnline February 1, 2024 Thursday 12:09 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 411 words Byline: David Churchill Body                        Boris Johnson yesterday took a swipe at Rishi Sunak's new post-Brexit deal on trading rules for Northern Ireland. The former prime minister suggested it could weaken the UK's ability to diverge from EU trading rules in future. Posting on X, formerly Twitter, he said: 'Four years on from Brexit we celebrate the restoration of this country's democratic power to make its own laws and rules. 'With those Brexit freedoms we have introduced improved standards for animal welfare, cut taxes on sanitary products, created greater flexibility for cutting edge industries from financial services to bioscience, done many global free trade deals - and it was at least partly thanks to Brexit that this country had the fastest Covid vaccine rollout in Europe.' But he added: 'We must retain the appetite and the courage to diverge from the low-growth high-regulation European model. 'We must at all costs avoid a return to anything remotely like the disastrous 'Chequers' formula whereby artificial concerns about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland are used to keep the whole of the UK in alignment with EU rules.' He was referring to his predecessor Theresa May's proposed 'Chequers' deal for post-Brexit trading relations, which was rejected because it would have forced Britain to align itself with the EU's trading rulebook. But Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris dismissed the claim. Speaking in the Commons he said: 'This package will not reduce our ability to diverge, nor our ability to do so should it be in the interests of the UK.' DUP MP Sammy Wilson was also critical of the deal, saying in a Commons debate: 'When the Northern Ireland assembly sits, ministers and assembly members will be expected by law to adhere to and implement laws which are made in Brussels, which they had no say over and no ability to amend, and no ability to stop. 'This is a result of this spineless, weak-kneed, Brexit-betraying Government, refusing to take on the EU and its interference in Northern Ireland.' However, most DUP MPs expressed support for the deal. Former home secretary Priti Patel said: 'It is vital that we ensure that [there is] the ability to diverge and have the freedom to secure Northern Ireland's economic lifeblood but also the prosperity of Northern Ireland absolutely remains.' Mr Heaton-Harris gave her assurances, saying: 'This will not reduce our ability to diverge [after future trade deals] nor our commitment to do so. Load-Date: February 1, 2024  End of Document
