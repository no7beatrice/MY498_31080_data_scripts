   Cabinet minister admits betting three times on election date telegraph.co.uk June 25, 2024 Tuesday 10:02 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:6 Length: 11772 words Byline: By Nick Gutteridge, Chief Political Correspondent and Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor and Genevieve Holl-Allen, Political Reporter and Dominic Penna, Political Correspondent Body   Follow The Telegraph’s latest general election live blog A Cabinet minister has admitted betting on the date of the general election, deepening the gambling scandal  in Westminster. On Tuesday night, Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, said he had placed three bets on the date of the general election, one of which was successful. He denied earlier reports that he had won £2,100 on a wager, as he tried to dismiss the remarks, reported by the BBC, as a “joke” and said that the gambling watchdog had not contacted him. Mr Jack said in a statement released just after 10pm: “Following reports today I want to be absolutely clear I have not breached any gambling rules. I placed two unsuccessful bets on the date of the general election and one successful one. “I put two bets on in March of £5 each for an election to be held in May and June respectively. In April, I put £20 at 5 to 1 on an election being held between July and September. I had no knowledge of the date of the election until the day it was called. As I have said previously, I placed no bets in May and am not under investigation by the Gambling Commission.” Mr Sunak will come under pressure to act over Mr Jack’s gambling, regardless of the timing of the bets. In a day of fast-moving developments, the Conservatives suspended two candidates  over allegations that they placed bets on the date of the election, with the Prime Minister criticised for failing to act sooner. Russell George, the Tories’ deputy chief whip in Wales, became the fifth party figure to be publicly named as part of the investigation and Labour was dragged into the growing scandal as it suspended one of its own candidates who put a wager on himself losing his seat.  Meanwhile, Scotland Yard confirmed that the Gambling Commission was looking at five more police officers  over election bets, as The Telegraph revealed on Monday, after one from Mr Sunak’s close protection team was arrested. Mr Jack, who is standing down at the election, was said to have told the BBC that he made £2,100 out of betting on June and July election dates, reportedly saying that one wager was placed at odds of 25/1. The corporation said that when it followed up on the comments, which were made before the betting scandal emerged two weeks ago, he said they were “a joke” and “I was pulling your leg”. In an initial statement the Scottish Secretary said: “I am very clear that I have never, on any occasion, broken any Gambling Commission rules. “Specifically, I did not place any bets on the date of the general election during May, the period under investigation by the Gambling Commission.” However, following pressure to be clear about his betting – including from the SNP, who said Mr Jack had a “duty to come forward with the full details” – Mr Jack admitted he had bet on the election date three times. Mr Jack is not a candidate for the Tories at the election and is no longer an MP in Dumfries and Galloway because Parliament has been dissolved for the election.  However, ministers continue to serve in their posts during an election period, meaning that he could potentially be sacked by Mr Sunak from his Cabinet post.  The SNP said Mr Jack had a “duty to come forward with the full details”, with the party’s Scotland spokesman Tommy Sheppard saying: “As a senior cabinet member in the Tory government, and a well-known confidant of Sunak, Jack is obviously in the loop when it comes to Conservative Party planning. “Alister Jack has a duty to come forward with the full details of precisely what bets he placed on the election and when the public deserve answers immediately.” When approached for comment, the Tories pointed to Mr Jack’s statement, but the Prime Minister will face pressure to act quickly following criticism of how long it took to suspend Tories accused of being involved in the gambling scandal. On Tuesday night it emerged that Mr George, a member of the Welsh Assembly, is the fifth Tory being looked at by the Gambling Commission. In the Senedd he represents Montgomeryshire – the same area served by Craig Williams, the Conservative MP who has admitted betting on the election.                      Welsh Tory ‘steps back’                    Andrew RT Davies, the Welsh Tory leader, confirmed that Mr George was under investigation and had “stepped back” from his role as deputy chief whip. “All other members of the Welsh Conservative Group have confirmed that they have not placed any bets,” he said in a statement. His announcement came after the Conservatives suspended two MP candidates over allegations that they placed bets on the date of the snap election. The party withdrew support for Mr Williams and Laura Saunders following an internal inquiry into their actions. Ms Saunders is married to Tony Lee, the Tory party’s director of campaigning, who is also being investigated, as is Nick Mason, its head of data.  George Osborne, the former chancellor, said the failure to suspend the two candidates sooner suggested Mr Sunak was not a “real political leader”. Steve Baker, the Northern Ireland minister, called for those who placed bets on the election date to be suspended by the party on Monday night, saying “the Prime Minister would have to answer” for why he had not acted by then. Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Sunak had failed to “grasp the nettle”, telling the Independent on Tuesday: “If they had been my candidates, they’d have been straight out of the door and their feet wouldn’t have touched the floor, but to wait a week, to make excuses like that, is inexcusable.” Later in the day his pledge materialised as the party withdrew support for one of its candidates after being informed that he was being investigated by the Gambling Commission. Kevin Craig later admitted making the bet “a few weeks ago”, saying it had been a “stupid error of judgement” and he had planned to give any winnings to local charities. The party took action so quickly that his campaign team were unaware that he was no longer a candidate when initially contacted by The Telegraph. Mr Craig was selected by Labour to contest Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, a Tory stronghold with a majority of more than 23,000. In a statement he said: “While I did not place this bet with any prior knowledge of the outcome, this was a huge mistake, for which I apologise unreservedly. “I deeply regret what I have done and will take the consequences of this stupid error of judgement on the chin. I will comply fully with the investigation.” Mr Craig, an expert in crisis management, will still appear on the ballot paper for Labour as the legal deadline for registering candidates has passed, but if he wins the constituency on July 4 he will sit in Parliament as an independent MP. A Labour spokesman said: “With Keir Starmer as leader, the Labour Party upholds the highest standards for our parliamentary candidates, as the public rightly expects from any party hoping to serve, which is why we have acted immediately in this case.” It is understood Mr Craig is the only Labour figure the Gambling Commission has been notified about in relation to its election betting investigation. Earlier this month it emerged he had donated £100,000 to the party, sparking accusations that he had bought his candidacy. He separately gave £39,000 to Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, for his work in the role. Sources within the party said it will now give back all the money. The Westminster-based communications company that he founded, PLMR, previously worked on the branding for Responsible Gambling Week. Scotland Yard separately confirmed on Tuesday that five more police officers were being looked at by the Gambling Commission over election bets. Last week, a serving Met officer, who is a member of Mr Sunak’s close protection team, was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office after allegedly placing a bet on the election date. The officer has been placed on restricted duties. Both party leaders are set to face questions on the betting scandal on Wednesday night as they face each other in the final election debate on the BBC.                      25 Jun 2024-09:00PM GMT                                         That’s all for today...

Sir Clive is the principal private secretary to the King and Queen, and the former diplomat is the couple’s most important aide. Rishi Sunak and Sir Ed Davey were also present at the event, along with Kemi Badenoch and Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary.                       25 Jun 2024-08:21PM GMT                                         SNP: Alister Jack must ‘come forward with the full details’ on reported betting claims                    The SNP said Alister Jack has a “duty to come forward with the full details” after it was reported he claimed to have won more than £2,000 betting on the July election date.

Jessica Morden, Welsh Labour Campaign chair, said: “It took Rishi Sunak almost two weeks to take action on one of his Conservative candidates.  “How long will it take Andrew RT Davies to suspend Russell George?”                      25 Jun 2024-07:37PM GMT                                         Why Labour’s electric car crusade risks crushing Britain’s auto industry                    Sir Keir Starmer’s chief of staff, Sue Gray, is said to keep a “s---list” of potential crises that a Labour government may face if the party wins power next week,Matt Oliver writes. Now, the former civil servant may be wearily adding another: the closure of two major UK car factories. The threat issued by Stellantis – the automotive giant behind Vauxhall, Citroen and Peugeot – will be an early test of resolve for a government under Starmer, who currently looks set for a thumping victory on July 4.                       from The Telegraph’s Industry Editor                      here                      25 Jun 2024-07:21PM GMT                                         Car crashes into gates of Chequers estate                    A car has crashed into the barriers at the entrance to Chequers, Rishi Sunak’s official country residence, local police have said. The incident occurred shortly after midday on Tuesday, and the driver has been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and drink driving. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said in a statement: “A white Volkswagen Scirocco hit the barriers at the entrance to Chequers shortly after midday. “The driver, a 44-year-old man from Buckinghamshire, who was the only occupant, suffered serious injuries and has been taken to hospital, where he remains. “He has also been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and drink-driving. “While we are still in the very early stages of our investigation, there is currently no evidence to suggest there was any intention to harm anyone.”                      25 Jun 2024-07:14PM GMT                                         Party leaders wish England luck in Euros match against Slovenia                    Come on England! https://t.co/DLkAsU3FUl Come on England!  https://t.co/CfKrfPjrjk                      25 Jun 2024-07:07PM GMT                                         Dorries: There is a ‘rottenness at the core of the Conservative Pary’                    There is a “rottenness at the core of the Conservative Party” which has been allowed to develop over several years, Nadine Dorries has said. The former Cabinet minister told LBC: “The rebuilding of the Conservative Party, which I know many people in the Conservative Party are talking about now, it has to start from the roots up. “Because there is a rottenness at the core of the Conservative Party which has been allowed to develop over the past number of years, the past six, seven, eight years.” She said the party had to go “back to basics” to rebuild because MPs are coming into Westminster and “expecting to be made a minister within a year”. “We need to reverse what has been a culture of expectation and entitlement and privilege,” Ms Dorries said, adding that she thinks the problems in the Tory Party are also problems for Labour.                      25 Jun 2024-06:55PM GMT                                         Fifth Tory figure being looked into by Gambling Commission                    A fifth Conservative Party figure is being looked into by the Gambling Commission. Russell George MS, a Tory member of the Senedd, represents Montgomeryshire, the same constituency as Craig Williams, who has been suspended from the Conservatives over election bets. In a statement to the Guardian, he said: “Whilst I will cooperate fully with the Gambling Commission, it would not be appropriate to comment on this independent and confidential process. “Doing so would only jeopardise and undermine the investigation. It is the Gambling Commission, not the media, that has the responsibility, powers and resources to properly investigate these matters and determine what, if any, action should be taken. “I have stepped back from the shadow cabinet while the investigation is ongoing. I have done this as I do not wish to be an unnecessary distraction to their work.” Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, confirmed that Mr George had stepped back and added: “All other Members of the Welsh Conservative Group have confirmed that they have not placed any bets.”                      25 Jun 2024-06:44PM GMT                                         Cabinet minister ‘claimed to have won more than £2k on July election bets’                    A Cabinet minister reportedly claimed that he won more than £2,000 betting on a July general election. Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, reportedly told the BBC shortly after Rishi Sunak called the election that he had made £2,100 after betting on June and July election dates. Mr Jack then told the BBC the comments were “a joke” and that he was “pulling your leg”. He then told the broadcaster on Tuesday that he had not placed any bets on the general election date “in May”. Mr Sunak called the election on May 22. In a statement, Mr Jack said: “I am very clear that I have never, on any occasion, broken any Gambling Commission rules. Specifically, I did not place any bets on the date of the General Election during May (the period under investigation by the Gambling Commission). “Furthermore, I am not aware of any family or friends placing bets.” A spokesperson for the Gambling Commission told the BBC: “We are not confirming or denying the identity of any individuals involved in this investigation.”                      25 Jun 2024-06:26PM GMT                                         Former Tory MP says election betters should have ‘book thrown at them’                    Any candidates who bet on the general election “should have the book thrown at them” for being “pretty dumb”, a former Conservative MP has said. Tim Loughton, ex-MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, told Sky News: “It just looks really, really stupid to do something like that so close to home, it can be completely misinterpreted anyway.  “So anybody who has bet in this way should have the book thrown at them, frankly, just for being pretty dumb in what’s happening because it’s not a good look.” He said that the question as to why Mr Sunak hadn’t suspended candidates sooner, Mr Loughton said: “I think it’s a fair question”.                      25 Jun 2024-06:02PM GMT                                         Cleverly demands David Tennant apologise for telling Kemi Badenoch to ‘shut up’                    James Cleverly has voiced his support for Kemi Bednoch amid a row between the Cabinet Secretary and David Tennant. The Doctor Who star said he wanted Mrs Badenoch to “shut up” as he collected an accolade for being a celebrity ally at the British LGBT Awards. He was honoured for his support for the trans community. Ms Badenoch earlier accused him of being a “rich, left, white male celebrity”.  The Home Secretary has also voiced his criticism of Tennant, and has called on him to apologise. He wrote on X: “I’m not sure David understands the irony of trying to silence the voice of the most senior black female politician in the UK’s history, in the name of ‘defending’ a minority community.”                      25 Jun 2024-05:30PM GMT                                         Jeremy Corbyn on course to lose to Labour in Islington North – poll                    Jeremy Corbyn is on course to lose his seat in Islington North to the new Labour candidate, a new poll has predicted.

The former Conservative MP told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme: “Even if it’s not criminal, it’s spectacularly stupid … I would have felt betrayed by the people who work for me making any sort of bet of this sort. “I mean, there are times when it’s appropriate enough to bet on things. I mean, I bet on the Brexit vote because I was so annoyed that people said we were going to lose when I thought we would win, but that wasn’t improper.” He suggested he thought it would probably be “terminal” for the careers of those implicated.                      25 Jun 2024-04:50PM GMT                                         Pictured: Kevin Craig campaigning in the constituency earlier today                    The suspended Labour candidate was campaigning in the Central Suffolk and North Ipswich constituency earlier today, according to a post on his social media.

The former Labour leader told LBC “He never told me that. He never discussed that with me. He endorsed the 2019 manifesto … indeed, we did campaign events together. “I just think we should reflect on our history and be true to ourselves and what we did at the time.” He added: “Okay, his politics have moved on a great deal since then, but, you know, let’s just reflect on that.” On Sir Keir’s suggestion the Tories have launched a Corbyn-style manifesto where “none of it is costed”, Mr Corbyn responded: “Utter nonsense. He knows, you know, I know the whole thing was fully costed.”                      25 Jun 2024-04:10PM GMT                                         Breaking: Labour suspends candidate amid Gambling Commission probe                    A Labour candidate has been suspended after he placed a bet against himself winning in his constituency, The Telegraph understands. Kevin Craig was standing for Labour in the seat of Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, but a party spokeswoman confirmed he had been administratively suspended on Tuesday. The constituency had been held by Dr Dan Poulter, who defected to Labour in April, but won a 23,000-strong majority as the Tory candidate in 2019. A spokeswoman for Labour said after being contacted by the Gambling Commission the party acted immediately to administratively suspend him pending an investigation. She said: “With Keir Starmer as leader, the Labour Party upholds the highest standards for our parliamentary candidates, as the public rightly expects from any party hoping to serve, which is why we have acted immediately in this case.” It comes after two Tory candidates were suspended after they were placed under investigation by the Gambling Commission over betting on the timing of the election.                      25 Jun 2024-03:44PM GMT                                         Pictured: New Tory attack ad warns ‘Keir today.

Steve Baker told Times Radio: “Reform does not have a big base across the country. It’s overwhelmingly led and driven by a tiny number of individuals, and unfortunately, Nigel in particular, too often says things which are too inflaming to certain sensitivities, and he should be more careful with how he deals with issues. The Tory candidate for Wycombe added: “I don’t want to work with him. I don’t, and I know some colleagues want to welcome him in. “But in the diverse country that we have today, and particularly in a diverse community like the one that I represent, one must understand how one will be heard when talking about sensitive issues and I’m afraid Nigel just does not illustrate his capacity to do that.”                      25 Jun 2024-03:05PM GMT                                         Pictured: Sunak, Cleverly and Cameron arrive for state visit of Emperor of Japan                                         25 Jun 2024-02:51PM GMT                                         Labour donor suggests UK ceases farming on three quarters of nation’s farmland                    One of Labour’s donors has suggested that the UK should cease farming on three quarters of the country’s farmland in order to “give back to nature”. Dale Vince, who has given more than £5 million to Labour’s general election war chest, described farming livestock as an “inefficient system”. Citing the statistic that farmland “takes up 75 per cent of our country”, he said last week: “If we all stop eating animals today, tomorrow, whenever in our country, we can free up 75 per cent of that farmland, right? “And that 75 per cent of 75 per cent, do the maths, that’s half of our entire country that we can give back to nature.” Steve Barclay, the Environment Secretary, said: “With Labour’s biggest backers wanting to close down farms to rewild them it is clear they simply have no idea about our rural communities.” A Labour spokesman said: “This is not Labour policy and to suggest so is nonsense. We will take no lessons from the Conservative who have abandoned our farmers.”                      25 Jun 2024-02:34PM GMT                                         Watch: Suspended Tory MP makes statement asking voters to still back him                    Statement pic.twitter.com/bXoQm8ARRy                      25 Jun 2024-02:04PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak’s Facebook page has not put a single new ad out since May                    Rishi Sunak’s Facebook page has not put a single paid advert out since the end of May, in contrast to those of Sir Keir Starmer and Nigel Farage,Dominic Penna writes. No new campaigns have appeared in the Prime Minister’s name on the social media giant since a two-minute montage promoted in the week after he called the general election.

The former chancellor, speaking on his Political Currency podcast, said the Tories’ excuses for initially failing to suspend two candidates over election bets had been “pathetic”. His remarks, broadcast on Tuesday, were recorded before the Tories withdrew support from Craig Williams and Laura Saunders under heavy pressure from Labour. He said: “What Rishi Sunak consistently fails to do is take difficult situations and try and turn them, if not to your advantage, at least to try and illustrate some of your strengths.  “When you’re in a room and you’ve got a scandal emerging you’ve got a choice which is to try and muddle through, and it almost always never works. “You think you can hide away and that’s presumably what Sunak’s thinking. “Or you try and turn the thing into a moment for you. That’s the kind of raw instinct that I think real political leaders, real strong prime ministers have.”                      25 Jun 2024-01:32PM GMT                                         Pictured: Liz Truss on the campaign trail                                         25 Jun 2024-01:21PM GMT                                         Sunak looks like Major in run-up to 1997 Labour landslide, suggests Kwarteng                    Rishi Sunak looks like Sir John Major in the run-up to the 1997 general election when “everyone knew what the result would be”, Kwasi Kwarteng has suggested.  Mr Kwarteng, a former chancellor, said this year’s election campaign  reminded him of the period before Sir Tony Blair’s New Labour landslide. The senior Tory – who is not standing at the election  – said there “could still be surprises” ahead of polling day on July 4, but believed that “you can see where the thing is going”. Mr Kwarteng also admitted that he felt “partially responsible” for the Conservative Party’s dire position in the polls , but said Mr Sunak must take most of the blame.

The party pledged in its manifesto to eventually take the UK back into the European single market. It also said its “longer-term objective” was EU membership.  Asked why the Lib Dems did not simply pledge to rejoin the EU, Sir Ed told the BBC it will “take a little while to rebuild that relationship”.  He said: “I don’t want to take the county back to those Brexit years where we had all of that debate and we were divided.  “I think we have got to build that relationship, slowly and gradually and properly to build the foundations.”  Sir Ed said he believed a better trade deal with the EU would be possible in the short to medium term but that would stop short of single market membership.                      25 Jun 2024-12:52PM GMT                                         Sir Ed Davey defends use of election campaign stunts                    Sir Ed Davey defended the Lib Dems’ use of political stunts to gain publicity.  The Lib Dem leader has been photographed paddle boarding, tackling an obstacle course and enjoying a roller coaster during the general election campaign.  Sir Ed said he believed it was fine for him not to “take myself too seriously” as long as his party was taking people’s concerns seriously.  Gaining publicity through stunts enabled the party to get its “serious messages over better”, he told BBC Radio 2 this afternoon.                      25 Jun 2024-12:44PM GMT                                         Pictured: Sarwar and Reeves visit whisky bottling plant in West Dunbartonshire                                         25 Jun 2024-12:36PM GMT                                         JK Rowling agrees to meet Labour, but sets conditions                    JK Rowling has agreed to meet Labour  on the condition that Angela Rayner apologises for endorsing a charter that described two organisations, Woman’s Place and the LGB Alliance, as “hate groups”. At the weekend, the Harry Potter author claimed  that Labour had “abandoned” women and she would “struggle to support” Sir Keir Starmer’s party at the general election  because of its transgender stance. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, responded by offering her a meeting to provide “assurances” over the protection of women-only spaces. Responding to Ms Reeves’ remarks, Ms Rowling said: “I’ll be happy to meet after Keep Prisons Single Sex, Lesbian Labour, Women’s Rights Network, Woman’s Place and the LGB Alliance have been given in-person meetings with the Labour leadership. “I’d also like to know whether Angela Rayner still considers the last two organisations hate groups – asking on behalf of female survivors of domestic violence and gay people who don’t subscribe to gender identity ideology.”                      You can read the full story                      here                      .                                          25 Jun 2024-12:26PM GMT                                         Starmer reveals his children are ‘worried’ about possible No 10 move                    Sir Keir Starmer’s children will move into Downing Street with him if he wins the election but are “worried” about the prospect, the Labour leader has said. Appearing on ITV’s This Morning, Sir Keir said he and his wife Victoria would “fiercely protect” their teenage children’s privacy, but admitted he and they were still worried about the impact of a possible move to Number 10. He said: “They are worried, if I’m honest. They are worried about it, because, I think any parent would understand this, if you are a teenage child you don’t want things to change. “You’ve got things set up at home exactly as you want them, you’ve got your friends, you’ve got your routines and you’re got your first little bits of independence, what you do after school. “It may not be a big thing but it’s the first (time), you can do what you want with your friends after school for a limited amount of time, whatever it may be.

Mr Farage, the Reform UK leader , accompanied by reporters, took a catamaran into the Channel as he set out his party’s plans for stopping the boats. Within three hours of it going to sea, a dinghy packed with 45 migrants was spotted approaching the Channel’s 12-mile midpoint, having been escorted across the still waters from the north of France  by the Minck, a rescue vessel contracted to the French Navy.

The actor and campaigner said they had a “very important” meeting with families of victims and campaign organisations to discuss “what we need to do as a country to fight this”. Speaking in a video posted to Instagram afterwards, Elba said: “We had a very wide conversation about what we need to do as a country to fight this. It was non-political, and I’m making that clear because this is a societal issue. “But as someone that might be taking the hot seat, it was really important to hear what he had to say about his plans… Today he listened. He listened to what the organisations … had to say.” Elba said he was there “as a concerned parent, concerned citizen”. “It was important that we have some clear guidelines on how this might go forward, we have clear ambition for it to be a cross-party scenario, so that whether he gets in or not, we are trying to get both sides of the political agenda to look at this, because it’s something that affects all of our society.”                      25 Jun 2024-11:16AM GMT                                         Starmer backing England team ‘all the way’                    Sir Keir Starmer has leant his support to the England football team amid criticism from veteran former players of their performance so far at the Euros.

He said: “We are going to have to deal with knife crime offenders, they need consequences for carrying a knife. And we’re going to have to mend the system when it comes to prisons. “It’s plain common sense that nobody can build a prison in the first week of the Labour government. Get on with the problem, get on with rebuilding, not just our prisons, but our country, because almost everything now is broken under this Government.”                      25 Jun 2024-10:45AM GMT                                         Starmer hits back at Atkins over trans self ID attack                    Sir Keir Starmer has hit back at Victoria Atkins, the Health Secretary, after she accused Labour of trying to introduce self ID for trans people “by the back door” (see the post below at 10.06).

He told reporters: “The Government has announced 16 times that they’re going to ban the online sale of zombie knives. We as the opposition said we support this, bring the legislation, it will go through, they haven’t done it. Knife crime now is up 81 per cent since 2015.” He added : “It’s a problem that we all have responsibilities for so legislation on knives is a Government issue and the Government has failed on this issue. We will not fail on this issue. There are other measures, one of the families here their son was murdered by a knife that was sent through the post by a shop, ordered online in ordinary packaging and picked up by a 15-year-old who didn’t need to show any identification. “It’s not rocket science.

The man who would like to be foreign secretary called women ‘dinosaurs’ ‘hoarding rights’ and the man who wishes to lead the health service and therefore maternity services said people asking reasonable questions should just ‘get over it’. “Now we discover that the Labour Party want to dilute women’s rights further through their plans to introduce self-identification by the back door. “Currently someone who wants to change their legal sex has to live in their acquired gender for at least two years before their application is scrutinised by a panel made up of medical practitioners and qualified legal members. Labour want to abolish this panel and the safeguards it represents.” It emerged yesterday that Labour plans to make it easier  for people to change gender.                       25 Jun 2024-08:51AM GMT                                         Small boat migrants ‘absolutely’ do check election opinion polls, says Cleverly                    James Cleverly said migrants in northern France are “absolutely” following general election polling because the outcome on July 4 could impact their chances of staying in the UK.  The Telegraph revealed overnight  that some migrants are waiting for a Labour government to get in and scrap the Rwanda flights before making the crossing.  Asked if he believed migrants and people smugglers were checking the opinion polls, Mr Cleverly, the Home Secretary, told LBC: “They absolutely do... we know that this is a digitally-enabled criminal enterprise.  “The people smugglers and the people that seek to be smuggled pay very, very close attention to a whole range of things and it is clear from these quotes that there is a cohort of people currently in France who are waiting for Rwanda to be taken off the table before coming over here. These quotes in The Telegraph make it really clear.”  Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said migrants would be “disappointed” if they believed they would get an easy ride under a Labour government.  She said: “I think people are going to be disappointed if they think that because Labour is going to introduce a new Border Security Command that will smash the criminal gang networks that are currently organising these dangerous boat crossings that are undermining our border security and putting lives at risk.”                      25 Jun 2024-08:37AM GMT                                         Cleverly and Cooper clash over Labour plan for closer working with EU on immigration                    James Cleverly claimed Labour’s plan to increase cooperation with the EU on tackling illegal immigration would result in the UK having to accept more people from the continent.  Ms Cooper told an LBC debate on immigration this morning: “We have said very clearly we won’t join the EU member states’ quota scheme. That wouldn’t be right for the UK.  “What we should be doing is sharing intelligence on things like who has already claimed asylum and been turned down in other countries. At the moment we don’t know that so we can’t even then swiftly return them.” Mr Cleverly said: “The arrangement that you are talking about will inevitably mean the UK becomes a net recipient of illegal migrants. We estimate about 100,000 additional people.”  Ms Cooper said the 100,000 figure was “invented” and “total garbage”.                       25 Jun 2024-08:27AM GMT                                         Cleverly: Labour had ‘road to Damascus-style conversion’ on cutting net migration                    James Cleverly claimed Labour had undergone a “road to Damascus-style conversion” with its commitment to cut net migration.  The Home Secretary said: “They talk about wanting to bring this down but this is a road to Damascus-style conversion now that there is an election on and the measures that I have already taken will reduce by about 300,000, so 300,000 fewer people will be eligible to come under the arrangements that I have put in place compared with previously and this was opposed by Labour over and over again.”  Responding during a debate on LBC this morning, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said Mr Cleverly’s claim that Labour had opposed all of the Government’s migration measures was “simply made up”.                       25 Jun 2024-08:20AM GMT                                         Labour promises ‘significant reduction’ in net migration-but won’t set a target                    Yvette Cooper said a Labour government would deliver a “significant reduction” in net migration-but she refused to set a numerical target.  The shadow home secretary told LBC that a Labour government would cut net migration and when asked by how much, she replied: “We don’t think it is right to have a particular number target.  “We do think it is right to have a significant reduction and we do think that net migration needs to come down and we have set out a plan to reduce it.”  Asked what “significant” actually means, the Labour frontbencher said: “We have seen repeated Conservative governments set these targets that then end up being discredited and we think it is important to build confidence in the system and to be serious.”                      25 Jun 2024-08:15AM GMT                                         Tories adopted ‘laissez fair approach’ to immigration, claims Cooper                    Yvette Cooper said the Tories had introduced three different laws to tackle the small boats crisis but the shadow home secretary argued they had “all just made the chaos worse”.  A caller asked what each of the main parties would do to bring down net migration.  Ms Cooper claimed the Tories had failed to tackle skills shortages in the UK and had adopted a “free market laissez faire approach” to migration.  “It has been a failure on both the economy and migration,” the shadow home secretary said.                       25 Jun 2024-08:09AM GMT                                         Yvette Cooper: Immigration ‘chaos’ has got ‘worse, and worse and worse’ under Tories                    James Cleverly and Yvette Cooper were each asked why voters should put their trust in them to run the Home Office.  Mr Cleverly, the Home Secretary, said this general election “is a choice”. The Tories have “committed to bringing down levels of immigration which have been too high”, he said, as he reiterated the Conservative pledge to stop the boats.  He said that was in “stark contrast” to Labour who had “voted against these measures time and time again”.  Ms Cooper said that “everything is broken” and that under the Tories “net migration has trebled” in recent years.  Pointing to ministerial turnover at the Home Office, she said that under the Conservatives the “chaos has just got worse, and worse and worse”.                       25 Jun 2024-08:03AM GMT                                         Coming up: Cleverly and Cooper clash in immigration debate                    James Cleverly, the Home Secretary, and his Labour shadow Yvette Cooper are set to square off in a radio debate on immigration.  The pair will take part in an event hosted by LBC imminently. I will do my best to guide you through the key exchanges.                      25 Jun 2024-08:01AM GMT                                         Public finances may be ‘even worse’ than feared, says Labour frontbencher                    The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will have a different view of the economy by the time of the autumn budget, Labour frontbencher Nick Thomas-Symonds has said. Mr Thomas-Symonds said Labour could “open the books and discover the situation is even worse than it is at the moment”.  It comes after the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) cast doubt on the spending plans laid out by both Labour and the Conservatives. Mr Thomas-Symonds, the shadow minister without portfolio, told Times Radio: “Obviously the Government is in a very different position from us, because, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies set out, there are no specific departmental spending plans beyond March of 2025 that’s because the Government hasn’t conducted a spending review. “We obviously can’t do that from opposition, and we’ve also been open, always that we may open the books and discover the situation is even worse than it is at the moment. We’ve never hidden from that.” Asked if Labour would have to raise taxes, cut spending or borrow more, Mr Thomas-Symonds said: “We will put that plan on the table, of stability, of investment and of reform. The Office of Budget Responsibility will then look at it so it will be robust, and the snapshot in the autumn will be different. It will then be about growth. “And that is why, by the way, so that we don’t have to make these trade-offs. We don’t have to get into this doom loop that the Conservatives have been in.”                      25 Jun 2024-07:34AM GMT                                         Voters now seeing ‘fruits of Sunak’s hard work’, says minister                    People are beginning to see the “fruits of the hard work” Rishi Sunak has done to improve the economy, Home Office minister Michael Tomlinson said this morning.  Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said both Labour and the Conservatives were engaged in a “conspiracy of silence” on their spending plans. Mr Tomlinson told Times Radio: “That is also according to the IFS [Labour] would drag us into the tax burden at its highest level in British history. “But when the manifesto was launched, and I was there, when it was launched there are two documents that were produced. There was the manifesto itself, and there was a separate costing document, as you would expect, and as the Prime Minister has said, each and every one of our measures is fully costed. “You’ve begun to see, I think, the economy turning a corner. You’ve begun to see the fruits of the hard work that the Prime Minister has put in with inflation falling from over 11 per cent back down to 2 per cent to normal levels, we’ve got interest rates cut just around the corner, and we’re beginning to see the economy turning the corner, and all of our measures within our manifesto are fully costed.”                      25 Jun 2024-07:31AM GMT                                         Kwarteng feels ‘partially responsible’ for Tory struggles                    Kwasi Kwarteng said he feels “partially responsible” for the position the Conservative Party currently finds itself in.  But he made clear Rishi Sunak and others in the party also needed to shoulder the blame for the Tories being so far behind Labour in the opinion polls.  Mr Kwarteng delivered Liz Truss’s mini-Budget in September 2022 which ultimately led to the chaotic end of her premiership the following month.  Asked if he felt responsible for the Tories’ current position, the former chancellor told GB News: “I feel partially responsible but I don’t feel responsible for leaving D-Day early, I don’t feel responsible for the Reform party which was on 4 per cent in October 2022 being on nearly 20 per cent now.  “I don’t feel responsible for the election betting scandal nor do I feel responsible for the fact that this election has happened way before anyone was expecting it.”                       25 Jun 2024-07:20AM GMT                                         Sunak looks defeated like Major in 1997, suggests Kwarteng                    Rishi Sunak looks like Sir John Major in the run up to the 1997 general election when “everyone knew what the result would be”, Kwasi Kwarteng has suggested.  The former chancellor said the 2024 election campaign reminded him of the 1997 Labour landslide.  The senior Tory, who is not standing at the election, said there “could still be surprises” ahead of polling day on July 4 but he believed “you can see where the thing is going”.  It was suggested to Mr Kwarteng during an interview on GB News that Mr Sunak was campaigning every day despite knowing that he is not going to win.  Mr Kwarteng replied: “I think it is very difficult for him, for any prime minister. The only thing I can remember which is similar was 1997 when you kind of knew that Labour would get in and I think John Major and the Cabinet, they looked pretty tired and they were going out to campaign and everyone knew what the result would be.  “It feels a bit like that this year. There could still be surprises, we don’t know. But at the moment, when you have got Cabinet ministers warning about Labour supermajorities, I think Jeremy Hunt and Grant Shapps have mentioned that, you can see where the thing is going.”                       25 Jun 2024-07:00AM GMT                                         Minister wants election gambling investigations to conclude ‘as quickly as possible’                    Michael Tomlinson said he wanted the investigations into the Tory general election betting scandal to be finished “swiftly”.  The Gambling Commission is looking into the allegations while the Conservative Party is also conducting its own internal inquiry.  The minister for countering illegal migration told Sky News: “I want this to happen as quickly as possible. I want it to happen swiftly. And I want anyone who is found to have broken the rules, to have broken the law, to be dealt with severely.”                      25 Jun 2024-06:46AM GMT                                         Starmer turns election campaign focus to tackling knife crime                    It is our duty as political leaders across all parties to work together to end knife crime and keep our young people safe.                      25 Jun 2024-06:40AM GMT                                         Migrants waiting for Labour government ‘evidence of Rwanda deterrent effect’, says minister                    Migrants in northern France who are waiting for a Labour government to axe the Rwanda plan before crossing the Channel are “evidence of the deterrent effect” of the deportation flights plan, Michael Tomlinson said this morning. The Telegraph revealed overnight  that some of the migrants have said they would not take the risk of crossing the Channel in small boats until they knew there was a new government.  Mr Tomlinson, the minister for countering illegal migration, told Times Radio: “The deterrent is not fully in place, but we’re already seeing the effects of that deterrent, and we’ve seen overnight the breaking news from The Telegraph on the front pages, where there are those who are in northern France, who are waiting, delaying their journey because they do not like the Rwanda scheme, they do not want to be deported to Rwanda. “And people have been asking me for weeks, for months, where is the evidence of the deterrent effect? Well, there it is, writ large.”                      25 Jun 2024-06:35AM GMT                                         Minister ‘shares frustration’ of Tory candidate who labelled party ‘a shower of s---’                    A minister said he shared the “anger” and “frustration” of a Tory candidate who labelled the Conservative Party “a shower of s---”.  James Cracknell, a former Olympic rower who is standing in Colchester, made the comment  in a campaign video as he referenced the Tory general election betting scandal.  Michael Tomlinson, the minister for countering illegal migration, told Times Radio when asked about the remark: “I share the anger, I share the frustration… what I would say is that the lawyer in me says that there is a process and a procedure that should be gone through.  “My view is that that should be swift and that anyone who is found to have fallen short of the high standards we expect, anyone that is found to have broken the law, should be dealt with swiftly and severely. That is my view.”                       25 Jun 2024-06:25AM GMT                                         Tories have failed to stop the boats, admits illegal migration minister                    The minister for countering illegal migration admitted the Tories have failed to “stop the boats”.  Rishi Sunak made his original pledge in a speech in January 2023 but crossings have continued and Home Office data published yesterday showed the number of small boat arrivals in 2024 had hit a new record high for the first six months of a calendar year. Told that Mr Sunak and the Tories had not stopped the boats, Michael Tomlinson told Times Radio: “That is right. We have not. “We have made progress. Let me put this in context. Year on year, so rolling year to date or to last week we are still down by a third, so we are making progress.  “And the second thing I’d say… is our Rwanda scheme. It is important to have a deterrent in place, as yet that deterrent is not fully in place. But we are already seeing the effects of that deterrent.”                      25 Jun 2024-06:14AM GMT                                         Labour poll lead over Tories narrows to 24 points                    Labour’s lead over the Tories has fallen by three points in a week but still stands at a sizeable 24 points, according to a new survey by Deltapoll. The poll, conducted between June 21-24, put Labour on 43 per cent and the Tories on 19 per cent.  Labour was down by three points while the Conservative Party was unchanged when compared to the company’s previous poll conducted between June 14-17.  Reform UK was down by one point to 15 per cent while the Liberal Democrats were up by three points to 13 per cent.  New Voting IntentionLabour lead by 24 points in our latest poll.

A Redfield & Wilton Strategies survey conducted between June 21-24 found that just 35 per cent of 2019 Conservative supporters are planning to vote for the party again.  Redfield said that was the lowest percentage it had ever recorded and it was two points lower than the previous nadir of 37 per cent which was most recently recorded last week.  Some 28 per cent of 2019 Tory voters now said they will vote for Reform UK while 19 per cent said they will vote for Labour.  The numbers represent a setback for Rishi Sunak as he tries to build momentum for his party with polling day now just over one week away.

James Cleverly and Yvette Cooper will clash over immigration this morning with just nine days remaining until Britain goes to the polls. The Home Secretary and his Labour shadow will take part in a head-to-head debate hosted by LBC’s Nick Ferrari with the Government’s Rwanda plan, recent record levels of net migration and much more on the agenda. It comes as Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, meets the families of knife crime victims and outlines his plan to halve knife crime in the next decade if elected. Sir Keir said overnight the issue would be “a moral mission for the next Labour government”, promising to “take the strongest action in a generation”. North of the border, Rachel Reeves, Sir Keir’s shadow chancellor, will meet Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, as they pay a visit to a major business in Dunbartonshire. Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak will continue his attempts to revive the Tory campaign in the wake of a rally on Monday night that saw him warn voters they had “10 days to save Britain” from Labour rule.                      25 Jun 2024-05:34AM GMT                                         Hopefully voters ‘not too fed up’ with Tories on July 4, says Keegan                    Gillian Keegan said she hoped voters were “not too fed up” with the Tories and would “give us another shot” on July 4.  The Education Secretary told Sky News: “I think it is a big question for the country. Somebody [Rishi Sunak] that has a plan, that has thought things through, and somebody [Sir Keir Starmer] who has got slogans.  “And I hope that they are not too fed up with us that they give us another shot because we do have the right ideas for the country and it will make a big difference if we have a bit more time to put the country back to rights.”                      25 Jun 2024-05:32AM GMT                                         Gillian Keegan: Timing of betting scandal is ‘terrible’ for Tories                    Gillian Keegan said the timing of the general election betting scandal was “terrible” for the Conservative Party.  The Education Secretary said she hoped investigations into the claims would be concluded “quickly” but stressed the need for “due process” to be followed.  She told Sky News: “Those things, hopefully they can be done quite quickly, I don’t know what the timescales are. “But to be fair you do need to allow people to have due process and that will actually be determining then what follows, what actions need to be taken. You do have to put them in that order. That is pretty normal to put them in that order.  “I understand the timing is terrible. It is terrible for Rishi himself and he is obviously very angry about it as we all are. But you do have to get the facts established and then take the appropriate action based on what they tell us that is.”  Load-Date: June 26, 2024  End of Document
