   Labour’s manifesto puts Starmer in spending ‘straitjacket’, warns Ed Balls telegraph.co.uk June 13, 2024 Thursday 7:34 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 14312 words Byline: By Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor and Dominic Penna, Political Correspondent and Nick Gutteridge, Chief Political Correspondent Body   Follow our live coverage of the ITV election debate here                                             Labour’s “straitjacket” manifesto would make Sir Keir Starmer’s first year in office very difficult, Ed Balls has warned.Sir Keir has explicitly ruled out any rises in income tax, National Insurance and VAT under a Labour government.Speaking on his Political Currency podcast, Mr Balls, a former Labour shadow chancellor, said the Labour leader and Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, face “huge expectations” while giving themselves “little room for manoeuvre”.“I think people will look back on this manifesto, which is now seen as cautious and careful, and think of it as being something which was very constraining, and a potentially risky thing to do for Labour because this manifesto is absolutely boxing Labour in,” he said.“It will be seen as a straitjacket, with tough fiscal rules and limits on borrowing, big commitments not to raise income tax or VAT or national insurance.”For Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves there are huge expectations, no money, little room for manoeuvre, inherited plans which are very tight, and an economy which isn’t growing. So I think that creates a big set of expectations and that is the consequence of the manifesto strategy. This manifesto makes the first year in government for Labour very difficult.”The party’s plans to raise taxes by more than £8 billion a year, coupled with the £23.5 billion post-election tax hikes already announced by Jeremy Hunt, would leave households facing a £1,100-a-year tax rise, according to the Resolution Foundation, a Left-wing think tank.You can follow the latest updates below and join the  conversation in the comments section  here.

But he has to account for himself to the Gambling Commission and his constituents.”13 Jun 2024-06:16PM GMTKeir Starmer: Net migration must fall ‘substantially’Sir Keir Starmer said net migration must fall “substantially” but he refused to put an “arbitrary figure” on his desired level.Speaking to GB News, Sir Keir said: “I want it to come down substantially. I’m not going to put an arbitrary figure on it.“That’s been done in pretty well every Conservative manifesto for the last few elections and the one thing that is common in those manifestos is the number has ever been hit.“So I’m not going to put an arbitrary figure, I am going to say the numbers need to come down, they need to come down substantially. They’re way higher now than they’ve been ever before. They need to come down. The way to bring them down is to make sure the underlying drivers such as the skills shortage is dealt with. So that’s what we want to do.”13 Jun 2024-06:11PM GMTLord Frost: Starmer’s plan for growth is built on a dangerous fantasyI listened to Sir Keir Starmer claiming the Labour manifesto was about economic growth. Once I’d stopped laughing, I couldn’t help thinking of an old episode of Yes Minister in which Jim Hacker is given the job of “transport supremo”, writesDavid Frost.His first set of ideas, to rationalise and reform Britain’s transport system, is spiked by the PM because of the effects on his own constituency. Realising he must get rid of the job, Hacker turns despairingly to Sir Humphrey.“Don’t worry, minister. We now produce the other kind of proposal – the high cost high bureaucracy one. A British National Transport Authority, regional boards, area councils, committees, the lot. Everyone will have a fit. And the job will go back to the Department of Transport.”And so Labour will behave. Having scorned Liz Truss’s attempt to jolt the economy into growth, Labour thinks that it can achieve wealth creation by direction and control instead.One of the many achievements of the Tory governments of the 1980s and 1990s was to ensure that such ideas got the mockery they deserved. But since Gordon Brown’s time, they have crept back, and they reached their zenith in the Labour approach announced yesterday.David Frost: The world of lockdowns and busybodies is Labour’s inspiration 13 Jun 2024-06:03PM GMTTaxi for TiceThis from the Reform party chairman:Taxi anyone…….Great day campaigning in Boston & Skegness⁦@reformparty_uk ⁩ pic.twitter.com/2PyZUcQmBA — Richard Tice  (@TiceRichard) June 13, 2024 13 Jun 2024-06:03PM GMTGreen Party takes manifesto offline after HIV backlashThe Green Party has taken its manifesto offline amid a backlash to its depiction of HIV.An easy-read version of the document accompanied a pledge to end HIV transmissions by 2030 with a photograph of a man looking visibly unwell and coughing.A Green Party spokesperson told Sky News: “Soon after publication we were alerted to how an image we used in our easy read manifesto could be misinterpreted. “For clarity we temporarily took the manifesto down to replace this image with a more suitable image that better communicates our policy to work towards no more HIV transmissions by 2030.” 13 Jun 2024-05:58PM GMTKeir Starmer: We will implement Cass review in fullSir Keir Starmer has promised to implement the findings of the Cass review in full.The landmark report by paediatric consultant Dr Hillary Cass was published in April and concluded that children who think they are transgender should not be rushed into treatment they may regret.Its 32 recommendations included calling for the “unhurried” care of those under 25 who think they may be transgender; an end to the prescribing of powerful hormone drugs to under-18s; and early help for primary school children who want to socially transition.Asked whether the Cass review would be introduced in its entirety, Sir Keir said: “Yes, and that is what our manifesto says.”13 Jun 2024-05:52PM GMTStarmer: ‘Everything’ about Brexit deal will need negotiation“Everything” about Britain’s deal with the European Union will have to be negotiated, Sir Keir Starmer has said.Speaking on LBC’s Tonight with Andrew Marr, Sir Keir said: “I think with the deal that we’ve got that Boris Johnson negotiated, we got a botched deal and that has had an impact. That’s why what you seen in our manifesto today, as part of our growth plan, is a better deal with the EU.“That is an essential part of our growth plan to make trading easier, to ensure we can do some of the research and development that we need and the education, but also crucially in the area of defence and security. I accept that we’ve got a botched deal that Boris Johnson inflicted on us-we can do better than that and that is essential for the future plans for creating wealth and growing our economy.”Sir Keir insisted “not all roads lead to a relationship” with Brussels, but when asked if his ambition went beyond a veterinary agreement, he said: “Everything is going to have to be negotiated. I do think we got a botched deal. I think we could do better. A veterinary agreement would make it much easier to trade. That would also lesser the tensions in relation to the situation with Northern Ireland.”The Labour leader said the UK “should do whatever we can to make it easy for people to travel on holiday, get into the continent and back... Of course we will do anything to make it easier for anybody to holiday, whether it’s in Europe or abroad.”13 Jun 2024-05:37PM GMTSunak on the move13 Jun 2024-05:28PM GMTCorbyn accuses Starmer of ‘rewriting history’Jeremy Corbyn has accused Sir Keir Starmer of “rewriting history” after the Labour leader said he did not think his party would win the 2019 general election, writesNatasha Leake.In an interview with Beth Rigby on Sky on Wednesday, Sir Keir was questioned over his support for his predecessor in 2019 and his subsequent attempts to distance the party from Mr Corbyn. Sir Keir said he was “certain” Labour would lose the election but made “no apology” for backing Mr Corbyn at the time.Mr Corbyn has now accused Sir Keir of “double standards”, saying: “Well, he never said that to me, at any time. And so I just think rewriting history is no help.”He added: “It shows double standards, shall we say, that he now says he always thought that, but he never said it at the time, or anything about it. He was part of the campaign. He and I spoke together at events and I find it actually quite sad.“Get over it and get on with it. He was in the shadow cabinet, he was at the Clause 5 meeting. Both those meetings unanimously agreed the 2019 manifesto, and he was there.”13 Jun 2024-05:26PM GMTCorbyn manifesto ‘a smorgasbord of offers we couldn’t afford’Speaking to The Telegraph’s Kamal Ahmed, David Lammy, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, has admitted the 2019 Labour manifesto was “a smorgasbord of offers we couldn’t afford”:️ 'He recognised Corbyn's manifesto was a smorgasbord of offers we couldn't afford'@kamalahmednews  asks @DavidLammy  about Starmer's-and his own-change of heart regarding Jeremy Corbyn Listen: https://t.co/5ntJ1ZAqoZ pic.twitter.com/5Gfcj9QuVK — The Daily T (@DailyTPodcast) June 13, 2024 13 Jun 2024-05:21PM GMTLabour must not leave anyone behind on net zero journey, urge gas firmsLabour’s green policies must “bring everyone on the net zero journey”, gas networks have urged tonight.A spokesman for the Gas Distribution Networks said: “We share in Labour’s drive to preserve the UK’s energy security and become a world-leader in cutting-edge technologies of the future like hydrogen and biomethane.“Our world-class gas network will be vital to achieving both ambitions-plugging the gap when renewables can’t meet demand and carrying hydrogen to power industry and keep homes warm.“Above all, we need to ensure that plans for our future energy system bring everyone on the net zero journey, no matter their income or circumstances, as we drive towards becoming a world-leader in low-carbon innovation.”13 Jun 2024-05:11PM GMTDowning Street readout of Sunak’s meeting with ZelenskyRishi Sunak has met Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the G7 summit.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Prime Minister met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this afternoon at the G7 Summit in Italy.“Both leaders welcomed G7 efforts to provide Ukraine with significant new funding, enabled by the profits from frozen Russian assets, and to keep working further on avenues to use the frozen assets themselves.“The Prime Minister reiterated the UK’s steadfast support for Ukraine’s right to self-defence in the face of Russia’s illegal invasion. The President thanked the Prime Minister for his support for Ukraine’s peace initiative and the two leaders looked forward to seeing each other at the Peace Summit in Switzerland this weekend.”13 Jun 2024-05:04PM GMTPrivate schools should ‘cut their cloth’, says Bridget PhillipsonAsked whether parents who cannot afford a 20 per cent increase in fees take their children outside of private schools before September, Bridget Phillipson told Sky News: “We’ve made this position clear for some time, it has been Labour Party policy for a long period of time.“I think this is a straightforward, fair choice in terms of choosing to prioritise investment in state education, where 93 per cent of our children will go to school, the vast majority of your viewers will send their children to the local school. They want investment in more teachers and more mental health support.”Pressed again on the question she was asked, and challenged on when fees would increase, Ms Phillipson said it was a “matter for a fiscal event”.“Private schools have had ample time to prepare. There is no requirement for them to pass this on to parents. But I would also just add that fees have gone up year-on-year, way beyond inflation, and there hasn’t been a change in terms of numbers. So I think that private schools should frankly cut their cloth and make decisions around how they manage their budget.”On her message to parents who cannot send their children to private schools, she replied: “I respect the rights of parents to choose where they send their children to be educated but my focus if I were education secretary would be on driving up standards in the state sector. That’s where the majority of children go, that’s where we make the biggest difference to life chances.”13 Jun 2024-04:55PM GMTShadow education secretary: Labour will have absolute focus on growthBridget Phillipson was asked about OECD forecasts predicting economic growth of around one per cent in 2025, below the rest of the G7.“As things stand they are pretty [dire], on the current trajectory, but what people will have on July 4 is the opportunity to vote for change and the chance for things to be different.”Asked what would happen if Labour’s growth plan failed, she replied: “Rachel Reeves has set out our fiscal rules that will govern the work of our next Labour government, and we have been clear we will not cut income tax, National Insurance or VAT on working people.“We will have an absolute focus on growth. We haven’t had that under the Conservatives. I can see no reason why Britain cannot be better than it is right now. Other countries manage to secure economic growth, we’ve done it before and we will do it again.”13 Jun 2024-04:53PM GMTBridget Phillipson: Our manifesto is an ‘ambitious’ plan for BritainBridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, rejected a Sky News interviewer’s claim Labour had “modest spending plans”.“The plan we set out today with that manifesto is an ambitious programme for how we can get our country’s future back. How we can make sure we are tackling those NHS waiting lists, getting more police on our streets, getting more teachers in our classrooms. But most importantly, to get some hope and optimism back to our country.“We do believe it’s important that everything we’ve set out in our manifesto is fully-costed and fully-funded with a plan to make it happen...”Asked about hitting waiting list and early diagnosis targets before the end of the next parliament, and most people in the NHS thinking this needed extra funding, Ms Phillipson replied: “That’s why our priority is to get the economy growing. We’ve got to focus on growing our economy. The answer cannot be, as it has been under the Conservatives, asking working people to pay ever more in taxation.”13 Jun 2024-04:38PM GMTStarmer: My toolmaker father would turn in his grave over audience laughterSir Keir Starmer said his father would have “turned in his grave” when somebody laughed at the Labour leader mentioning that he was a toolmaker during the Sky leaders’ event last night.The Labour leader told GB News his father felt “disrespected” by people during his working life because he worked in a factory.“It hit a nerve last night. He felt that-in the usual conversation when someone says ‘what do you do for a living?’ when socially, he would say ‘I work in a factory’, and there would be a pause, and nobody quite knew what to say.“And he felt really disrespected. It caused him in his life to withdraw from social engagements. He didn’t do it much later in life, because it was raw to him that he should be disrespected because he worked in a factory. So when someone laughed last night, my Dad that would have turned in his grave.”Sir Keir has regularly mentioned his dad worked as a toolmaker in the past couple of years.13 Jun 2024-04:35PM GMTTories reach all-time poll lowThe Conservatives have reached their all-time polling low with Redfield & Wilton Strategies, falling to 18 per cent and just one point ahead of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.Labour is on 42 per cent, the Tories 18 per cent, Reform 17 per cent and the Liberal Democrats 13 per cent in the firm’s latest survey:Labour leads by 24%.Lowest EVER Conservative % (worse than Truss).Highest Lib Dem % in 2024.

From an 80-seat majority to 80 seats. It’s not easy to squander that much popular support that quickly, but the Tories have given it their best shot.Cast your minds back four and a half years. Who can forget the surge of joy and relief when the exit poll flashed up on the BBC and we knew that the Corbynbeast was slain? It was the luckiest Friday the 13th ever..People from every region and all political persuasions had pulled together to save Britain, and it felt amazing. (Apart from Sir Keir Starmer, who said Jeremy Corbyn would make “a great prime minister”, although he now claims he knew that would never happen so endorsing a Marxist mate of Hamas to lead the United Kingdom was no biggie.)Lots of readers were kind enough to say they cut my piece out of the Telegraph and stuck it on the fridge as a keepsake, a reminder of all that happiness and hope. No such jubilation will greet the installation of a Labour government on July 5. Rishi Sunak’s personal popularity rating may have sunk even further since the wretched D-Day debacle (“The Shortest Day” as one wag adapted the title on the film poster), but Sir Keir Starmer’s numbers are also deep into negative territory.

You’ll understand that, given the nature of the inquiry, it is necessarily independent and confidential.”13 Jun 2024-03:47PM GMTLabour will raise taxes to historic highs, warns Rishi SunakSpeaking at the G7 summit, Rishi Sunak said: “You’ve seen two manifestos this week and there’s a clear choice at this election.“We published a manifesto that’s going to cut taxes for people in this country and the Labour manifesto that was published today made it clear that taxes are going to rise.“Multiple independent sources demonstrate the tax burden under Labour demonstrate will rise to the highest levels in history. And in contrast, if I’m re-elected, we will cut taxes for people at every stage of their life, cutting taxes for people in work, cutting tax for people who are self-employed, cutting tax for people who are buying their first home, cutting tax for pensioners and cutting taxes for families.“That’s the type of country I want to build because I believe everyone should keep more of their hard-earned money. And the choice is crystal clear at this election. If you want your taxes cut, vote Conservative, and under Labour they’re going to rise to the highest levels we have seen in our nation’s history.”13 Jun 2024-03:44PM GMTSunak: G7’s Ukraine package will make an enormous differenceRishi Sunak said he had “a productive set of meetings, particularly on Ukraine” at the G7 leaders’ summit to discuss a “game-changing package of support” funded by the profits on seized Russian assets.“This is something that I and the UK have personally championed and led on for a while now so it’s very positive to see it close to the finish line.“It will make an enormous difference and demonstrates the UK is absolutely united in doing everything it can to support Ukraine to defend itself against Russian aggression.”13 Jun 2024-03:36PM GMTHow postal ballots triggered a Tory rush to warn of a Labour super-majorityBarely had the ink dried on the Conservative manifesto before Grant Shapps was out and about warning voters about the danger of a Labour super-majority, writesGordon Rayner, The Telegraph’s Associate Editor.Rather than telling voters how the manifesto pledges were going to make their lives better, the Defence Secretary appeared to be conceding that Labour had already won, and it was just a matter of how all-conquering their victory would be.Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor, doubled down on the new message, telling voters that if they backed Reform UK or the Lib Dems they would end up giving Labour “an even bigger majority”.It seemed a strange tactic to be pursuing after Rishi Sunak had insisted he had not given up on winning the general election on July 4.

The public is clamouring for change, but there will be no great rupture under Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour, no break with the dismal status quo, just a further acceleration in our national decline. We should be grateful for small mercies. Jeremy Corbyn would have imposed full-on socialism; many of his allies wanted to ban private schools altogether and savagely expropriate wealth. Starmer will misinterpret his likely super-majority as an endorsement of technocratic rule, giving him carte blanche to double-down on the neo-Blairite consensus that has been hegemonic in the UK since 1997, with an added dollop of class warfare, punitive taxation and wokery.The Tories, especially those who saw themselves as the heirs to Blair, have only themselves to blame for the fact that Nigel Farage is now polling almost as highly as them. There is no future for the Tory party unless it breaks with today’s pseudo-centrism  and invents a new mass market Thatcherism for the modern era.If that doesn’t happen, Britain will go the way of much of Europe, where the mainstream centre-Right and centre-Left stand utterly discredited for failing to fix any of their countries’ economic or cultural problems, and are being replaced by radical parties, some sensible (such as Giorgia Meloni’s in Italy) and some unpalatable (such as the AfD in Germany, which is rife with extremists).Chat with Allister in the comments section of his article 13 Jun 2024-02:34PM GMTEd Davey quips ‘the campaign is hotting up’The campaign is hotting up  pic.twitter.com/XIyvYn208m — Ed Davey (@EdwardJDavey) June 13, 2024 13 Jun 2024-02:31PM GMTMiriam Cates: Starmer is more dangerous than Blair ever wasPolitics can be a frustrating business, writesMiriam Cates.MPs and ministers have many sensible ideas about how to solve a whole range of challenges, whether that is how to reduce immigration, reform the NHS or boost economic growth.But, as I have witnessed first hand since I was elected in 2019, achieving meaningful change in any of these areas can be a painfully slow and difficult task.It’s true that the Conservative Party has had 14 years to repeal Blairite legislation. But fair-minded voters will acknowledge that such reforms would not have been politically possible in coalition, nor practically achievable alongside Brexit, nor a priority during the pandemic.However, the great irony is that because the Conservatives have been unable to roll back New Labour reforms, Starmer may now get the chance to pick up where Blair left off.Miriam Cates: There may soon be nothing left for Conservatives to conserve 13 Jun 2024-02:25PM GMTKeir Starmer announces £8.6bn worth of tax risesLabour has unveiled plans to hike taxes by £8.6 billion through raids on private schools, overseas property investors and non-doms, writesGenevieve Holl-Allen.The party’s manifesto says that its planned tax rises will raise a combined £8.6 billion by 2028-29, with the money used to pay for more NHS appointments and teachers.Despite Sir Keir Starmer repeatedly insisting all his policies would be fully costed, the manifesto only provides a breakdown of costs for the final year of a Labour government.It contains a summary of the revenues Labour would raise and the cost of delivering its pledges for 2028-29 but does not provide one for any other year.Read the full story here 13 Jun 2024-02:13PM GMTElection no obstacle to more Lib Dem stunts13 Jun 2024-02:07PM GMTStarmer: I’m ready to deliver changeChange.I'm ready to deliver it.You can vote for it on Thursday 4 July. pic.twitter.com/KNmVgLP7dI — Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) June 13, 2024 13 Jun 2024-02:01PM GMTLabour ‘is undermining its own credibility’The Labour manifesto should have done more to prepare voters for “difficult trade-offs”, the Institute for Government has said.Nick Davies, programme director at the think tank, said Sir Keir Starmer “acknowledges the scale of the challenges facing public services, but the party doesn’t yet have solutions that are equal to the task”.“Oppositions understandably only focus on detailed policy development once they are in government, but the manifesto should have done more to prepare the public for difficult trade-offs that will be required,” Mr Davies said.Dr Gemma Tetlow, the chief economist at the IfG, added: “Like the Conservatives, Labour has done little to row back on the spending cuts already pencilled in for the next parliament.“This, coupled with its pledge not to raise any of the main taxes, undermines the credibility of its promise to address failing public services.”13 Jun 2024-01:47PM GMTCraig Williams: I’ve made a huge error of judgmentCraig Williams has declined to say whether he had any inside information when he bet £100 on a July election  three days before Rishi Sunak called a snap poll.Asked if he knew Rishi Sunak would go to the country, Mr Williams, the Prime Minister’s parliamentary private secretary, told BBC News: “I’ve made a statement, it’s an independent process with the Gambling Commission now.

So I think that creates a big set of expectations and that is the consequence of the manifesto strategy. This manifesto makes the first year in government for Labour very difficult.”13 Jun 2024-01:28PM GMTGood afternoonDominic Penna here, The Telegraph’s Political Correspondent, guiding you through the rest of the day.13 Jun 2024-01:22PM GMTPictured: Rachel Reeves sheds a tear during Labour’s manifesto launch13 Jun 2024-01:15PM GMTLabour promises economic growth ‘will happen’ under its plansEconomic growth “will happen” under a Labour government, a party spokesperson has insisted. When asked whether growth could be “guaranteed”, the spokesperson said: “This growth will happen, and if you read the 4,500 words that are dedicated to growth within the manifesto, you will see the clear commitments that we have got there, from whether it’s you know the three pillars that we have of our growth plan – of stability, of investment, and in reform – so therefore if you look at what we want to do around stabilising the economy, where we want to invest, where we want to have the reforms, whether it’s on planning reform, on labour market reform, on ensuring that we can sort of knock down those barriers to growth that we’ve seen previously, we are absolutely confident [the country] can have higher levels of growth than we have seen under the Conservatives.”13 Jun 2024-01:04PM GMTLabour economic approach ‘sets the scene’ for tax hikes and spending cuts, says think tankLabour’s cautious approach to tax and spend mean it could be left implementing sharp tax rises and public service cuts over the next parliament if elected, the Resolution Foundation has warned.The party’s plans to raise taxes by £8.5 billion-a-year, coupled with the £23.5 billion post-election tax hikes already announced by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, would leave households facing a £1,100-a-year tax rise, according to the think tank.It said that Labour’s pledges to increase spending largely affect education and health and social care, while a Labour government would still need to deliver around £18 billion of cuts to unprotected departments such as Transport, Justice and the Home Office.Mike Brewer, the Resolution Foundation’s interim chief executive, said Labour’s cautious approach to the public finances “sets the scene for a parliament of tax rises and spending cuts for unprotected departments”.“Even then, a modest dose of bad economic news could force a fresh round of tough fiscal choices if the debt rule is to be met,” he said. 13 Jun 2024-12:56PM GMTLabour wants tax burden ‘for working people’ to fallA Labour spokesperson said the party wanted the tax burden “for working people” to fall.When asked by journalists to “admit that the tax burden will be higher” under a future Labour government, the spokesperson said: “What the costings set out is the ways in which this is a fully-funded, fully-costed manifesto.“We have said that we are not putting taxes up on working people – there will be no increase in VAT, in income tax, in national insurance. We’ve also said that we won’t be increasing corporation tax.”They added: “In the revenue that we are raising, there’s obviously the measures that we’ve announced and I’ve seen some of the figures that the Tories are putting around – within that they are including the money that we are getting in from tax avoidance, from the money from non-doms from the other measures that we’ve already announced in terms of raising revenue.”The spokesperson also said: “Fundamentally, what we want to do is ensure that we are growing the economy and that will mean that we, you know, have the ability to ensure we’ve got more money in the economy through the growth policies that we have.“But what we want to make sure is that for working people – we don’t want to see the tax burden on working people going up, we want to see the tax burden coming down on working people. That’s what Keir and Rachel have said throughout this campaign, throughout the process, and that remains their position.”13 Jun 2024-12:47PM GMTSenior Tory: Labour manifesto only contained tax rises, no tax cutsLaura Trott said Labour’s manifesto “only contained tax rises, no tax cuts” as she repeated the disputed Tory claim that the rival party’s policies would cost every family £2,000.The Chief Secretary to the Treasury told broadcasters: “What we saw this morning was Labour’s Tax Trap Manifesto. It only contained tax rises, no tax cuts whatsoever.“Under their own published plans the tax burden in this country will rise to levels never seen before, and that’s not including the £2,000 of tax they want to levy on every working family across the country.”13 Jun 2024-12:37PM GMTIFS: No indication Labour has plan to pay for promised ‘change’The Institute for Fiscal Studies said Labour’s manifesto had provided “no indication that there is a plan for where the money would come” to deliver the change the party is promising.Paul Johnson, the director of the think tank, said: “This is a manifesto that promises a dizzying number of reviews and strategies to tackle some of the challenges facing the country. “That is better than a shopping list of half-baked policy announcements. But delivering genuine change will almost certainly also require putting actual resources on the table. “And Labour’s manifesto offers no indication that there is a plan for where the money would come from to finance this.”13 Jun 2024-12:28PM GMTManifesto protester: Labour only offering ‘warm words’ on climate changeThe protester who disrupted Sir Keir Starmer’s manifesto launch said all Labour is offering on tackling climate change is “warm words and tinkering around the edges”.The Green New Deal Rising campaign group named the activist as 27-year-old Alice, who said in a statement: “I disrupted the Labour Party’s manifesto launch today because I feel so betrayed and disappointed by what the Labour Party is offering at this election…“The next parliament really is our last chance to put in place the kind of policies that will make a real difference to stopping catastrophic climate change and making people’s quality of life better. But all Labour is offering is warm words and tinkering around the edges.”13 Jun 2024-12:22PM GMTThink tank: Labour manifesto has ‘little detail’ and ‘no fireworks’The Social Market Foundation think tank labelled Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour blueprint a “Ming Vase manifesto”. Theo Bertram, the director of the SMF, said there was “little detail” and “no fireworks” in the document. He said: “The Ming Vase manifesto: change but with caution; great determination, little detail. “There are no fireworks, no surprises, no great adventure but plenty of policies that Labour has already announced. “It’s not fair to say it is without ambition or new ideas but it is light on detail. If the polls are right, Labour will enter Downing St on July 5 with a huge majority in favour of a clear mandate for change that is significantly undefined.”13 Jun 2024-12:16PM GMTLabour accused of ‘divisive attack’ on countryside after pledge to ban trail huntingThe Countryside Alliance accused Labour of an “unjustified and divisive attack” on rural communities after the party pledged in its manifesto to ban trail hunting. Tim Bonner, chief executive of the organisation, said: “ Labour can’t ban trail hunting and then claim that it respects the countryside.“Trail hunting is exactly what they told hunts to do 20 years ago and now they are saying that they want to ban that, too. This is an unjustified and divisive attack on the rural community and one which is out of step with the public’s priorities for the countryside.“If Labour was truly interested in animal welfare and the effectiveness of the law it would have committed to review the Hunting Act. Instead it is pledging further pointless legislation that will waste hours of parliamentary time and criminalise people for a totally benign activity. It’s not ‘change’ to use the countryside as a political football again”.Labour claims trail hunting is being used as a “smokescreen” for illegal fox hunting. Fox hunting was banned in England and Wales under the last Labour government in 2005, but trail hunting, in which hounds follow a scented cloth, remained legal.13 Jun 2024-12:09PM GMT‘Totally unserious’ Labour manifesto only contains costings for a single yearLabour has been criticised for setting out just one year’s worth of costs for its policies-despite Sir Keir Starmer repeatedly insisting all his plans would be “fully costed”.The party’s manifesto  only provides a breakdown of the revenues it would raise and the amount of money it would spend for 2028-29-set to be the last year of its first term.Conservative officials said the lack of detailed figures for the first four years of Labour’s time in power  showed that its plan for the country was “totally unserious”.You can read the full story here.  13 Jun 2024-11:56AM GMTSunak: Labour manifesto would mean ‘highest taxes in history’Rishi Sunak said Labour’s manifesto would result in the “highest taxes in history”.

John O’Connell, chief executive of the campaign group, said: “Taxpayers hoping for change from an ever-rising tax burden will be bitterly disappointed by a Labour manifesto that may rule out major tax rises, but leaves the door open to alternative ways of tapping up workers, families and businesses.“With substantial spending commitments to pay for, a Keir Starmer government will inevitably be looking to find ways to dip deeper and deeper into the pockets of Brits, effectively guaranteeing years of further stagnation.“No hikes to income tax, National Insurance, and VAT is good news but, as the current government has shown, there are plenty of other ways to raid household budgets.”13 Jun 2024-11:51AM GMTGMB union: Labour manifesto ‘offers vision of hope’The GMB union said the Labour manifesto “offers a vision of hope for the UK”.

Responding to the Labour manifesto launch, the Tory chancellor said: “This is Labour’s Tax Trap Manifesto which contains only tax rises and no tax cuts. Under Labour’s published plans, taxes will rise to levels never before seen in this country. “But that’s only the tax rises they’re telling you about – it doesn’t include the £2,094 of tax rises they’ll need to fill their £38.5 billion unfunded spending commitments.  “So what’s most important is not what’s in Labour’s manifesto, but it’s what they have kept out of it. They are refusing to rule out taxing your job, your home, your pension, your car, your business and they think they can get away with it without anyone holding them to account. Be under no illusion, from cradle to grave you will pay more taxes under Labour.”                      13 Jun 2024-11:22AM GMT                                         Starmer: Wife Victoria ‘thinks I should have stayed’ as a lawyer                    Sir Keir Starmer revealed his wife, Victoria, would have preferred him to stay in his career as a lawyer.  Asked what he would do in his first week as PM if he wins the election, Sir Keir said: “The first thing I would do is return politics to service, tpo service, to serve this country. I came into politics to serve. “I had a career in the law before this. My wife rather thinks I should have stayed with it. But I changed because I wanted to serve my country.”                       13 Jun 2024-11:17AM GMT                                         Labour manifesto only includes tax rises previously set out, says Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer was told that the Labour manifesto made clear that the party is fighting the election on a platform of tax rises.  He said that the manifesto only included tax rises that the party had already set out.  He said: “What you won’t see in this manifesto is any plan that requires tax rises over and above those that we have already set out because we have been very, very clear particularly in relation to working people, no increase in income tax, no increase in National Insurance, and no increase in VAT.  “Absolutely clearly set out in this manifesto.”                       13 Jun 2024-11:14AM GMT                                         Starmer rejects ‘defeatist approach’ on tax and spend                    Sir Keir Starmer was asked what he would do if his plan to boost economic growth falls flat.  He was asked which option he would choose-borrowing more, cutting spending or putting up taxes-if his sums do not add up.  The Labour leader refused to engage with the premise of the question as he said: “This manifesto is a total rejection of that defeatist approach that the only levers are tax and spend.”                       13 Jun 2024-11:10AM GMT                                         Labour leader won’t be drawn on specifics of pledge to cut net migration                    The Labour manifesto pledges to reduce net migration-but it is not specific about any target.  Sir Keir Starmer was asked what the pledge actually means but he would not be drawn as he answered questions in Manchester.  He said that “we do need to have lower immigration” and claimed that the Tories had “lost control” of the nation’s borders. But he did not refer to a target or a more specific aim.                       13 Jun 2024-11:06AM GMT                                         Starmer ‘enjoying’ general election campaign                    Sir Keir Starmer said he was enjoying the general election campaign.

Asked how he would avoid making cuts to services and a return to austerity, he said: “We are not going to return to austerity.  “I ran a public service for five years, the Crown Prosecution Service, I lived through austerity, I am never going to allow a Labour government to do that to our public services. Never.”                       13 Jun 2024-10:58AM GMT                                         Starmer rejects ‘Captain Caution’ label after unveiling manifesto                    Sir Keir Starmer denied that the Labour manifesto showed he was “Captain Caution”. He was told that the manifesto contained “not a single new policy” that had not already been announced and it appeared to be a “Captain Caution manifesto designed to protect your poll lead”.  But the Labour leader replied: “No. It is a serious plan for the future of our country and every single policy in this document, policy after policy after policy, has been carefully thought through and tested to ensure that we can deliver it.”  He added: “I am running as a candidate to be prime minister, not a candidate to run the circus.”                       13 Jun 2024-10:53AM GMT                                         Starmer urges nation to back Labour to ‘rebuild our country’                    Sir Keir Starmer suggested that many parents across the country do not currently believe that the “future will be better for their children”.  But the Labour leader insisted a government led by him “can build” that future.  Concluding his speech in Manchester, Sir Keir said: “That is our plan and I invite you all to join our mission, to stop the chaos, turn the page and start to rebuild our country.”  Sir Keir was given another standing ovation after he finished.

That would be their fifth year in office if they win, writes Ben Riley-Smith.  The party justifies the approach by saying in the foreword before the costings pages that the final year will see costs at their highest.  The manifesto says: “We have used the last year of the most recent Office for Budget Responsibility forecast (2028-29) which represents the highest annual cost of the policies.” But it is a different approach to the Tories, who on Tuesday produced a manifesto with costings figures for each of the next five five years.  A Tory source says: “Labour have have not laid out tax and spending plans for the next five years, only showing one year, and that’s in four years time. Says nothing about the next three years. This is totally unserious.”                      13 Jun 2024-10:45AM GMT                                         Labour is the ‘party of wealth creation’, says Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer said that if he can deliver economic growth at “anything like the rate of the last Labour government” there will be tens of billions of pounds of extra money to invest in public services.  He said Labour has a “plan for growth, we are pro-business and pro-worker, the party of wealth creation”.                       13 Jun 2024-10:43AM GMT                                         Starmer takes swipe at Farage                    Sir Keir Starmer suggested there would be no rabbits or unexpected surprises in the Labour manifesto.  The Labour leader took a swipe at Nigel Farage, telling activists in Manchester: “If you want politics as pantomime I hear Clacton is nice this time of year.”                       13 Jun 2024-10:40AM GMT                                         Starmer vows no increase to income tax, NI and VAT                    Sir Keir Starmer said that all of Labour’s policy plans have been fully costed and the party knows how it will pay for them.  He said that was “non-negotiable” because “you cannot play fast and loose with the public finances”.  The Labour leader then pledged no increases to income tax, National Insurance and VAT.  “That is a manifesto commitment,” he said.                       13 Jun 2024-10:37AM GMT                                         Labour offering voters a ‘total change of direction’                    Sir Keir Starmer argued that “Britain has lost its balance” and “opportunity is not spread evenly enough” across the country. He said a Labour government would seek to boost prosperity across the board and “turn the page” on some communities being left behind “forever”.

But Sir Keir Starmer said the party’s manifesto represented a “credible, long term plan” to improve things.

The Labour leader said many people cannot afford a mortgage to achieve their dream of home ownership. He then referred to a visit to a children’s hospital where he was told that the commonest cause for admissions for young children was tooth decay.  He set out an alternate reality of more affordable homes and better healthcare with a “Labour government on their side”.                       13 Jun 2024-10:30AM GMT                                         Protester attempts to disrupt Starmer speech                    A protester attempted to disrupt Sir Keir Starmer’s speech in Manchester.

The Labour Party continues to ride high in the opinion polls, consistently 20 or so points ahead of the Tories.  But with his manifesto launch, starting at 11am, he is approaching a moment of maximum danger.  A smooth launch will leave Labour in pole position ahead of July 4 and leave the Tories staring down the barrel.  But Labour figures will know that anything can happen in politics and should a major policy unravel or if Sir Keir should suffer an unexpected slip up, things could move from smooth sailing to stormy seas in a flash.                       13 Jun 2024-09:46AM GMT                                         Pictured: Swinney launches SNP billboard campaign in Edinburgh                                         13 Jun 2024-09:41AM GMT                                         Labour candidate going viral with ‘21 Seconds’ election song                    A Labour candidate is in the process of going viral on social media after tweeting a video of her singing a 2024 general election version of an early-2000s UK garage hit.

Asked what he will do if the Conservatives lose the election, the Foreign Secretary told Sky News: “If my mother had wheels she’d be a bicycle, I don’t answer questions beginning with the word if.”                      13 Jun 2024-09:12AM GMT                                         Sunak aide who bet on July election ‘very foolish’, says Lord Cameron                    Lord Cameron said Rishi Sunak’s parliamentary private secretary made a “clearly very foolish decision” when he placed a £100 bet on a July election three days before it was announced. Craig Williams, who is seeking re-election in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, has confirmed he is under investigation by the gambling watchdog after he “put a flutter” on a July poll. Asked what situation Mr Williams was now in, the Foreign Secretary told BBC Breakfast: “His situation, having made this clearly very foolish decision, is that he is being investigated by the Gambling Commission and they have considerable powers in terms of what the consequences could be. “I think we have to let that investigation take place and so I can’t really comment any further on it.”                      13 Jun 2024-08:58AM GMT                                         Farage: ‘Penny is beginning to drop’ on impact of mass migration                    Nigel Farage said the “penny is beginning to drop” on the impact of mass migration on the UK.  The Reform UK leader also took aim at the Tories and Labour and said neither party could be trusted to bring net migration down.  He told LBC: “If you’ve got net migration running at three quarters of a million a year, it’s not surprising the size of the economy grows.  “But the income per head has fallen for the last six consecutive quarters. The penny is beginning to drop. Mass migration is making us poorer. Mass migration means our kids and grandkids can’t get houses.  “Mass migration means rents are up between 20 and 30 per cent in the last three years alone in this country.”  He added: “This is now the fifth manifesto in a row from the Conservatives that has promised they will reduce net migration. No one believes them. And Labour have almost nothing to say.” The penny is finally beginning to drop on mass migration. The Conservatives and Labour have failed us all. pic.twitter.com/icX9vt0gxA                      13 Jun 2024-08:42AM GMT                                         Sunak ‘totally in command’ during TV clash, says Lord Cameron                    Rishi Sunak was “totally in command” during last night’s The Battle For No 10 programme, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said. Speaking to Sky News, the former prime minister said: “You see it in Cabinet, he is absolutely at the top of his game.” He added: “I saw someone who was totally in command of the detail, of the brief.” Lord Cameron said Mr Sunak is “always the best briefed person in the room” during Cabinet meetings.                      13 Jun 2024-08:29AM GMT                                         Time to move on from D-Day row, says Foreign Secretary                    Lord Cameron has defended Rishi Sunak’s decision to leave D-Day events early and said it is time to move on. The former prime minister told ITV’s Good Morning Britain programme: “Prime ministers have to make lots of difficult decisions about when to go to things, and when to leave things, and who to see and all the rest of it. “And to be fair to Rishi, he went to the key event in Portsmouth with all of the D-Day veterans in the UK, and then he went to the key event above the British Normandy beaches, that was again a beautiful event and he met lots of veterans there. “Then he left to go back to the UK and then immediately said he had made a mistake and he had wished he had stayed, and I think we should leave it there. Because that’s the sort of guy he is, he made a mistake, instead of digging in and defending it, he said: ‘actually, no, no, I got that one wrong I should’ve stayed’.” Lord Cameron said it was “time to move on to the substance” and pointed to the Government’s track record of supporting veterans.                      13 Jun 2024-08:12AM GMT                                         Starmer says he sees private dentist after insisting he ‘doesn’t use private health’                    Sir Keir Starmer has said that he uses a private dentist, despite previously insisting he would not use any private healthcare. The Labour leader said during an election debate on Sky News on Wednesday night that he uses a private dentist because he is not eligible for NHS care. His comment came after he used a previous TV debate to say that he would not use private healthcare even if a relative were stuck on an NHS waiting list.                      You can read the full story                      here                      .                                          13 Jun 2024-07:59AM GMT                                         Labour expected to play safe and steer clear of manifesto surprises                    My colleague Ben Riley-Smith is on his way to Manchester to attend the Labour manifesto launch. He sent across the following update:  Hello from the 7.33am train from London to Manchester which is zooming towards the location of Labour’s election manifesto launch.  The political watchword for the document is expected to be “reassurance”-an attempt to sooth Middle England and make clear Sir Keir Starmer’s “changed Labour Party” can be trusted with the country’s purse and defence.  The manifesto is understood to be around 23,000 words long, which is shorter than Jeremy Corbyn’s pitch in the 2019 general election. That makes it some 125 pages long.  We are also told there are no fewer than 34 photographs of Sir Keir inside the booklet, so the Labour leader is being put front and centre of the party’s re-election pitch.  Will there be surprises? The message from Labour HQ is no, and certainly not on tax changes. The vast majority of what is contained in the manifesto is expected to be already known.  The political situation explains why. When you are 20-plus percentage points ahead in an election campaign which ends in three weeks, the last thing you want to do is upset the apple cart.                      13 Jun 2024-07:53AM GMT                                         Labour frontbencher won’t be drawn on whether manifesto will have tax cuts                    Pat McFadden refused to be drawn on whether there will be any specific tax cuts included in the Labour manifesto.  Labour’s national campaign coordinator told the BBC: “Tax cuts have to be sustainable and affordable. That’s a lesson we should have learned two years ago when Liz Truss crashed the economy.  “Rishi Sunak was supposed to be the antidote to Liz Truss. He’s turned out to be the latest instalment of the same fantasy economics that leads to chaos.  “And where that ends up is you don’t get the tax cuts, but you do get the mortgage rises. And that is exactly the recipe that they are offering. We are not going to make that mistake.”                       13 Jun 2024-07:46AM GMT                                         Starmer called out by Andrew Neil over claim he did not have Sky TV growing up                    Andrew Neil has called out Sir Keir Starmer for claiming his family did not have Sky TV when he was a child – because the service launched when he was 27 years old. The Labour leader said he “certainly” did not have the paid-for channel after Rishi Sunak said it was one of the things he had to go without growing up. Neil, a broadcaster who was the founding chairman of Sky TV, criticised Sir Keir, 61, for the remarks, saying: “I launched Sky TV in 1989, by which time Starmer was 27 – so obviously he didn’t have Sky growing up. Nobody his age did since it didn’t exist.”                      You can read the full story                      here                      .                                          13 Jun 2024-07:43AM GMT                                         Pat McFadden fails to rule out making changes to council tax bands                    Pat McFadden failed to rule out a Labour government making changes to council tax in the future as the party prepares to unveil its manifesto later this morning.  Labour’s national campaign coordinator was asked repeatedly during an interview on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme if the party could opt to recalculate council tax bands.  He said: “There is nothing in the manifesto that we publish today that requires any change in tax rates beyond what we have already announced.”  Asked again on whether Labour could recalculate council tax bands, Mr McFadden said: “There is nothing in our plans that requires a change in that or other taxes.”                       13 Jun 2024-07:21AM GMT                                         Farage: I would be happy to lead merged Reform-Tory party                    Nigel Farage said he would be willing to lead a merged Reform-Conservative party.  The Reform leader said he could not lead the Tory party as it “currently is” but predicted a new party is likely to emerge after the general election.  Asked if he could rule out one day leading the Conservative Party, Mr Farage told LBC this morning: “I think something new is going to emerge on the centre right, I don’t know what it is called.  “But do I think I am capable of leading a national opposition to a Labour Party with a big majority where I can stand up and hold them to account on issues? Yes.”  Asked if he would be happy to lead a merged party, he replied: “Yes.”  He added: “They [the Tories] may be dead. They may well be dead. This may well be the end of their journey. I would be prepared to lead the centre right in this country.”                      13 Jun 2024-07:19AM GMT                                         Farage: Reform ‘close to a tipping point’ of overtaking Tories                    Nigel Farage said he believed Reform UK is “very close to a tipping point” when it will overtake the Conservative Party in the opinion polls.  A recent YouGov poll put the Tories just one point ahead of Reform.  Mr Farage claimed the “election is over, Labour has won” and the question now is about who will lead the opposition in the House of Commons to Sir Keir Starmer.  The Reform leader told LBC he believed the “Conservatives will be incapable” of providing that opposition because they “hate each other” and he would be best placed to take on Labour.                       13 Jun 2024-07:11AM GMT                                         Foreign Secretary: ‘I don’t feel sorry for him’                    Lord Cameron said he does not “feel sorry” for Rishi Sunak. The former prime minister told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “What I feel about Rishi Sunak is that he’s a very capable Prime Minister. “I don’t feel sorry for him because he’s a very effective Prime Minister who wants to go on doing his job.” Lord Cameron also admitted the polls don’t “look good” for the Conservatives, but added “they didn’t look very good in 2015 when I won the election”.                      13 Jun 2024-07:04AM GMT                                         Lord Cameron blames high levels of immigration on lack of welfare reform                    High levels of immigration are due to a lack of welfare reform, Lord Cameron suggested.  The Foreign Secretary told Times Radio: “The biggest thing that we need to get right, and the biggest cause of this increase in migration, is the fact that so many people decided to leave the workforce after Covid, we haven’t been effectively reforming welfare. “Because ultimately we all want British businesses to be more productive, but ultimately if you lose a million workers from the workforce, they’re going to have to come from somewhere and that’s why I think we have seen such high levels of migration. “Now in this election, as far as I can see, the Conservative Party has got a plan for reforming welfare, with back to work tests and all the rest of it, and Labour have got no plan for reforming welfare.”                      13 Jun 2024-07:01AM GMT                                         Tories focused on winning over Reform voters, says Lord Cameron                    The Conservative Party is focused on trying to win over Reform voters, not insult them, Lord Cameron said.  The Foreign Secretary told Times Radio: “All the things Reform voters want, and I don’t want to insult them in any way, I want to win them over, because I think like me they want to see strong defences in an uncertain world, they want to see a secure border in a dangerous world, they want to see lower taxes in a world where families are struggling and need that extra help.  “The things they want are things only a Conservative government can deliver and by voting Reform you make them less likely, not more likely.”  Lord Cameron was asked if his heart had sunk when Nigel Farage announced his return.  The Tory peer said: “I don’t think my heart did anything particularly. I am very focused on winning for the blue team.”                      13 Jun 2024-06:53AM GMT                                         Lord Cameron won’t say if he warned Sunak over D-Day decision                    Lord Cameron refused to say whether he had warned Rishi Sunak against leaving D-Day commemorations in Normandy early.  The Foreign Secretary stood in for the Prime Minister during a gathering of world leaders after the latter chose to return to the UK to do a general election interview last Thursday. Asked if he had told Mr Sunak that he was making a mistake, Lord Cameron told Times Radio: “I am not going to get into my advice or my department’s advice to the Prime Minister. We are part of a team.”                       13 Jun 2024-06:34AM GMT                                         Lord Cameron declares ‘anything is possible’ and Tories can still win election                    Lord Cameron insisted the Conservative Party can still win the general election on July 4 as he declared: “Anything is possible.”  The Foreign Secretary said the 2015 contest when he led the Tories to an unexpected majority victory showed that anything can happen.  He told Times Radio: “I remember fighting the election in 2015 and people said I didn’t have a chance and we were behind in the polls and we kept going and we had a clear plan, we had a strong team, and we came through and won the election.  “So anything is possible. I always think during elections, time spent talking about opinion polls is just time completely wasted because you don’t know whether they are right, I don’t know whether they are right and we will find out in 21 days.”  He added: “I believe anything can happen.”                      13 Jun 2024-06:24AM GMT                                         Streeting refuses to rule out increase in capital gains tax                    Wes Streeting refused to rule out a capital gains tax increase if Labour win power.  Asked if he could rule out a rise, the shadow health secretary told Times Radio: “It is true to say when people see our manifesto they will see that there is nothing in there that requires us to raise any of those taxes.  “We are being really careful about the promises we make because the bar for getting into the manifesto has been a bar of is this something we can 100 per cent deliver and is this something we are sure the country can afford.  “So we have been careful on that.”                       13 Jun 2024-06:21AM GMT                                         Streeting accuses Tories of ‘cynical voter suppression tactic’ over ‘super majority’ warning                    Wes Streeting accused the Tories of deploying a “cynical voter suppression tactic” after Grant Shapps warned against handing Labour a “super majority” on July 4.  Asked if he believed Labour will secure a “super majority” victory, the shadow health secretary told Times Radio: “Grant Shapps isn’t remotely worried about a super majority. Grant Shapps is looking at the same opinion polls I am but he is also, no doubt, knocking on doors as well and finding the same thing as me which is there are millions of undecided voters in this country.  “Not a single vote has been cast. The only way people will get change is if they vote for it on July 4.  “I think what he did yesterday was a cynical voter suppression tactic to say to people who want the Tories out ‘oh, you don’t actually need to bother to do that because everyone else is doing that, you can either stay at home or vote for one of the smaller parties without consequence or keep your nice, friendly Conservative MP’.”                      13 Jun 2024-06:13AM GMT                                         Starmer was trying to influence Labour ‘from within’ under Corbyn leadership, says Streeting                    Sir Keir Starmer served in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet and campaigned for him to be prime minister in 2019 because he was trying to influence Labour “from within”, Wes Streeting said.  Sir Keir has faced scrutiny during the current election campaign over his past backing for Mr Corbyn and he has attempted to distance himself from his time under the former Labour leader.  Mr Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said Sir Keir and others had worked under Mr Corbyn as they tried to figure out “how best to try and salvage the Labour Party”.  He said Sir Keir had wanted to “influence from within as best as possible to stop the Labour Party going completely off a cliff”.                      13 Jun 2024-06:00AM GMT                                         Starmer not in the ‘entertainment business’, says Labour frontbencher                    Sir Keir Starmer is not in the “entertainment business”, a senior Labour figure said this morning as he countered claims that the party’s leader lacked charisma.  It was suggested to Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign coordinator, that Sir Keir was “Blair without the flair”.  He replied: “A sober, serious leader is exactly what the country needs right now. I don’t think he is trying to be in the entertainment business.  “He is trying to be a sober, serious leader and that is what he will be if he is elected on July 4.”                      13 Jun 2024-05:56AM GMT                                         Economic growth plan the ‘missing piece’ in election debate so far, says McFadden                    Pat McFadden said Labour’s manifesto will be a “plan to change the country” and it will be “responsible” and “costed”.  Labour’s national campaign coordinator said a plan for economic growth had been the “missing piece in this election debate so far”.  It will be “at the heart of the manifesto we are publishing this morning”, he told GB News this morning.                       13 Jun 2024-05:52AM GMT                                         Coming up: Wes Streeting and Lord Cameron on the morning broadcast round                    Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, will represent the Conservative Party on the morning media round today.  Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, will be banging the drum for Labour ahead of its manifesto launch.  Meanwhile, Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, is scheduled to be taking part in a phone-in on LBC at 8am.                       13 Jun 2024-05:46AM GMT                                         What is happening in the general election campaign today?

The Labour leader has promised voters there will be “no tax surprises” in the document, with the party expected to pledge no increases in income tax, National Insurance, VAT and corporation tax. However, it is not expected to rule out future rises in other levies like capital gains tax and the Tories will be ready to pounce on any ambiguity. Rishi Sunak is taking a break from campaigning as he attends a G7 summit in Puglia, Italy, where he is set to announce new funding for war-torn Ukraine. Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, will be campaigning in Kent while Plaid Cymru will launch its manifesto in Cardiff. ITV will then host a seven-way debate this evening from 8.30pm, featuring representatives from the seven main parties. The representatives will be Penny Mordaunt for the Conservatives, Angela Rayner for Labour, Daisy Cooper for the Lib Dems, Stephen Flynn for the SNP, Nigel Farage for Reform UK, Carla Denyer for the Green Party and Rhun ap Iorwerth for Plaid Cymru.                      13 Jun 2024-05:40AM GMT                                         Starmer leaves door open to host of tax rises                    Labour’s election manifesto will not rule out increases in council tax, fuel duty and capital gains tax, Sir Keir Starmer admitted last night. The Labour leader repeatedly declined to rule out tax rises if he became prime minister after the general election, during a Sky News election programme. During the interview with Beth Rigby, Sir Keir was repeatedly asked to explicitly promise that there would be “no tax rises” if he won the general election on July 4. The Labour leader declined to do so. Instead, he promised “no tax rises for working people”, leaving open the possibility of increasing taxes on wealth.

Richard Holden, the chairman of the Conservative Party, claimed Labour is “refusing to say what they would really do because they know it would lose them votes”.  He repeated a disputed Tory claim that Labour would have to put up taxes by more than £2,000 to pay for its policies and said: “Labour aren’t being honest with the public; they are refusing to say what they would really do because they know it would lose them votes. “Labour will tax your family home, tax your pension, tax your job and tax your car and drag pensioners into the retirement tax.  “Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner are asking for a blank cheque and it’s becoming clear what he wants to do with it-put up your taxes.” Load-Date: June 13, 2024  End of Document
