   Brexit used as tool for personal gain Birmingham Evening Mail January 11, 2024 Thursday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Midland Independent Newspapers plc All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 17 Length: 271 words Body   A RECENT poll by Opinium shows that British voters now overwhelmingly feel that Brexit has failed to deliver on the promises made by the leave campaign in 2016, including controlling immigration, funding the NHS and boosting the economy. There's no chance of Britain re-joining the EU in the foreseeable future, but it's worth thinking how Tory governments got us into this situation. "Dodgy Dave" Cameron believed he could solve the Tories' internal war over the EU by holding a referendum, arrogantly unaware that angry voters might use the referendum to deliver a judgement on his brutal austerity rather than EU membership. Boris Johnson didn't actually want to leave the EU, but cynically saw support for the leave campaign as a way to advance his personal ambitions. What about Rishi Sunak? Prior to the referendum he stated "I believe that our nation will be more prosperous outside the EU. Outside the EU, we can decide our own immigration policy... and enhance our position as a dynamic, outwardlooking trading economy". Whatever else he is, it's neither stupid nor lazy. I'm certain he'd got his head round the detail of the EU and, despite his public words, knew Brexit couldn't deliver on what was being promised to voters. As a super-rich banker, he saw Brexit as an opportunity for money men to make hay and also avoid new EU rules on tax havens, with little or no thought to the consequences for ordinary folk. We're all victims of this shameful two faced behaviour for personal advancement or enrichment. Brexit may be here to stay, but this year we'll have the chance to oust these shysters.
