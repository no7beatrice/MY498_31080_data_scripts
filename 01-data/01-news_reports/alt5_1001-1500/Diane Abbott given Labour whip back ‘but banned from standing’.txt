   Diane Abbott given Labour whip back ‘but banned from standing’ telegraph.co.uk May 28, 2024 Tuesday 10:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:2 Length: 16228 words Byline: By Camilla Turner, Sunday Political Editor and Dominic Penna, Political Correspondent and Genevieve Holl-Allen, Political Reporter and Ben Riley-Smith, Political Editor Body   Diane Abbott will not be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate at the general election , according to reports. The MP for Hackney North & Stoke Newington, who served in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, was suspended from the party in April last year after she suggested that Jewish people did not experience racism “all their lives”.  Her comments came against a backdrop of historical claims of anti-Semitism in the party – a problem Sir Keir Starmer has been keen to stamp out since he took over as leader. Despite her allegedly not being able to stand again, it is understood that Ms Abbott was given back the Labour whip on Tuesday with Labour sources telling The Telegraph that senior figures in the party were trying to reach a “soft landing” for the MP whereby she can “go with grace”. The party leadership has decided that there are no circumstances in which she will stand for Labour on July 4, according to The Times. Those close to Sir Keir are hoping to reach a deal with Ms Abbott, whereby in exchange for having the whip restored she agrees not to stand as an MP, according to the source. Follow The Telegraph’s general election live blog “They don’t think it is appropriate for her to stand again but they are trying to reach out to her and get a soft landing – an agreement that she will retire in exchange for symbolically getting the whip back,” they said. “They are keen to reach an amicable agreement that reflects her unique status as an iconic figure for a lot of ethnic minority people.” Some Labour MPs have been pushing for Ms Abbott, who is the first black female MP, to be given a seat in the Lords. Kim Johnson, a Labour MP on the Left of the party, urged Sir Keir to allow Ms Abbott to stand as the party’s candidate in the election. She wrote on Twitter: Solidarity with Diane, undeniably a trailblazer & a hero of our movement.At a time when all our energy should be focussed on throwing the Tories out, this process looks nakedly factional.Diane should have the whip restored now so she can stand as Labour's candidate in the GE. Earlier on Tuesday, Sir Keir was accused of lying after it emerged that the investigation into Ms Abbott  was completed last year. When asked whether Ms Abbott would be readmitted into the party , he has repeatedly insisted that the matter is being dealt with by an independent process that has nothing to do with him. On Tuesday, BBC Newsnight reported that Labour’s national executive committee had completed its investigation into Ms Abbott  in December and she subsequently took a two-hour online anti-Semitism awareness training course. The matter was subsequently said to have been passed to Sir Alan Campbell, the Labour chief whip, but Ms Abbott has not heard from Sir Alan since they held a meeting earlier this year. Asked about the row on Tuesday morning, Jonathan Reynolds, a Labour frontbencher, refused to say whether Ms Abbott would be one of the party’s candidates  at the general election. Mr Reynolds  said he wanted the case “resolved as soon as possible” but declined to say whether she should be allowed to stand on a Labour ticket.  The Labour Party has set an internal deadline of June 4 to select all its candidates around the country, meaning it now has a week to decide whether to readmit Ms Abbott and allow her to run as the Labour candidate for her constituency. She could otherwise stand as an independent candidate. Jess Barnard, who sits on Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee, told The Telegraph that Sir Keir has been “untruthful” to suggest the process is independent, given that the “independent” NEC investigation concluded five months ago. She told The Telegraph: “It is clear for everyone to see that they are running the clock down to the general election  and they are using the NEC as a cover to run an alternative candidate. Although we see Keir Starmer claim that this is an independent process, we all know that it’s not. “If the conclusion of a case is that Diane Abbott should have been readmitted, those are instructions that the whip and Keir Starmer should have followed. Their decision not to conclude that case is political interference. It is very clear for everyone to see that it is Keir Starmer who is calling the shots.” Sir Keir, along with members of his shadow cabinet, has maintained that there is an ongoing independent process into Ms Abbott. In March, he said her suspension from the parliamentary Labour Party was subject to an independent process that was separate from him.  A spokesman for Momentum, the Left-wing pressure group, claimed the revelation that the NEC investigation had concluded in December showed Sir Keir had been “lying”. He said: “The whole process has served to expose the fiction that the Labour leadership’s handling of the whip is independent and that what is happening has nothing to do with Starmer. It has everything to do with him. “Clearly it has been in his hands and in the hands of the chief whip for months now and they have been pretending it isn’t to try and push Diane out. Now they have been exposed and they have a choice – do they really want to go ahead with forcing out Britain’s first black woman MP or do they want to do the right thing, let her back in and let her run?” Asked whether he had given misleading answers over Ms Abbott’s case, Sir Keir, speaking at an event in Stevenage , said: “The process as a whole obviously involves both the findings of fact and then the consequent action on the back of that, which the chief whip is overseeing.  “That always takes time. So the process as a whole was not completed, but in the end, it’s a matter for the NEC.” Asked when a decision would be made, he added: “I think fairly soon. The question of candidates is being finalised at the moment.”  Following her suspension from the party last year, Ms Abbott apologised for her remarks and claimed they were a first draft sent to The Observer  in error. In March, she claimed Labour would not return the whip because she was too critical of the party leadership. She has said Labour’s economic policy is not Left-wing enough and advocated a return to policies advocated by Mr Corbyn. Last week, the former Labour leader announced that he would stand against Labour  as an independent candidate in Islington North, presenting a major headache for Sir Keir. The Labour Party has been contacted for comment.

I’m convinced we can do that here.”Sir Keir added: “The grid is a big problem because it’s taking far too long. If you want to build a wind farm it takes you two years. It’d take you 13 years under this government to get any power out of it... We’ve got to take the tough decisions to cut through that.

Speaking to Camilla Tominey and Kamal Ahmed on The Daily T podcast in his first major interview of the election campaign, he said: “It doesn’t anger me. I mean, it puzzles me.

Nigel Lawson is one of the titans of Conservative politics, particularly as a chancellor. I’ve always been an enormous admirer of his.“I believe my approach to economics is squarely Thatcherite: control inflation first, get borrowing under control and then cut taxes.

There is too much waste, it’s too slow and we don’t always get value for money. That is something Rachel will bear down on. Just try getting money out of Rachel in a hurry.“Rachel understands that taxpayers’ money is taxpayers’ money and therefore you should look after it as carefully as you look after your own money. With your own finances you don’t waste money on things that aren’t value for money, nobody does that, and it shouldn’t be any different.”Ms Reeves added: “One of the things that has angered me most in this Parliament is the billions and billions of pounds handed out during the pandemic to companies that didn’t deliver on the contracts. I bet that when you sign a contract, if you don’t get what you put in that contract, you do everything in your power to get your money back. And that is what governments should be doing for contracts that didn’t deliver in the pandemic.“We need to look from the bottom up at everything government spends money on and make sure as Keir says we treat public money with respect and get value for money for it.”28 May 2024-03:25PM GMTStarmer: The choice is pretty straightforwardSir Keir Starmer said ahead of his question-and-answer session at Airbus that the upcoming general election was “a big moment... your choice really, really matters that day”.“The choice is pretty straightforward.

My colleague Amy Gibbons writes:A leaked memo, which was accidentally sent to some MPs as an attachment to a general campaign email, sparked outrage by naming and shaming those who were refusing to knock on doors or had taken time off to attend family events.Mims Davies, the minister for disabled people, health and work, dismissed the leak as a “distraction” and a Westminster “bubble story”, but said “of course, we always have to be honest with ourselves if we’re not working hard enough”.Asked if she could understand why some MPs might feel angry, she told BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme: “Of course in reality we all set our own campaign plans out.

We will work together and be able to build more houses as a result at speed. “That will have an impact on the rented sector which is acutely pressurised in terms of the rents that people are paying.”28 May 2024-02:07PM GMTPatrick O’Flynn: The BBC can’t stand Nigel FarageWhenever presenters on the BBC seemingly reveal their bias, people talk about “the mask slipping”, writesPatrick O’Flynn.So it is today in the case of the BBC News Channel presenter Geeta Guru-Murthy. She commented as follows after the channel cut away from a Nigel Farage election press conference and back to the studio: “Nigel Farage with his…um…customary inflammatory language there.”Yet since the bias exhibited in such episodes is almost invariably in favour of a Left-wing world view, it is odd that we talk about it being masked at all.Rather, it is almost always in plain sight if you bother looking out for it, but usually confines itself to phrases that indirectly imply that one view is to be favoured over another. Every now and then, however, the quiet part that underpins it all gets said out loud and a rumpus ensues.Patrick O’Flynn: There is a systematic bias at the BBC 28 May 2024-02:03PM GMTLaura Kuenssberg and Clive Myrie to front BBC’s election nightThe BBC has announced that Clive Myrie and Laura Kuenssberg will lead its election night coverage next month.They replace Huw Edwards, who anchored the broadcaster’s election night coverage in 2019 and took over from David Dimbleby, who had filled the role since 1979.Kuenssberg, who hosts a weekly Sunday morning politics programme, and Myrie, the Mastermind presenter and BBC newsreader, will also be joined by Chris Mason, the BBC’s political editor.It is the first time that a duo has been chosen to front the BBC election night coverage.

signed up in principle to the event, with specifics being ironed out before an announcement in the near future.It comes after the Tories pressed Sir Keir to take part in a record six debates during the election campaign, one a week.Labour headquarters has indicated instead that their leader will take part in two head-to-head debates, matching what Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn did in the 2019 election campaign.Conservative sources had dubbed the Opposition leader “the knight that won’t fight” and “Sir Fear Starmer” after he failed to sign up to their weekly debate demand.The event is a

shot in the dark, party insiders insist.Tory strategists first started canvassing the public about it in January, and became convinced it was the sort of idea that would win back voters drifting towards Reform UK.Unsurprisingly, it was a hit with older generations who have fond memories of post-war conscription, but it also appealed to one of the broadest groups of all: parents.Feedback from focus groups showed that a modern-day version of national service was a hit with parents who worry that their teenagers are unprepared for the world that awaits them and “think they are all going to

There’s this assumption that they’re now going to start moving as soon as the election campaign is called.“But I think what we’ve seen so far in the race is that Rishi Sunak isn’t a great campaigner, frankly.

Unofficially... look, he’s a friend of mine. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a pro-British president in the White House rather than one who absolutely loathes us?”Asked what he meant by British values, Mr Farage replied: “If you see the victory celebrations for the local councillors from Burnley to Bradford to elsewhere, no women. This is a new form... The idea that I’m saying this is all British Muslims is absolute nonsense.“I think the most concerned group, the most worried group, about what’s going on with this new form of sectarianism is British Muslims who are working, paying their taxes, wanting their kids to do well. It’s them that are perhaps going to be the worst affected by this if this current unpleasant trend continues.“Of course there are social conservatives, but perhaps not quite to the same degree... When 23 per cent of 18-to-24-year-olds say they support the concept of jihad, I put it to you that that’s not exactly a British value. It’s obvious to everyone that since Oct 7 there has been increased radicalisation in this country. I never thought I’d speak to some friends who’ve got a Jewish girl at a British university...“She’s getting real abuse to the point of ‘do I really want to be part of this?’ So I think there are some pretty disturbing trends.

Third-party campaign groups spent unbelievable sums of money putting negativity through people’s doors, the likes of which you can’t believe.“The Conservatives cheated to such an extent that one of the agents got a nine-month prison sentence for such overspending...

We’ve given them a vast sum of money, it is not working, and the French navy should not be doing what it’s doing.”He added: “Not a declaration of war, we don’t intend to have that...

That is their record and they deserve to be judged on it. The Conservatives have failed on the economy.

Quite honestly I don’t think, whether it’s the Channel, whether it’s legal migration, there’s any difference between the Labour and Conservative parties whatsoever.”Mr Farage said the French navy should not be escorting migrants and if it got “serious” migrants would be deterred from jumping into the water from their boats.“I understand saving lives at sea. I tell you what, more people will die if we continue to allow more people to cross the Channel than if we intervene and intercept and make sure that it won’t be allowed. And this is above all the responsibility of the French.”28 May 2024-09:23AM GMTFarage: Reform has a six-year planNigel Farage said he changed the Brexit Party’s name to Reform because it is a “six-year plan”.“This is not about a quick hit in a few weeks’ time, this is all about building a base from which we go on and launch a serious assault at the next general election in 2028 or 2029 or whenever it may be... I hope and pray we get a cohort of MPs in Westminster so we can be the opposition.”Asked about joining the Conservatives, Mr Farage said: “It’s more likely that you finish up with a Canada type situation of 30 years ago where a party coincidentally called Reform became the new party of the centre-Right in Canadian politics and Steven Harper who was first elected as a Reform MP became ultimately the premier of a brand new conservative movement. And I think that’s where we see ourselves, that’s how we see ourselves looking ahead.”“It’s not easy under first-past-the-post, I’ve never pretended it is... But that’s the plan.”28 May 2024-09:21AM GMTFarage: The Tories have destroyed themselves-they don’t need my helpAsked if he was seeking to join or destroy the Conservative Party, Nigel Farage replied: “They’ve destroyed themselves already, they don’t need my help. What Conservative Party? Is there a Conservative Party? I haven’t spotted it.“All I can see is two big social democrat parties. If you look at economies and many, many other areas, the policies are virtually identical. Yeah, sure, there’s VAT on school fees and there are one or two things. But I can’t think there’s ever been less of a choice, I can’t think there’s ever been such a lack of debate, genuine debate.”Mr Farage said Red Wall voters felt “totally betrayed, totally let down... it’s not just immigration, it’s self-employed, small business owners, feeling like Brexit should have brought some easing of the rules and in some case the rules have actually got worse”.Of Reform voters, he said: “Even if we packed up tomorrow, they wouldn’t go back to the Conservatives... They’ve wrecked it for themselves. They’ll come out with the same argument, they’ll say that a vote for Reform is a vote for Labour. But when the public realise this election is a foregone conclusion, Labour are going to win and they’re going to win quite big, you can argue actually that a vote for the Conservative Party is a wasted vote.“And given you know Labour are going to win, why not vote for something you actually believe in? The Conservatives will be in opposition but they won’t be an opposition. They’re too divided, too ineffective.”28 May 2024-09:17AM GMTFarage: I’ve been ahead of the curve on leaving the ECHRNigel Farage said leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was a “massive political issue” he had been “ahead of the curve on”.“No one was talking about it then, but you’re all talking about it now.”28 May 2024-09:15AM GMTLib Dems want to put Feargal Sharkey on a water company boardThe Lib Dems want to put Feargal Sharkey on the board of a water company to hold bosses accountable for sewage spills, Tim Sigsworthwrites.Tim Farron, its environment spokesman, told BBC Radio 4’s Today the party would scrap regular Ofwat and put locals and campaigners on water company boards.“If Feargal Sharkey wants to be on a water board, we’d love him to be so,” Mr Farron said of the environmental campaigner.The former Lib Dem leader also ruled out nationalising water companies because the money spent would not be used to expand and modernise infrastructure.He was speaking ahead of a visit by Sir Ed Davey to Lake Windermere, where in February the BBC uncovered that millions of litres of raw sewage had been pumped into the lake by United Utilities.28 May 2024-09:14AM GMTFarage: Sunak has betrayed Brexit and we must leave the ECHRNigel Farage said the Labour immigration policy was “a joke”, adding Sir Keir Starmer’s party “haven’t got a policy”.“There’s no way just going for the gangs is going to make a difference. He’s even talking about joining up with an EU scheme that might finish up with us taking more people than we are at this moment in time. Neither side has any credible policy at all.”He added: “To Brexit voters, what happened in the English Channel is a serious affront and they see frankly us allowing it to continue as being a betrayal of what they voted for in the referendum and what they trusted the Conservatives with in the general election and that massive 80-seat majority in 2019.“And I have to say I feel that too...

You’ll have noticed not a single woman in the room.“So we’re moving into an age in our inner cities and towns I’m worried to say of sectarian politics, with women completely excluded.”28 May 2024-09:08AM GMTFarage: We should declare national security emergencyNigel Farage said of the illegal Channel crossings: “Frankly, I think this is very dangerous.“You only have to look at what’s happened in Sweden in cities like Malmo to see that a large influx of young males coming from an entirely different culture, and certainly coming from a culture in which women are not even regarded as second-class citizens, has had frankly disastrous social effects.“But since the events of Oct 7 and what has happened in Gaza, and increased radicalisation in the Middle East, this is even more of a problem. You see, these young men that come, and I’ve actually filmed this, people throwing their iPhones into the sea, throwing their passports into the sea, doing everything they can so we can’t track and identify them...“I think this is a national security issue. Now if you think I’m being over the top let’s think about our friend Donald Tusk... Very much an EU luvvie, now of course the prime minister of Poland. He has talked about the wave of, and I’m using his words not mine, aggressive young males that are coming into Poland having crossed the Mediterranean and he has said that it’s a matter of national security for Poland.“What we ought to be doing here is declaring a national security emergency, and this is an emergency.”28 May 2024-09:06AM GMTI was called all the names under the sun but ‘invasion’ was correct, says FarageNigel Farage said he was “called all the names under the sun” for referring to an “invasion”.“But 3,800 boats later, 125,000 people later, you can use whatever words you want. I happen to think ‘invasion’ frankly was pretty appropriate. So I’ve campaigned hard on this issue over a four year period... I was right. And that’s what I’ve done in my career, I’m an issues campaigner above all.“Nobody was talking about it when I started but everyone is talking about it now.”Mr Farage noted the vast majority of Channel migrants are under the age of 40 and male, adding: “People see the unfairness of it. They say how can it be that we’re on social housing waiting lists for a year, perhaps two years, when these people who come are put into four-star hotels or private accommodation?“I think the fact the hotels alone are costing £7m a day makes people pretty upset. Those who come into the country legally aren’t very happy about it either because they went through costs, time and hoops to go through it the right way.”28 May 2024-09:03AM GMTFarage: Sunak looks like a frightened rabbitNigel Farage said Dover is “the frontline of the great national debate on immigration, both illegal and legal”.“I don’t know about you, but I feel like this election campaign has got off to the dullest start I can ever remember in my entire life.“Two men with the appearance and enthusiasm of middle managers vying to become our national leader. Indeed I do my best to listen to Keir Starmer when he’s being interviewed or giving a speech and I find myself zoning out halfway through. There’s no energy, there’s no enthusiasm, there’s no real substantive policy.“As for the Prime Minister, I have to laugh, the word ‘bold’ is the word they keep using. But actually when asked a question by somebody, he looks more like a frightened rabbit than someone who is bold.“I am of course very disappointed, I did have a six-month plan that would have helped me find a seat and campaign around the country. I felt in six weeks I can’t do both.”Mr Farage said he was among the first to point out that the “trickle” of illegal migrants had now become a “flood”.28 May 2024-09:01AM GMTHoward Cox to stand as Reform candidateHoward Cox, the founder of FairFuelUK, confirms he will stand as Reform’s candidate in Dover and Deal.28 May 2024-08:50AM GMTScots can end SNP independence push with defeat in electionScots can end the SNP’s push for independence by inflicting a “once-in-a-generation” defeat in the general election, Douglas Ross has said ahead of launching the Scottish Tory campaign in John Swinney’s “backyard”.The Scottish Tory leader will travel on Tuesday morning to Perth to formally kickstart his party’s bid, arguing the election was the chance to “finally end their independence demands for good”.Senior SNP figures including Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond said at the time of the 2014 independence referendum that it was a “once-in-a-generation event”.But Mr Ross said that, following their defeat, the SNP has instead “focused only on independence at the expense of everything else”.Simon Johnson, our Scottish Political Editor, has more 28 May 2024-08:32AM GMTLord Cameron: ‘Deeply distressing’ scenes in Rafah after Israeli airstrikesThis from the Foreign Secretary just now on X:Deeply distressing scenes following the airstrikes in Rafah this weekend.

A leaked memo, which was accidentally sent to some MPs as an attachment to a general campaign email, named and shamed those who were refusing to knock on doors or had taken time off to attend family events. It prompted fury amongst MPs, many of whom are already incensed that Rishi Sunak called a snap election despite trailing in the polls. In response, the Prime Minister said he took personal responsibility for his party’s lacklustre opening to the campaign, which has been criticised. The memo, which was leaked to The Times, listed a number of Tory candidates by name and identified their failure to “get behind” the party’s re-election efforts as a “key theme”.

This would bring the personal allowance – the level at which tax starts being payable – to just above the state pension and would rise alongside it. For non-pensioners, the tax threshold, which has been frozen since 2021, would stay the same.  The number of pensioners liable for tax has doubled since 2010, rising to more than nine million.

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It is a tax cut because in the absence of doing this, people will be paying more tax so we will be cutting their tax. We have an existing set of tax arrangements, that’s not unusual, it happens through time. “Because we’ve got the economy going, because we’ve got growth going, because we’ve got inflation down, because we’ve taken the bold and difficult decisions to achieve those things, we are now able to cut taxes.”                      28 May 2024-07:08AM GMT                                         Labour frontbencher refuses to say whether Diane Abbott will be party candidate                    Challenged on whether Diane Abbott would stand as a Labour candidate, the shadow business secretary said: “We’ve had a general election that only the Prime Minister seemed to know about, we are almost completing our candidate selection. I can’t talk about specific cases.” Asked again, Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The process we have in the Labour Party is frankly not one that any politician in the Labour Party decides. So I can’t give you an answer on that. “We want that situation resolved, we all want to see that resolved. I genuinely don’t know the circumstances that you’re describing. I think in any disciplinary matter you need both sides to engage in it, I genuinely have no additional information other than that but we are all keen to see every situation like this resolved as soon as possible.”                      28 May 2024-07:04AM GMT                                         ‘Capitalist-flavoured socialism’                    On the difference between Jeremy Corbyn and Sir Keir Starmer, Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “They will want to know how people describe their own politics, the values they have got, but they’ll also want to know what they want to do, that’s what people judge any politician on. “And when it comes to the economy, if you look at who’s offering the stability economic growth comes from, the industrial strategy we need, ambition on net zero, making the Brexit relationship work better with the European Union, doing planning reform to get things built in the UK, the apprenticeship levy, that is what Labour is offering. “That is why Labour has changed to offer a platform like that and that is why business is endorsing Labour today... It is testament to our plans for the future.” Mr Reynolds said BBC Radio 4’s description of “capitalist-flavoured socialism” sounded like “a university seminar”. “I would call myself a Christian socialist, a progressive. I think the best traditions of government delivered in the UK, whether it’s the National Parks or the NHS, have come from a similar background to mine, but I could also point to the fact that the economy has tended to grow more strongly under those kinds of politicians because people have been at the heart of their plans, good jobs, good work, the kind of jobs you can raise your families around... That’s the kind of the economy that I want and that’s the kind of economy a lot of people want.”                      28 May 2024-07:00AM GMT                                         Shadow business secretary: I am a Christian socialist                    Asked if he was a socialist, Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Yes, I would describe myself as a Christian socialist in the best traditions of that because that’s about putting people first. And of course to do that you’ve got to have a set of proposals, a set of policy that will deliver for people. “And if you look at what the UK needs right now it is an economy that grows more strongly, that gives people higher living standards... I want a better society, a fairer society, but that requires working in partnership with business, with unions, to give the UK the kind of economy it needs.” Challenged on how Sir Keir Starmer describing himself as a socialist differed from Jeremy Corbyn being a socialist, Mr Reynolds replied: “That feels a bit academic as a debate.” When it was put to him Sir Keir was Mr Corbyn’s “right-hand man”, Mr Reynolds said: “Well I don’t think that is correct but look sometimes in a political party you’ve got to serve. I did a job as shadow economic secretary which was about the City and finances, we were facing a no-deal Brexit, we needed people in Parliament to make sure we had the right thing in place. Sometimes in politics you’ve got to serve and you don’t get to pick exactly how you’d like that configuration to be but that’s about public service.”                      28 May 2024-06:56AM GMT                                         Reynolds: Labour would get investment and growth up                    Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, welcomed the endorsement of 120 business leaders for Sir Keir Starmer’s plans. Asked whether he was now “hand in glove” with business, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s absolutely what is required for the economy to grow more strongly than it has done for the last 14 years. “If you look at what business figures are saying, it’s that it’s time for change and only Labour has a plan to grow the economy... This is about what will benefit working people and a big part of our package is our proposals to make work pay. “Unless any future government gets business investment up because it’s the lowest in the G7, gets better productivity, gets better growth... Stagnation will only continue and that’s what we’ve got to break out of.”                      28 May 2024-06:39AM GMT                                         Mel Stride: I wouldn’t call Keir Starmer ‘Sir Sleepy’                    On what role Boris Johnson would play in the general election, Mel Stride, the Work and Pensions Secretary, said: “I have no idea but I know that he’s a very solid, vigorous Conservative and I would expect him to be fully supportive of a Conservative victory on July 4. “I don’t know what his plans are, sorry... I have no idea. I don’t know. This isn’t about one particular former prime minister. These are big issues that we’re looking at in this election, we are looking at a party that has brought us through some of the most difficult times for this country since the Second World War, has reached a turning point for the economy, has got real wages growing, has got growth going. “We have some time to go before the general election. But that is why we are fighting so hard to make this point and that’s why Keir Starmer should step up to those debates and tell us what he really stands for.” Asked about ‘Sir Sleepy’ briefings by Tory Party sources, Mr Stride replied: “It’s not a term that I have used or would use. I think whatever age you are in life, I think people have a huge amount to contribute. I’m in the same bracket so I should declare an interest. But equally what does matter is what you stand for. “He’s trying to keep as low a profile as possible, not telling us what [Labour] stands for, having no plan and expecting to just drift over the line and that is not good enough and that is why Sir Keir Starmer should step up to the plate and debate with our Prime Minister every week. Every week we should be applying that scrutiny so we can actually find out what No Idea Keir is all about.”                      28 May 2024-06:36AM GMT                                         Stride hails ‘triple lock plus’                    Mel Stride said millions of pensioners would receive a tax cut over time through the party’s new plan. Mr Stride told Sky News: “On the basic state pension, if that is your form of income, then under our plans we will make sure that you are covered by the personal allowance, in other words you’re in that no-tax band. “By 2027 if you don’t do that, as Labour propose, you will see millions of pensioners paying tax for the first time with all of the red tape, all of the paperwork that goes with it.” He added: “Clearly if you’re earning hundreds of thousands of pounds for example elsewhere, you’re going to pay tax on it. But if you’re on the basic state pension and that is your income, then you will be protected from paying tax because we will make sure that the personal tax allowance rises by the triple lock uprating, which is why we call it the triple lock plus.”                      28 May 2024-06:33AM GMT                                         We are fighting for absolutely every vote, says Mel Stride                    Mel Stride said the Government was making “huge progress” on the economy. “The polls are where the polls are at the moment. The only poll that matters is the one on election day... It may make you chuckle. We’ve got a long way to go,” he told Sky News. On Steve Baker campaigning from his holiday in Greece, Mr Stride added: “I can’t comment on what Steve [Baker] is doing or where he is or what he’s up to, he may be designing his literature, he may be making telephone calls. “We are fighting for absolutely vote. Now I know we’re behind in the polls and that is why we are working so hard now to try and get across the line because it really matters to the future of our country and I’ve described the progress that we’ve made. We’ve come through a really tough time where we had Covid, we had the war in Ukraine... “We are at an inflection point, we have turned the corner. And my message would be let’s not blow that to a party under Keir Starmer where we don’t even know what he stands for. We have a clear plan that’s working.”                      28 May 2024-06:30AM GMT                                         Stride: ‘It says they’ve got a letter together with 200 names on it’                    Mel Stride dismissed a letter to The Times by 120 business leaders endorsing Labour’s plan for the economy. Asked what it said about the Conservatives, the Work and Pensions Secretary told Sky News: “It says they’ve got a letter together with 200 names on it. There are no names on it I think in the FTSE 100, one of the biggest businesses in the country.” Mr Stride recalled support from 200 business leaders for the Tory policy of ‘full expensing’. “What really matters here is who’s going to be the party who’s got the right plan and can get growth going... [Inflation] very much has a Government component because you have to get your spending right in order to control inflation, what they call the right fiscal policy, so resisting pay demands and things like that.... “We are turning a corner now. We are at an inflection point for the UK economy and things are going to improve going forward, we don’t want to go back to square one.” Asked whether business leaders endorsing Labour was “inconsequential”, he replied: “I didn’t say inconsequential... There are not the kind of businesses that supported the biggest tax cut for business, full expensing, in modern times.”                      28 May 2024-06:19AM GMT                                         State pension will never be taxed, vows Sunak                    The state pension will never be taxed under the Conservatives, Rishi Sunak will declare today. The Prime Minister will announce plans to give retirees “peace of mind and security” by automatically raising the threshold at which they start paying income tax each year so that it stays ahead of the state pension.Labour failed to match the pledge – dubbed the quadruple lock – on Monday with the Tories warning that Sir Keir Starmer was lining up a huge tax raid on the elderly.It comes after criticism of the Tories for freezing income tax thresholds, which pulled people into higher tax bands, or into paying income tax for the first time through fiscal drag.Downing Street said its proposals would mean eight million pensioners would save £100 in tax from next year and almost £300 a year by the end of the decade.

One mother who contacted her local council about the possibility of moving her child from private to state education ahead of Sir Keir Starmer’s proposed 20 per cent hike in fees was told that secondary schools are so oversubscribed that students are on a waiting list and if “any” places become available they will be “extremely limited”. The message from officials at Newcastle city council is echoed across the country, with at least eight authorities warning that there are few to no places available and one stating that there is “no guarantee” of an immediate space. It comes amid fears of a pupil exodus from private to state schools after Sir Keir promised that he would initiate the tax raid on “day one” of a Labour government.

The panel of Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) completed its work in December following Ms Abbott’s suspension from the party eight months previously, BBC Newsnight reported. At this point, Ms Abbott was asked to complete a two hour online anti-Semitism awareness training course, which she did in February. The matter was subsequently passed to Sir Alan Campbell, the opposition chief whip, but Ms Abbott has not heard anything since a meeting with Sir Alan. Ms Abbott, who was in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, was stripped of the whip last year and has been subject to an internal investigation. She was kicked out as a Labour MP after penning a letter to the Observer that suggested Jewish people did not experience racism “all their lives”.                      28 May 2024-06:01AM GMT                                         Sir Keir: Scotland can play its part in ‘stopping the chaos’                    Scotland has a chance to “stop the chaos”, Sir Keir Starmer has said as he attempts to gain support north of the border. Writing for the Daily Record, the Labour leader accused both the SNP and the Conservatives of “playing on the fears of working people”. The first Scottish poll of the election campaign showed his party five points ahead of the SNP. Sir Keir said: “The government I lead will be dedicated to restoring the ordinary hope important to working Scots. “That means smashing the class ceiling. Creating opportunities for all. Delivering the high-skill, high-pay jobs of the future that Scotland needs. “Because after 17 years of SNP failure and 14 years of Tory chaos, Scotland is crying out for change.”                      28 May 2024-05:57AM GMT                                         Don’t overlook ‘shy Tories’ says expert pollster                    Support for Sir Keir Starmer is overestimated and it is possible for the Conservatives to overturn Labour’s lead, a leading pollster has suggested. Lord Hayward, who coined the term “shy Tories” in 1992 after his party’s unexpected general election victory, said he was worried fellow election experts were “getting it wrong” in trying to project the result on July 4. The Telegraph’s poll of polls shows Labour has an average lead of around 20 percentage points across major pollsters, suggesting Rishi Sunak has a mountain to climb if his party is to secure a historic fifth term in Downing Street. But speaking to the Guardian, Lord Hayward said: “About 33 years on, I am yet again convinced that a statistical bias exists in the polls.” Read the full story here                      28 May 2024-05:50AM GMT                                         Even as she departs, May remains tight-lipped                    Does Theresa May get PTSD whenever an election is called? writesJasper Rees. Seven confusing and largely horrible years ago she went out on the stump with a lordly lead in the polls and returned to a hung parliament. “I made some mistakes during the election campaign,” she forced herself to concede in Theresa May: The Accidental Prime Minister (ITV1).

We do know that Chris Wilkins, her head of strategy, is “still angry” at the tone-deafness of her U-turn over the policy dubbed the dementia tax. “I think that drove a coach and horses through her brand,” he simmered. It’s never quite clear from this portrait what May’s brand is or was, beyond a belief in probity and a commitment to service, plus a large collection of cookbooks. Review: ITV draws May on the naughtiest thing she’s ever done                      28 May 2024-05:44AM GMT                                         Keir Starmer: I am a socialist who will put country before party                    Sir Keir Starmer has described himself as a socialist who “always puts the country first and party second”. Asked if he would use that word to describe himself, Sir Keir told the BBC: “Yes, I would describe myself as a socialist. I describe myself as a progressive. I’d describe myself as somebody who always puts the country first and party second.” Sir Keir, widely viewed as a centrist, joined the Labour Party Young Socialists in East Surrey when he was a teenager and helped found the radical magazine Socialist Alternatives after graduating from Leeds University. He went on to describe himself as a socialist during the 2020 leadership campaign. However, the Labour leader has since been accused of a purge of the Labour Left, including figures such as his Left-wing predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, who is now planning to run against his old party as an independent on July 4.

Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general, warned voters would “pay the price in the end” as he branded the Tories’ election campaign “desperate”. He attacked the Prime Minister’s proposals to bring back national service, costing £2.5bn, and to permanently exempt the state pension from tax at a cost of £2.4bn a year. Speaking at the launch of Labour’s election battle bus, he said: “Day after day the Tories are making billions of pounds worth of commitments out of desperation. “They are splurging out desperate commitments with no explanation of where the money is coming from. This is typical Tories-chaotic with the public finances and it is the British people who pay the price in the end.” The Tories have said the national service plan would be funded with cash previously earmarked for levelling up, whilst the pensions play would be paid for with the proceeds from a £6bn crackdown on tax avoidance.                      28 May 2024-05:39AM GMT                                         Good morning                                         Dominic Penna here, The Telegraph’s Political Correspondent, guiding you through day six of the general election campaign along with my colleagues in the Telegraph Lobby team.
