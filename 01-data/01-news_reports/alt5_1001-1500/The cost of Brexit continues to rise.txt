   The cost of Brexit continues to rise Evening Chronicle January 17, 2024 Wednesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Newcastle Chronicle & Journal Ltd. All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 32 Length: 250 words Body   I WAS interested to read last week that the cost of Brexit is still rising inexorably and is continuing to do our country great harm. Modelling about how our economy would have developed in recent years and into the future if we had stayed in the EU, undertaken by economists and analysts at Cambridge Econometrics, suggests that we are taking a huge hit as a result of Brexit. This data has been compared to official data on how our economy has performed up until March 2023 and the OBR forecasts for the future. It turns out that Brexit has cost the nation £140bn so far and is set to cost us up to £311bn by the middle of the next decade. This is a staggering amount of money. It is, of course, also money that could have been used to help build up our NHS, rebuild our education system, modernise our creaking railway system and clean up our dirty water. It could also have been used to help bring our young people, here in the North East, good, well-paid new jobs in the green economy as part of a just transition to a carbon neutral economy. One thing is for sure. Those who caused Brexit, very wealthy men like Cameron, Johnson and Farage, will not suffer any great financial pain as a result of the huge losses of money lost to our economy. It will be the working people of our country who will bear the brunt of the Brexit disaster, just as it has been the working people who have suffered so far as Broken Britain has become an ever greater reality for millions of people.
