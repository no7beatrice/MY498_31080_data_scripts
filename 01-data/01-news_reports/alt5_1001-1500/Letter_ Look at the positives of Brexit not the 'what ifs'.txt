   Letter: Look at the positives of Brexit not the 'what ifs' Stroud News and Journal March 5, 2024 Tuesday  Copyright 2024 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Length: 225 words Byline: Matthew Holmes Body   Reference Howard Price-s over-long post on Brexit (SNJ Feb 28), I remain happy that I voted with majority of population OUT in Referendum although admittedly I-m in a minority here in Stroud. But the UK is a democratic country and pleased Boris succeeded in -leave- rather than country meandering aimlessly in no man-s land. Obviously some of the ambitions of Brexit have been partly derailed because of COVID and the war in Ukraine. Nevertheless UK has grown faster than most of our main competitors and has signed major economic agreements outside the EU that would be impossible if UK was still within. Mr Price refers to an alleged financial expert who claims UK is 125 bn poorer through Brexit, an amount that would normally create an almighty row in Westminster. BUT there has been none, thus creating grave doubts on this forecaster-s dubious figures. And even if he were correct the UK would have to live with it: the door back to the EU is firmly shut, locked and bolted. In September 2023 Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, ruled out the possibility of the UK rejoining the EU under a Starmer-led Labour government. He now says he-s after closer ties with the EU - something I support. Mr Price needs to accept return to EU is merely his pipe dream and start to look on positives of Brexit rather than worry about -what ifs-.
