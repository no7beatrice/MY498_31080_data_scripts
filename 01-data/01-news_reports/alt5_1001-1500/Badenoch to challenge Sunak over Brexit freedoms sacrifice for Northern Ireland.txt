   Badenoch to challenge Sunak over Brexit freedoms sacrifice for Northern Ireland telegraph.co.uk January 25, 2024 Thursday 9:44 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 655 words Byline: By James Crisp, Europe Editor, Nick Gutteridge, Whitehall Correspondent Highlight: Business Secretary will question PM’s plan to prevent extra trade barriers in the Irish Sea in attempt to end DUP’s Stormont boycott Body   Kemi Badenoch will challenge Rishi Sunak over his plan to sacrifice some Brexit freedoms to re-establish a devolved government in Northern Ireland. The Business Secretary vowed to raise the issue at the “highest level” after being questioned over the Prime Minister’s attempt to convince the DUP to end its Stormont boycott after almost two years. In a move which has angered Tory Brexiteers, the Government has promised all new laws will be screened to ensure they don’t create extra trade barriers in the Irish Sea border between Britain and Northern Ireland , which was created as part of post-Brexit trading arrangements. Tory MPs including former leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg warned that the move would tie Britain to European standards after the plan was revealed by the Telegraph  on Wednesday. Ms Badenoch, a fervent Brexiteer, did not deny the report when she was confronted by former Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers in the House of Commons. Ms Villiers, an ex-Cabinet minister, asked, “Is she in a position to deny a report in The Telegraph today that the Government has pledged to introduce a requirement that all future regulatory law change will be screened to ensure that they don’t create extra trade barriers in the Irish Sea? “Because that could be a significant impediment in the way of divergence from EU laws.”                      ‘We retain the ability to diverge’                    Ms Badenoch said: “I can’t, of course, comment on the Northern Ireland political process which is ongoing, and in which I am not a participant. “However, what I will say is that we retain the ability to diverge. That is clear. And I do agree with her that if we are really to seize the benefits of Brexit we need to find that comparative advantage in our regulations with the EU, otherwise there would be no point.” She added: “I do understand her concerns, I will speak to colleagues across departments and make sure they are raised at the highest level.” While the UK will legally be able to diverge, there are fears the screening process will have a chilling effect on moves to do so. Ms Badenoch has previously blamed Whitehall’s intransigence for the failure to scrap as much EU red tape after Brexit as she would have liked as Business Secretary. The Telegraph can exclusively reveal further details of Mr Sunak’s offer to DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson , under which unionists will be able to force an investigation into the Brexit border with a majority vote in Stormont. The Northern Ireland Assembly must vote on whether to continue with the Irish Sea border by the end of this year, in a “consent” vote which is expected to pass with majority support. However, if there is a majority of unionist Assembly members against the Windsor Framework , an independent report will be commissioned. The offer makes new commitments around that promise to unionists, which was made as part of the Windsor Framework shortly after it was agreed in February. The report will have to be commissioned within a month and be finished within six. It must focus on the UK internal market and Northern Ireland’s constitutional status. The Government will have to respond and it has promised to discuss the report findings with the EU. It has also repeated earlier undertakings to seek further cuts in border checks on British goods from the bloc. A government spokesperson said: “We do not comment on speculation.” It comes after The Telegraph reported Mr Sunak is ready to rename the border’s “Green Lane”, the “UK Internal Market Lane”  as part of a patriotic rebrand of the contentious arrangements. The offer also includes legislation guaranteeing Northern Ireland’s place in the UK, a new East-West council on intra-UK trade ties and £3.3bn of funding for Stormont. The DUP confirmed on Thursday that threats made against Sir Jeffrey for his efforts to strike a deal with the Government had been reported to the police. Load-Date: January 25, 2024  End of Document
