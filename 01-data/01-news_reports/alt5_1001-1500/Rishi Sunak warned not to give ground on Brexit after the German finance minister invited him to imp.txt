   Rishi Sunak warned not to give ground on Brexit after the German finance minister invited him to improve the UK's trade deal with Brussels MailOnline October 14, 2023 Saturday 9:37 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:2 Length: 685 words Byline: Anna Mikhailova Body   Brexiteer Tory MPs claimed the offer would have too many strings attached                      Rishi Sunak was warned last night not to give ground on Brexit after the German finance minister invited him to improve the UK's trade deal with Brussels. Christian Lindner declared: 'If you want to intensify your trade relationship with the EU - call us!' Government insiders said Germany's willingness to forge closer links proved that 'Brexit naysayers were completely wrong'. But Brexiteer Tory MPs claimed the offer would have too many strings attached. Former Cabinet member Simon Clarke asked: 'At what price? We know there is no closer deal to be agreed without customs unions and single market membership, both of which would make Brexit pointless.' David Jones, deputy chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said: 'I'm sure German companies would love to do more business with the UK.' But he also warned that the German minister 'shouldn't hold his breath'. A Government source told The Mail on Sunday: 'We won't be calling them. We have the TCA [Brexit trade agreement] and we're not amending, changing or renegotiating it.' By contrast, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said he will seek 'a much better' relationship with the EU if he wins the next election. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves told the Labour Party Conference last week: 'Just because we accept Brexit, it doesn't mean we think we can't get a better deal.' Mr Clarke said: 'Labour's desire for a closer deal is either empty words or a Trojan Horse to overturn our vote for independence.' In a BBC interview, Mr Lindner stated that the UK had a 'standing invitation' on future talks aimed at reducing trade barriers. He went to say: 'In the daily life of German corporates, there are new obstacles since Brexit... I don't think [the] United Kingdom is benefiting from Brexit. 'We really appreciate the United Kingdom and its values, its people... and I would really, really appreciate it if we can intensify [the trade relationship] again.'

Lord Frost, former chief Brexit negotiator, responded: 'It would be much better if our European friends and partners concentrated on putting their own ramshackle Eurozone in order rather than constantly telling us how we should govern ourselves. 'If the EU ever wishes to offer a closer trading relationship that doesn't involve our accepting EU law, then that will be something new. But it's clear Lindner is not offering that and it is not in his power to offer it. Rather, he hopes we will be suckered back into the single market without a say in its rules, destroying our prospects as a global trader. I can see why that would be in Germany's interest but it is not in ours.' Mr Lindner's comments also opened up divisions within the EU over trade negotiations. Maros Sefcovic, who negotiated the Brexit trade deal, has previously ruled out reopening talks before a scheduled review in 2026. French MEP Nathalie Loiseau said of the German minister's remarks: 'I am surprised to hear him express views which aren't co-ordinated with EU27 and don't take into account the position expressed by the British Government.' Another UK Government source said: 'Since leaving the EU, we have seized the benefits of Brexit to sign trade deals with 71 nations and scrap red tape to help boost investment and growth across the UK. 'Of course we're happy to talk trade with Germany - as ever, the Brexit naysayers were completely wrong. It's in their best interests to access our dynamic economy and investment opportunities.' Germany's exports to the UK were 14.1 per cent lower last year than in 2016, according to the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce - with both German and British industry complaining about extra red tape since Brexit. Last week Mr Lindner met Chancellor Jeremy Hunt in Morocco as part of a summit organised by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. A Treasury source said the Brexit trade deal was not discussed. Load-Date: October 14, 2023  End of Document
