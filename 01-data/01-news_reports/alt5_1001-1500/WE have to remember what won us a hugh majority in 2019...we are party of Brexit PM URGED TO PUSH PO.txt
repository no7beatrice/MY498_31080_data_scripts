A series of his MPs warned that the Prime Minister must move on from "the gloom and doom" agenda of Remainers and his Labour opponents. Brendan Clarke-Smith, one of the Tories to break down Labour's Red Wall, said: "We have got to remember what won us an enormous majority in 2019. "We are the party of Brexit and opportunity. We are positive about this country's achievements and its potential especially with Brexit.We have to start talking up Brexit and Britain again and not just accept the gloom and doom narrative of the lefty Remainers." A survey by Redfield & Wilton Strategies found that 41 per cent of voters think Labour's Brexit policy is to rejoin, although Sir Keir Starmer has said he would not. With two polls showing the Tories heading for an election disaster with potentially fewer than 100 seats, many of the party's MPs say failure to properly deliver the benefits of Brexit is a root cause. In a Techne UK tracker poll for the Daily Express, only a third of 2016 Leave voters (34 per cent) would back the Tories - while 44 per cent who backed the party in 2019 have abandoned them. Former Brexit minister David Jones was blunt in his assessment of the Government's failure to make a positive case for Brexit. ty ns Writing for the Express today, the deputy chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs warns that Europhiles are "blaming Brexit for all the ills of the world and urging us to return to the orbit of Brussels. t mainers' ping rrative."

As Aspirational euro recessi nogB "The eurozone is currently in recession, we are not. Is it not time we heard more good news talking Britain up?" ig Red Wall MPs fighting to retain historic gains made by the Tories in 2019 backed the call. Marco Longhi said his party needs to put the positive case for leaving the EU. The Dudley North MP added: "Any narrative that talks down an economy will have consequences. Sometimes it feels like some people want things to fail if you listen to their doom and gloom." Mr Longhi is trade envoy to Brazil.The UK struck a deal with it to do more business with one of the world's fastest growing economies. He said: "The country voted for a positive aspirational, outward looking Great Britain when it voted for Brexit. Global Britain, unleashed from the shackles of the EU...now has a fantastic opportunity to motor ahead and lead the way in so many sectors delivering many more jobs and job security." Stoke North MP Jonathan Gullis warned that some Remainers see a chance to take the UK back into the bloc if the Government does not start being positive again. He said: "The Government needs to continue delivering on the huge benefits of Brexit. "But Brexit wasn't just about economics. We have restored our sovereignty so that we can control our laws and borders, giving power back to the British people." Ex-Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said: "We need to cut prices by deregulating. Brexit means we could import cheaper brands from America and abolish food tariffs. Such Brexit-enabled policies would help deal with the cost-of-living crisis. "We could also cut high-cost business and employment regulations to boost the economy. "Brexit is an enabler: it is for the Government to act." The City of London Corporation says Brexit has been a huge success for financial services.

A Downing Street spokeswoman insisted that the Prime Minister - who supported Leave in the 2016 referendum - has been talking about the benefits of Brexit and putting them into action. She said last night: "Just look at the [NHS] Long Term Workforce plan and some of the reform agenda in it. "If we hadn't left the EU, we wouldn't have been able to change nurse training from five years to four years [because of EU rules]." The spokeswoman continued: "The Prime Minister was talking that up at the press conference last week. The Retained EU Law Bill [allowing the UK to get rid of EU regulations] was passed without any rebellion." She also pointed out that the Prime Minister had championed the creation of freeports.
