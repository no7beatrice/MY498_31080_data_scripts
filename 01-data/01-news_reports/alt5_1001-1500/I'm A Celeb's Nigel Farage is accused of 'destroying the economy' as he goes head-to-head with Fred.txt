All Rights Reserved  Section: TV&SHOWBIZ; Version:1 Length: 652 words Byline: Eleanor Dye For Mailonline Body                        Nigel Farage and Fred Sirieix engaged in another heated debate over Brexit on Sunday night's episode of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! The ex-UKIP leader, 59, and First Dates star, 51, have frequently come to blows during their time in camp and maintain very different political positions.  And on Sunday things erupted once more while the campmates were cooking dinner - after Sam and Nella won 10 out of 12 stars for camp in the underwater Bushtucker trial.  Politician Nigel, 59, was the leader of the UK Independence Party from 2006 to 2009 and 2010 to 2016, and leader of the Brexit Party from 2019 to 2021, with a referendum on Brexit being held in 2016.  In their latest disagreement, Fred accused Nigel of 'destroying the economy' and 'creating a big mess' by encouraging the Brexit vote.  The Frenchman then asked the former UKIP leader to name the positives of the Brexit vote, which Nigel promptly declared were 'liberation', 'taking back control' and 'self-government'.  However, Fred interrupted to say: 'Don't make me laugh!'

Aiming to make peace in the camp, Nigel swiftly praised Fred's cooking, as the other campmates couldn't help but laugh at the fierce debate.                       Twitter users also found the debate hilarious, but were left divided over who they supported in the row.  One said: 'Impressive from Fred to simultaneously cook crab and Nigel Farage', while another added: 'Fred is a gem, I'm SO glad that he's in there to confront Nigel because no one else has the guts to.' However, others disagreed, with one saying: 'Fred is getting on my nerves, he takes over and doesn't listen to anyone else.' A second said: 'Nigel talks a lot of sense but people simply just don't want to hear it...'  Last week, the two came to blows over an initial discussion about Brexit.  Fred asked Nigel: 'What's the benefit of Brexit then? If you are an average person from Britain, what's the benefit?' Nigel said: 'To know that we're independent, we stand on our own two feet in the world.' Fred said: 'Brexit was about immigration, I remember your poster. I thought it was shameful what you did Nigel. Shameful.' Nigel replied: 'Sadly, sadly it was absolutely true. It was a poster showing mass young men moving illegally across borders.' Fred said: 'But it was about demonising migrants.' Nigel replied: 'No it wasn't. In your view it was, but it wasn't.' To which Fred said: 'It's not only just my view.' In the Bush Telegraph, Nigel said: 'I knew it wouldn't take long, I knew politics would rear its head as indeed it did. And Fred feels very strongly about it.' Having moved away to wash up, MasterChef star Grace Dent said to actor Nick Pickard: 'Brexit was his entire idea. It's his specialist subject. Fred's not going to change his mind on anything.' In the Bush Telegraph, Grace added: 'I would 100% rather wash up than listen to another single word about Brexit. I was just like, "Oh my god, I'm going to go and put my head in that stream".' Nigel also said: 'Brexit is about one thing and one thing only; being self-governing. We're in charge. We can get it right, we can make an absolute mess of it but we're in charge and the people who make those decisions we can hire and fire at elections where they have real power.' Fred said: 'I think the average person in the UK has lost out because of what you've done.' Nigel said: 'They haven't lost out.' In the Bush Telegraph, Fred added: 'Look, Nigel Farage is in the jungle with me. We're bound to have this conversation. At the end of the day nothing is going to change, Nigel believes what he believes, I believe what I believe. It was only a matter of time.' Load-Date: November 26, 2023  End of Document
