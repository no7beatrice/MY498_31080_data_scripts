   Brexit report unimpressive The Journal (Newcastle, UK) January 23, 2024 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 18 Length: 214 words Body   CAMBRIDGE Econometrics. An independent economic forecasting group of experts? Or a bunch of student scribblers all too keen to please their commissioning master? I've looked into the recent report on Brexit referred to by Peter Sagar (letters, January 17). I wasn't impressed. It was paid for by London Mayor Sadiq Kahn. You'll find some of the highlights at www.london.gov.uk. The numbers are enormous. We are all massively worse off because of Brexit and it's only going to get worse, so they say! Lots of computer modelling and predictions. With a mystifying absence of real world data. Calculating how the UK economy might have performed in a vacuum. It's nonsense from start to finish. Some of the most outlandish suggestions relate to employment data. Brexit has lost the UK 1.8 million jobs, including 290,000 in London alone. You have to wonder with the unemployment rate so low who would do these jobs? The whole report assumes that post-Brexit the performance of the UK economy has diverged from that of similar nations. So, what about it? France and Germany should, relatively speaking, be powering ahead of us. The inconvenient fact is that, however hard you look, there's zero evidence this is happening. Independent report or fake news? You decide. John Hodgkins, Seaton Sluice Load-Date: January 23, 2024  End of Document
