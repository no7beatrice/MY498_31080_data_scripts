   Labour’s VAT raid on private schools ‘not morally right’, insists Farage telegraph.co.uk May 30, 2024 Thursday 6:28 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:2 Length: 2700 words Byline: By Albert Tait Body   Nigel Farage has said that Labour’s planned VAT raid on private schools is “not morally right”. The honorary president of Reform UK said the plan would deprive young people of the chance to have “the best possible education”. Labour plans to impose 20pc VAT on private schools’ fees if it wins the general election to fund more teachers in the state sector. Speaking on BBC Question Time, Mr Farage said: “It’s not morally right to take away choice from parents and the opportunity for some young people to have the best possible education available. “If I was Labour, I would introduce more scholarships to go to some of these elite schools.” Mr Farage, who attended Dulwich College, a fee-paying private school, added: “Labour seem to love to destroy things that are successful and work well. “This will be a huge mistake if they do it. I hope they change their minds.” Labour’s plans have already sparked backlash, with private schools set to hike fees as they brace for the party’s tax raid. Defending the plan on the BBC show, Wes Streeting, Labour’s shadow health secretary, said private schools would have to make cuts. He said: “I know there’s lots of opposition from independent schools, who have pleaded poverty and say people will be priced out. “Independent school fees have risen beyond inflation every year since 2010. “I say to the headteachers, you’re going to have to cut your cloth accordingly like state schools have had to.” But Piers Morgan, another panellist, criticised Labour’s plan as “the politics of envy”. He said: “I think you should be apologetic. I think it is the worst kind of politics of envy. It is a war on aspiration... it shows a total lack of knowledge about the type of people who send their kids to schools like Epsom College. “I bet there are a lot of parents here who have scrimped and saved to give their kids the best chance in life, as my parents did when I went to a prep school and I went to a comprehensive after that.” Tory schools minister Damian Hinds and the Rt Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the bishop of Dover, also featured on the panel of the show, which was helmed by Fiona Bruce.

We’re pausing our live coverage of tonight’s BBC election debate on Question Time. Here are some of the key moments:                                             Wes Streeting, Labour’s shadow health secretary, criticised Rishi Sunak’s National Service plan, saying that “we owe the younger generation after they suffered during the Covid pandemic.                       A “big re-think” of the NHS is needed, said Nigel Farage, the honorary president of Reform UK, who called for a funding model similar to France                       Mr Farage called Labour’s planned VAT raid on private schools “morally wrong” while Mr Streeting defended the plan and called for fee-paying schools to make cuts.                                                              30 May 2024-08:28PM GMT                                         Private schools must make cuts, says Streeting                    Wes Streeting says private school headteachers must make cuts like state schools have done. “I know there’s lots of opposition from independent schools, who have pleaded poverty and say people will be priced out,” he says. “Independent school fees have risen beyond inflation every year since 2010.  “I say to the headteachers, you’re going to have to cut your cloth accordingly like state schools have had to.”                      30 May 2024-08:10PM GMT                                         Farage: Labour’s VAT raid would be a ‘mistake’                    On Labour’s plan for private schools, Mr Farage says: “Labour seem to love to destroy things that are successful and work well.  “This will be a huge mistake if they do it. I hope they change their minds,” adds Mr Farage, who attended Dulwich College, a fee-paying private school,  Piers Morgan, who is also critical of Labour’s VAT raid, says: “Do you know who got a bursary and went to a grammar school-Keir Starmer.”                      30 May 2024-08:05PM GMT                                         Morgan says Labour’s VAT raid is ‘politics of envy’                    Piers Morgan has described Labour’s plan for private schools as “the politics of envy”. He said: “I think you should be apologetic. I think it is the worst kind of politics of envy. It is a war on aspiration... it shows a total lack of knowledge about the type of people who send their kids to schools like Epsom College.  “I bet there are a lot of parents here who have scrimped and saved to give their kids the best chance in life, as my parents did when I went to a prep school and I went to a comprehensive after that.  “If you believe even half of the figures that have been projected as an impact of this... it’s the smaller independent schools, they are going to go bust, then hundreds of kids are going to need to go into the state school system and it’s going to swamp our system. “This is a politics of envy and Labour at its worst”.                      30 May 2024-08:00PM GMT                                         Labour’s VAT raid on private schools ‘not morally right’, says Farage                    Nigel Farage says Labour’s planned VAT raid on private schools is “not morally right”. He says: “It’s not morally right to take away choice from parents and the opportunity for some young people to have the best possible education available.  “If I was Labour, I would introduce more scholarships to go to some of these elite schools.”                      30 May 2024-07:56PM GMT                                         Farage denounces Habib comments                    Nigel Farage has denounced the language of the Reform deputy leader who said Britain should ‘absolutely’ let migrants drown in the English Channel. Ben Habib, the party’s Wellingborough parliamentary candidate, said asylum seekers should “suffer the consequences” of attempting to reach Britain in small boats.                      30 May 2024-07:52PM GMT                                         Piers Morgan urges Sunak to settle £1,000 Rwanda debt                    Piers Morgan has questioned why Rishi Sunak has not settled his £1,000 debt with him over the Rwanda policy.  The Prime Minister bet Mr Morgan £1,000 earlier this year that deportation flights to Rwanda would take off before the next election. “Why isn’t he paying it”, Mr Morgan asks Tory MP Damian Hinds, adding: “He’s richer than the King.”                      30 May 2024-07:46PM GMT                                         Farage says ‘Brexit powers’ can solve migration issue                    Asked about Brexit, Nigel Farage says: “Why did people vote for Brexit, there were lots of reasons get control of our lives was the main one, of which borders were the most important part.  “Labour opened the door (to migration) in the most incredible way. Under the Conservatives that has just accelerated. “The point about Brexit is it gives us total control about who can live in this country.” He adds that the UK needs to use its “Brexit powers” to solves the issue of migration, and says “big business has an addiction to migrant labour.”                      30 May 2024-07:37PM GMT                                         Streeting: ‘I would rather die in a ditch” than privatise NHS                    Wes Streeting says “I would rather die in a ditch” than see the NHS become privately funded. “People should never, ever have to worry about the bill,” he says.                      30 May 2024-07:35PM GMT                                         Farage: NHS ‘isn’t working anymore’                    Mr Farage says there needs to be a “bigger think” about how to fix the NHS and suggests a funding system similar to France. “It actually isn’t working anymore... we’ve increased what we’re spending on the NHS and we’re not getting the delivery.  “The French have a mutual system where those that can afford pay effectively into an insurance scheme, those that can’t afford it are covered, and they are getting a much better return.  “We need to fundamentally rethink how we fund the NHS” He adds: “Wes, you were really sounding quite radical six months ago about the NHS, but I think a bit less so now.”                      30 May 2024-07:30PM GMT                                         Morgan: Labour’s NHS plan ‘tinkering while Rome burns’                    Piers Morgan says Labour’s pledge on the NHS is “tinkering while Rome burns”. He says: “That pledge is tinkering while Rome burns. Given you’re shadow chancellor has just mimicked the Tories and ruled out tax raises, how the hell are you going to pay for this stuff.  “There will be no money”.                      30 May 2024-07:21PM GMT                                         Morgan vs Farage                    Nigel Farage and Piers Morgan have clashed for the first time in the programme. On why Mr Farage isn’t running in the election, Mr Morgan says:n “You’ve had all year to think about this election. You knew it was coming.” In response, Mr Farage says: ”I have a nightly TV show, yours has been shut down,. You’re a YouTuber.”                      30 May 2024-07:17PM GMT                                         Piers Morgan: ‘I like the idea of National Service’                    Asked about National Service, Piers Morgan says: “I rather like the idea, I’m not sure about the current plans for it-I don’t think it’s going to be very well thought through. “We are in a strange situation going on with younger people. There’s a kind of epidemic of anxiety, depression, suicide.  “It’s been exacerbated by the pandemic, and I think giving them something which gives them a regular sense of purpose. I think it would give them a sense of responsibility, purpose, and a sense of duty.”                      30 May 2024-07:13PM GMT                                         Streeting: ‘We owe the younger generation’                    Labour’s shadow health secretary Wes Streeting has said “we owe” the younger generation as he criticises the Conservative’s National Service scheme. Under the mandatory scheme, school leavers will have to either enrol on a 12-month military placement or spend one weekend each month volunteering in their community. Mr Streeting says: “This prime minister and the Tories are in no position whatsoever to lecture anyone else about service to the country and this generation of young people, who, I think the Prime Minister was implying was somehow feckless and in need of discipline.  “This is a generation of young people who’ve made more of a sacrifice than my generation and people around my age have ever made because it was their education, their wellbeing, their childhood that was sacrificed during the pandemic, for good reason.  “It was the first time in my lifetime in recent history, where we said to young people, you need to make sacrifices to protect us as adults. We owe this generation, in terms of their educational recovery, in terms of their education, and their well being and their mental health.”                      30 May 2024-06:47PM GMT                                         Farage’s 37th appearance on Question Time                    Nigel Farage will be making his 37th appearance on Question Time tonight  The episode is likely to feature some fiery clashes after comments on immigration from Mr Farage in recent days sparked heated discussion across the political divide. In a post on Twitter, he said he was “looking forward” to the episode, while Piers Morgan wrote: “Well, this should be fun. Haven’t seen Farage since the little weasel tried to stab me in the back with Trump.” That appeared to be a reference to claims he made in 2022 that Mr Farage had handed the former US president a three-page dossier of critical comments he had made about him just before the ex-Britain’s Got Talent judge was due to interview him. At the time, Mr Farage said he had told Trump “if you do this interview, here is the truth,” before handing him the dossier, claiming that “the interview, because of that, wasn’t quite the friendliest it ever could have been”.                      30 May 2024-06:44PM GMT                                         I am victim of ‘systematic campaign’ of bullying, says Shaheen                    Faiza Shaheen, who has been blocked from standing for Labour at the election, says she has been a victim of a “systematic campaign” of bullying by the party. Ms Shaheen has been blocked from standing as Labour’s candidate in the north-east London constituency of Chingford and Woodford Green. It comes after she allegedly liked a series of social media posts that downplayed anti-Semitism accusations. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, she said: “Today I have been meeting with my campaign and legal teams to discuss my next steps. This is not the end of my story and I will be releasing all the detail of what has happened to me publicly.” She claimed it was the “end of a systematic campaign of racism, Islamophobia and bullying from some within the party” and that she had never experienced such “relentless hostility”.

Ms Abbott claims she has been barred from standing for Labour as MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, something which Sir Keir Starmer has denied. She claims she is a victim of a “cull” of the Left-wing which has also seen Faiza Shaheen and Lloyd Russell-Moyle barred from standing at the election. Mr Streeting said on Wednesday that he was “not particularly” comfortable with the treatment of Abbott in a direct challenge to the Labour leader. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, hasalso supported Ms Abbott , piling further pressure on Sir Keir over his treatment of the Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP. The issue is likely to be raised at Question Time tonight.                      30 May 2024-06:19PM GMT                                         Farage busy on eighth day of election campaign                    Nigel Farage is appearing on the Question Time panel after delivering a speech at a Reform UK press conference earlier today.  Speaking on the eighth day of the election campaign, Mr Farage said that the “election is over” and that Reform will be the main opposition to a Labour government. He also downplayed any suggestions of a split between him and Reform leader Richard Tice, and ruled out any future deal with the Conservative Party.                      30 May 2024-06:12PM GMT                                         Welcome to our live coverage                    Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the BBC general election debate on Question Time tonight.
