   Only 10% of Britons believe Brexit was positive for the U.K. CE Noticias Financieras English December 30, 2023 Saturday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

The study published by "The Observer" highlights that 35% of the British believe that the Brexit had a negative impact on their personal finances, reports the DPA agency. 55% believe it was negative for the country's economy in general (versus only 12% who believe it was favorable) and 48% believe it was negative for the public health system (versus 9% who believe it was positive). With more than 2,000 interviews conducted, the Opinium study also highlights that 31% believe Brexit was negative for the environment (12% believe it was good) and 40% consider it detrimental for wages (11% believe it was positive). 52% believe it was bad for the UK's ability to control immigration, one of the star arguments of the Brexit campaign, and 63% believe it was bad for the cost of living (7% believe it was good). The Brexit campaign argued that it would be a revival for the economy and trade, and that it would recover £350,000 a week for the National Health System (NHS); in addition to immigration and border control. "Discontent about how the Government has managed Brexit continues with perceived failures even in areas previously seen as potentially beneficial," explained Opinium's head of policy and public affairs, James Crouch, referring to immigration. "Despite all this, Brexit is likely to be a secondary issue at the next election in the face of the state of the economy and the NHS, a clear priority for voters," he added.
