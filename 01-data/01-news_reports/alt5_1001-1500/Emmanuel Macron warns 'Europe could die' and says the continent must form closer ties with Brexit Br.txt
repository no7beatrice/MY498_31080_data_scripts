With just three years left of his second and final term in office, the French president, 46, wants to show his critics that he retains the energy and fresh thinking that helped propel him into the presidency in 2017. 'There is a risk our Europe could die. We are not equipped to face the risks,' Macron said in his speech at the Sorbonne University in Paris, warning that military, economic and other pressures could weaken and fragment the 27-nation EU. Macron said Russia must not be allowed to win in Ukraine, and he called for a boost in Europe's cybersecurity capacity, closer defence ties with post-Brexit Britain, and the creation of a European academy to train high-ranking military personnel. Europe 'must show that it is never a vassal of the United States and that it also knows how to talk to all the other regions of the world', he said, urging to adopt a 'credible' defence strategy less dependent on the US.  Macron described Russia's behaviour after its invasion of Ukraine as 'uninhibited' and said it was no longer clear where Moscow's 'limits' lay. 'Our Europe, today, is mortal and it can die. It can die and this depends only on our choices,' Macron said, warning that Europe was 'not armed against the risks we face' in a world where the 'rules of the game have changed'. 'Over the next decade... the risk is immense of (Europe) being weakened or even relegated,' he added, also pointing to the risk of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. 'There is no defence without a defence industry ... we've had decades of under-investment,' he said, adding that Europeans should give preference to buying European military equipment.

He urged Europe to be more a master of its own destiny, saying in the past it was over-dependent on Russia for energy and Washington for security. He said the indispensable 'sine qua non' for European security was 'that Russia does not win the war of aggression in Ukraine'. Macron also called for a 'revision' of EU trade policy to defend European interests, accusing both China and the United States of no longer respecting the rules of global commerce. 'It cannot work if we are the only ones in the world to respect the rules of trade - as they were written up 15 years ago - if the Chinese and the Americans no longer respect them by subsidising critical sectors.' Macron has long called for European 'strategic autonomy' involving less reliance on the United States, a stance that has gained greater resonance in the face of Donald Trump's renewed bid for the White House.  Trump has often accused Europe of free loading on defence at the United States' expense. However, many EU officials believe there is currently no credible alternative to the US military umbrella, and some suspect Macron of pushing French industrial interests. Macron said Europe also risks falling behind economically in a context where global free-trade rules are being challenged by major competitors, and he said it should aim to become a global leader in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, space, biotechnologies and renewable energy. The EU should agree exemptions to its own competition rules so it can support firms in sectors such as AI and green energy in the face of 'oversubsidies' by the United States and China, Macron said. Europe needs less fragmented markets for energy, telecoms and financial services, and must also cut red tape, he added. The French leader hopes his speech will have the same impact as a similar address at the Sorbonne he made seven years ago that prefigured some significant EU policy shifts. Since then, much has changed, with major geopolitical challenges including the war in Gaza, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and growing China-US tensions.

The agenda is due to be decided after the European elections, when EU leaders will haggle over the bloc's top jobs. Macron returned to the same themes of a speech he gave in September 2017 months after taking office at the same location - the Sorbonne University in Paris - but in a context that seven years on has been turned upside down by Brexit, Covid and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Macron is, after Brexit and the departure from power of German chancellor Angela Merkel, often seen by commentators as Europe's number one leader. But his party is facing embarrassment in June's European elections, ranking well behind the far-right in opinion polls and even risking coming third behind the Socialists. The head of the governing party's list for the elections, the little-known Valerie Hayer, is failing to make an impact, especially in the face of the high-profile 28-year-old Jordan Bardella leading the far right and Raphael Glucksmann emerging as a new star on the left. Macron made no reference to the elections in his speech, even though analysts say he is clearly seeking to wade into the campaign, with his speech reading as a manifesto for the continent's future. 'The risk is that Europe will experience a decline and we are already starting to see this despite all our efforts,' he warned. 'We are still too slow and not ambitious enough,' he added, urging a 'powerful Europe', which 'is respected', 'ensures its security' and regains 'its strategic autonomy'.
