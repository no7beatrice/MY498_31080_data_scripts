   UK companies trading with the EU report lower profits after Brexit CE Noticias Financieras English January 30, 2024 Tuesday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC.

In the survey of 1,001 heads of British companies with international trade, commissioned by tax technology consultancy Avalara, 70% of those who voted in favor of Brexit and 79% of those who voted against it said their businesses are now "less profitable". 73% and 84%, respectively, subscribed that "the UK has not experienced the business boom that the Brexit boosters promised." In addition, four out of five respondents - 81% - acknowledged that, following the exit from the European Union, there was increased difficulty in doing business with European business groups. They also reported an increase in costs due to new regulatory and customs obligations of an average of £96,281 (just over (EURO)112,500) over the past three years. Vice president of global indirect tax at Avalara, the company that commissioned the survey from Censuswide, Alex Baulf, told the FT that they expected damage to British companies with overseas trades following Brexit. "Where there is trade, there are additional costs that eat into profit margins," he said. The publication of this data coincides with the eve of the entry into force of the UK's new border controls on food and animal products imported from the European Union and which, from Wednesday, will require phytosanitary certificates.
