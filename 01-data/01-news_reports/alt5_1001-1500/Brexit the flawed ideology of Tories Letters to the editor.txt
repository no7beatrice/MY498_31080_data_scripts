   Brexit the flawed ideology of Tories; Letters to the editor The Press and Journal February 6, 2024 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Aberdeen Journals Ltd All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 30 Length: 260 words Body   Sir, - The indomitable, albeit misguided, George Emslie unleashes another anti-EU diatribe (Letters, January 31). His yearning for the nativist purity of Brexit is palpable, his words screaming off the page. How dare Remainers stymie the flourishing of something so fine? How dare Johnny Foreigner steal our jobs? His passion lacks intellectual heft. This is unsurprising given that Brexit is a flawed ideology with no specified objective other than leaving the EU. Neither is the UK the idyll he believes it to be. Transparency International recently found that Britain, once the world's eighth most transparent country, had fallen to 20th and considered more corrupt than Uruguay. This may prompt Mr Emslie to revise his claim that the EU is "dodgy". Our economy has a structural dependence on immigration, so why the fuss? Sir John Curtice explained this is because the purpose of Brexit was to reduce immigration, and it's proved "spectacularly unsuccessful". An example of Tory obfuscation and distraction. Mr Emslie accuses the EU of "gleefully doing nothing to stop" the boats, ignoring the fact France offered to open a processing centre there. He should also note that both France and Germany take more asylum seekers than Britain. Is it any wonder that there is a clear majority of the electorate who believe that Brexit was bad for Britain? Mr Emslie, it's time to set aside your Brexiteer hubris and stop your "dodgy" and "toxic" blethering. Raise your game by proffering an opinion replete with supporting evidence. Credibility beckons!
