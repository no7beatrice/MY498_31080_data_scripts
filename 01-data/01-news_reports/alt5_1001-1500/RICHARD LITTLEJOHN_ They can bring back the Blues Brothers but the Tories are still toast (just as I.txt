   RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: They can bring back the Blues Brothers but the Tories are still toast (just as I told you) MailOnline March 14, 2024 Thursday 5:18 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: DEBATE; Version:2 Length: 1302 words Byline: Richard Littlejohn for the Daily Mail Body   My dear friend Colin 'The Animal' Adamson - one of Fleet Street's Finest - told me after I Ieft London's Evening Standard and joined Kelvin MacKenzie's Super Soaraway Sun: 'You're the first Green journalist. You keep recycling your old columns.' To which, I pled 'guilty'. If you can't quote yourself... That was a lifetime ago. I've been here, my spiritual home, for the past 30-odd years, on and off, and counting. But The Animal wasn't wrong. I'm still at it. For instance, in the first week of January this year, the headline on this column was: 'Here's an idea . . . maybe the Tories should stand down in favour of Reform UK.' The intro, as we say in the trade, read: 'Where is it written that the Conservative Party has a divine right to rule? Or that Tory MPs are entitled to hold on to their seats, simply because the Labour alternative is too horrible to contemplate?' I went on: 'An allegedly Conservative Government has delivered the highest taxes in 70 years, a huge increase in legal and illegal immigration, five million people economically inactive, and a strike-ridden public sector where nothing works properly and civil servants don't even turn up to the office more than three days a week. 'So Reform's low-tax, anti-woke manifesto, coupled with a pledge to slash immigration and scrap the net zero nonsense, is attractive to small-c conservative-inclined voters - even though under our current electoral system the party has no chance of forming a government.' Curiously, that same week Lee Anderson, then Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party, dismissed Reform's leader Richard Tice as a 'pound shop Farage'. On Monday, with great ceremony, Anderson defected to Reform. Call it 99p for cash. Anderson had the Tory whip withdrawn for his injudicious remarks about London's two-bob chancer of a mayor Genghis Khan being controlled by Islamists. I said at the time that Leapy Lee was well wide of the mark. Genghis is a woke-ish opportunist, interested only in filling his own boots, not an Islamist. But what this knee-jerk suspension of the whip did demonstrate was that the modern Tory party is more in thrall to the self-styled metropolitan 'elite' than to the millions who handed them an 80-seat majority in 2019. Be honest, the game's up. The Conservatives have betrayed not just the millions who put them into office, but also the 17.4 million who voted for Brexit in 2016. As the late-great Terry-Thomas remarked in I'm All Right, Jack: They're an absolute shower! So Anderson's defection is to be welcomed. He may not be the sharpest shovel in the coal mine, but . . . what's that line about sinners and repenting? The other members of the so-called 'Red Wall' Tory MPs should join him today. They've been royally shafted by the Home Counties Conservatives, still panting for Brussels and a sympathetic hearing on the BBC and far-Left Sky News, now twinned with Black Lives Matter and The Guardian. Reform may get six million votes and not a single seat, but what the heck? We can't go on like this, Virginia, can ya? This column has never gone in for party politics, apart from backing the Brexit Party in 2019. So forgive me for quoting myself again: 'Something remarkable is happening. From the North East of England to the South West, people who have never taken much of an interest in politics are flocking to Brexit Party rallies. They've had enough of being patronised, of being dismissed as thick racists who are too stupid to know what they are voting for.  They are throwing their support behind sincere men and women from all walks of life and backgrounds who have put their careers and families on hold to take on the political Establishment. 'My friend Robert Rowland is a 50-something father-of-four, ex-RAF, who made a few bob in finance. He has never played an active role in politics before. But he subscribes to the philosophy of Edmund Burke: All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. Robert decided it was time to stand up and be counted. 'So have countless other good men and women, who put themselves forward as Brexit Party candidates. They have an extensive range of real-life experience, utterly divorced from the narrowly drawn ranks of the careerist mediocrities who inhabit the Westminster bubble. 'The Brexit Party slate is far more diverse than any of the grim indentikit clones on offer from the Lib Dems, Tories, or Labour. They are free from the stench of institutionalised decay and entitlement, which clings to the other parties like a cheap suit - No Change UK, included. 'As this column has consistently maintained, this is about much more than Britain's relationship with the EU. If the political class gets away with stopping Brexit, or watering it down to the point where it is meaningless, we will have ceased to be a proper, functioning democracy.

PM insists Tories are 'united' despite claims Cabinet ministers are 'preparing for disaster' and MPs 'openly plotting' amid anger at donor race row                                         'Sorry, but I don't buy the argument that voting Brexit will let in Corbyn. Labour is thoroughly discredited, too, and has as much to lose at this election as the Tories. And, anyway, what kind of a pitch is: vote for us because we're not as rubbish as the other lot? 'As Mrs Thatcher said in 1979, people should vote Conservative because they can do better than Labour - not because they couldn't do any worse. 'Maybe a Brexit Party landslide will lead to a long-overdue political realignment and usher in a new breed, like my mate Robert Rowland, who actually have confidence in Britain's future outside the sclerotic, corrupt, crumbling EU edifice. 'This election is only taking place because of the abject, deliberate failure of the political class to respect the democratic will of the British people, in the biggest vote for anything, ever. But it affords us a heaven-sent opportunity to tell the out-of-touch Westminster rabble and their hangers-on where to get off.' My friend Robert Rowland died in a tragic boating accident a couple of years ago, but our mutual friend Rupert Lowe went from 0-60 faster than a Tesla as a Reform candidate in a recent by-election. Whether Nigel Farage - another old mate - makes a comeback or not is entirely a matter for him. I wouldn't blame him if he sat out the next election. Too much fun, and money, to be had on the telly and as part of Donald Trump's Flying Circus this year. The Tories' latest pitch is the same as 2019, except that this time round it's not Corbyn they're trying to scare us with it's the third-rate, Islingtonian yuman rites lawyer Starmer. Have you noticed that Starmer's started moving his 'roots' from stockbroker-belt Guildford, in Surrey - where his dad owned the company and he went to a fee-paying grammar school - to more hairy-arsed Kent, the up-market bit of Sarf-Lund'n? By the time of the election he'll have reinvented himself as one of the Brink's-Mat mob. Frankly, is Starmer any worse than the careerist loser Dishy Rishi or Manchurian Candidate Colin Hunt, from the Fast Show, currently masquerading as Chancellor? And anyway, after the election Labour will probably stage a Red Ken-style coup and install that gormless fishwife Ange Rayner as PM. This week we're told that Boris and Call Me Dave are going to be wheeled out - a kind of Jake and Elwood tribute act, The Blues Brothers (Bullingdon Club) Band. They'd get the same reception as Jake and Elwood at Bob's Country Bunker - stuck behind chicken wire as the audience throws bottles at them. Rawhide! Nope, the only hope is a complete political realignment. Time for the Red Wall Tories to jump ship and join Reform. But, what do I know? As Kermit said: It's not easy being Green.
