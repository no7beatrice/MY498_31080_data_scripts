   EU woos Labour with freedom of movement deal telegraph.co.uk April 18, 2024 Thursday 2:45 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:6 Length: 757 words Byline: By Joe Barnes, BRUSSELS CORRESPONDENT Highlight: Europeans aged 18 to 30 would be able to work, travel and study in UK and vice versa Body   The European Union has proposed a freedom of movement-style deal for young Europeans to appeal to a future Labour government.  The youth mobility scheme would allow Europeans aged 18 to 30 to come to Britain for up to four years to work, travel and study. It could pave the way for thousands of European waiters, baristas and au pairs to plug gaps in the British workforce.  Britons would also be able to take part in the reciprocal scheme by moving to the continent under the deal, proposed by the European Commission  on Thursday. Maros Sefcovic, the EU’s Brexit negotiator , said: “The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union has hit young people in the EU and the UK who would like to study, work and live abroad particularly hard. “Today, we take the first step towards an ambitious but realistic agreement between the EU and the UK that would fix this issue. Our aim is to rebuild human bridges between young Europeans on both sides of the Channel.” The offer would probably appeal to Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, who has signalled that he would seek closer ties with the EU  if his party wins the election.                      Youth mobility schemes                    The Home Office has also engaged in discussions with some EU countries  after being asked by Rishi Sunak’s Downing Street to agree more youth mobility schemes. The UK already has reciprocal schemes with 10 non-EU countries including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan and Iceland. They allow those eligible to travel and work in Britain without needing a sponsor or meeting other requirements, such as salary thresholds, without significantly contributing to net migration. The European Commission said it was making the offer of an EU-wide deal because the UK had already spoken with a number of member states to discuss youth mobility. If a deal is reached, it would be Brussels’ first youth mobility treaty with a third country. Under the bloc’s offer, Britain would have to agree to equal treatment on tuition and visa fees, and healthcare surcharges. In an online Q&A of its proposals, the EU makes it clear that the scheme would not replace existing paths to obtaining visas and that either side would have the ability to reject applications because of threats to public security and health. It is unlikely that negotiations will get under way immediately, with the EU’s 27 member states still required to agree on the Commission’s proposal. The forthcoming European Parliament elections and general election  are also likely to act as stumbling blocks to the talks beginning.                      ‘Failed Brexit project’                    Industry leaders and Remain campaigners have been pushing for an EU-wide visa scheme to make it easier for young Britons to travel and work in the bloc, and vice-versa. “This landmark intervention is a welcome acknowledgement of the immense impact that Brexit has had, not only on young Brits but young Europeans as well,” Naomi Smith, the chief executive of Best for Britain, said of the EU offer. “The UK Government must now respond in kind. “Until a reciprocal EU-UK youth mobility scheme is formalised, our young people will continue to be robbed of the irreplaceable formative experiences their parents and older siblings enjoyed, because of a failed Brexit project  they did not vote for.” Charles Owen, of Seasonal Business in Travel, said: “A reciprocal youth mobility scheme is a win-win for both Europe and the UK, and in particular for struggling businesses suffering from chronic labour shortages, made worse by Brexit. “Momentum is building to get this deal done and we implore the prime minister to talk to Industry and prepare for the upcoming negotiations appropriately. This is a serious economic and cultural opportunity for all.” A Labour spokesperson said: “This is a proposal from the EU Commission to EU member states, not to the UK. It has come about because the UK government is reportedly approaching other European countries to try to establish mobility arrangements. “Labour has no plans for a youth mobility scheme. We have already suggested some tangible ways that we would look to improve the relationship and deliver for British businesses and consumers, including seeking a veterinary agreement to tackle trade barriers, mutual recognition of professional qualifications and improved touring opportunities for artists. “A Labour Government would seek to improve the UK’s working relationship with the EU within our red lines-no return to the single market, customs union or free movement.” Load-Date: April 18, 2024  End of Document
