   No more Brexit; Letters East Anglian Daily Times December 14, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 26 Length: 265 words Body   IF I could wish never to hear one word again it would be 'Brexit'. It is used and mis-used so often it has become meaningless. Mostly it is fodder for lazy blaming of anything that goes wrong. But, worse than that, it continues the hard line habit of dividing people to the extreme ends of an argument. An academic study published this week found that people with 'lower cognitive ability' were more likely to vote Leave in the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership. (For transparency I should say that I score highly in such tests as they very often include a section on identifying breeds of dogs.) It claims to be a serious piece of work by two economists from the University of Bath. There is nothing new about research in the field of voting behaviour and nothing new in its failure to predict the future. Part of this study was to explore how couples vote. The conclusion? Unsurprisingly, most couples voted the same and, where there was a difference, the person with the lowest cognitive score voted Leave. The 17.4m people who voted for Brexit cannot be dismissed as idiots. But vote for Brexit they did. It happened. Now is not the time to divide our already divided country any further or to gloat at EU countries whose economies are faring even worse than our own. The government, of whatever colour, must make Brexit work. Stop focussing on blame, name calling and dissent but put division behind us. There's a lot of work to be done; education, poverty, health, housing, environment - as well as building working bridges with www.Europe.No more 'Brexit' please. LESLEY BRAIN, Holton.
