   Express visas after Brexit exacerbate labor exploitation in the United Kingdom CE Noticias Financieras English April 4, 2024 Thursday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC.

New agricultural and care work permits are leaving workers particularly vulnerable, according to academic research and the UK Home Office's own reports. Brexit limbo: more than 5,700 Spaniards risk expulsion from the UK as they wait for their status to be resolved          Unclear conditions, abuse of intermediaries and lack of sufficient vigilance by the authorities is the pattern found by a recently published research which has also identified some extreme cases of exploitation and even what could be described as slavery for lack of food, excessive hours, racist insults and other reported abuses.          Express visas created initially as a pilot program in 2019 are now routinely used to hire seasonal workers and health care employees responsible for the care of adults in the public health system or in private homes and residences for a few months. Tens of thousands of people are working in this way in the UK, tied to a particular employer and unable to switch easily, as EU workers who previously filled these jobs without visas because the UK was part of the single market did. These visas are often dependent on intermediaries, who in some cases are imposing undue conditions.          "What happens is that workers end up paying recruitment fees in their home country, and that's not particularly well policed. Once they get to the U.K. and they're told that recruitment fees are illegal, then it's too late, they've already paid. Often they also cover it up themselves because they don't know if they will be adversely affected by the fact that they have already paid," Inga Thiemann, a law professor at the University of Leicester who specializes in labor rights and who has led academic research on these visas with the participation of NGOs, explains to elDiario.es. The amounts paid in Indonesia, for example, range between 2,300 and 4,600 euros, according to the testimonies collected by the investigation, which in some cases included airline tickets.      Indebted workers          Often, the intermediaries or employers excuse themselves on the grounds that they are not cheating, but suggesting "the best scenario" possible in a highly variable sector such as, in particular, the agricultural sector. The promise is that they will work for six months and on renewable contracts for up to two years about 40 hours a week, but the reality they encounter is that the visa takes a long time to arrive, the weeks they can work and get paid are reduced, and, depending on when they arrive in the season, perhaps the farms no longer need as much labor.          "They find themselves working 20 hours instead of 40, and three or four months instead of six. They figure out a certain amount of money and to be able to pay off debt for flights, training, fees, and they find they have to borrow money themselves," explains Thiemann, who based his research on interviews with workers from countries outside the European Union.          One employee from Indonesia, for example, explained that he had to work three and a half months full time to pay off his debts and three others explained that, after six months of meager work in the UK, they had not been able to pay back the money.       Hypervulnerability          The "hypervulnerability" situation is for everyone on these visas, including EU citizens, who may lose their status like everyone else or, in some cases, find themselves awaiting post-Brexit paperwork. But some factors that make conditions more difficult for these workers and their scope to change jobs or complain touch those outside the EU more because of remoteness, lack of connections and the cost of returning home.          Half of the workers employed in the agricultural sector came from Ukraine before the Russian invasion in 2022, and after that they have come mainly from Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and, until the suspension of an agreement, Indonesia.          Exploitation in the countryside or in the care sector predates Brexit and also affected EU workers, despite then having more residency and work rights. "Just because people had more rights, it didn't always mean they could make full use of those rights, because there is a difference between having a right in theory and being able to take your employer to court," explains Professor Thiemann. "Was it always better for everyone? No. But are these workers at greater risk because they are also incurring debts for travel and visa fees that EU workers obviously didn't have? Yes." Many of the farmworkers she and her team spoke to were from Indonesia, and their background increases the risk: "Obviously airfare alone can be a major factor for workers. And it's much easier to say you don't agree with these working conditions and go home if going home means taking the ferry and then the bus rather than a long-haul flight that will cost 500 euros."       "Modern slavery"          The care and health sector, before Brexit a common destination for Spanish workers, is now turning to recruiting in the Philippines and several African countries, particularly Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Congo and Zimbabwe. Efforts have not solved the problem in a sector that is estimated to be short of 152,000 workers, according to the latest data from 2023.          In the case of care workers, one of the most recurring issues is confusion over the type of visa and the conditions and guarantees attached to each. The professor recounts that she encountered workers who had regular hours and adequate pay, but also people who could be considered "victims of modern slavery, paid next to nothing and working excessive hours."          In this sector, the research identified cases of extreme exploitation and possible modern slavery that were reported to the national relief mechanism. For example, one of the interviewees, from the Philippines, was a woman who reported that she worked without rest, with hardly any food and without being paid what was agreed upon. She also claimed that her employer and her son insulted and mistreated her, and that she was told that the Filipinos were "part of a criminal organization" so that she would talk to others in the community who could help her.          Another woman, who was originally on a student visa, began working in a house and was paid below minimum wage in addition to having to pay for food and lodging and work excessive hours.       Scam agencies          In agriculture, there are a small number of agencies that can place these workers on farms, and only a fraction of them are monitored. But in the care sector, there is no organized scheme, meaning any nursing home or agency in this sector can sponsor a visa to recruit workers. "It's obviously much more opaque," Thiemann explains.          In fact, a Home Office investigation itself uncovered supposed agencies specializing in care services that had websites with information copied from one to another, no track record in the sector and few references as to whether they actually did any work beyond sponsoring visas.          At least 268 companies that never went through an inspection to certify their quality or existence obtained licenses and others operated without even registering anywhere. In one case, the Interior Ministry discovered that it had granted 1,234 certificates for visa sponsorship requested by a company that had only four employees and apparently no capacity to offer contracts. On another occasion, a company obtained 275 certificates using false information.          "I don't think anyone really knows what happened to these workers. There are problems of lack of transparency. And one of the key ones is that workers don't know which other employers they can go to because there is no list of employers who sponsor foreign workers," explains the University of Leicester professor. "Also, exit fees are legal in the care sector. If an employer has already spent money on training or recruitment and a worker leaves early, they can ask the worker to pay some of that money back. There is guidance on how these fees should be calculated, but there is no fixed legislation."          The government said in a statement following the report's publication that some agencies in the sector "or disguised as such" have "abused" the system in place for care visas and that the Home Office has already identified these sanctionable practices and will go "further" if necessary.
