   Bad Brexit   Irish Examiner January 2, 2024 Tuesday  Copyright 2024 Landmark Digital Media Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: OPINION; Change Of Mind; Pg. 10 Length: 236 words Body   Seven and a half years on from Britain's momentous decision to leave the European Union and three years after it finally left the single market and customs union, it appears the people of the country now realise Brexit was bad for them. In a survey of 2,000 Britons carried out last week, a clear majority now believe Brexit was bad for the British economy, has driven up prices, and actually hampered government attempts to control spiralling immigration. Some 35% of those polled say Brexit has been bad for their personal finances, while 47% say it has had a detrimental effect on the National Health Service (NHS), and 63% feel it has fuelled inflation and the cost-of-living crisis. With just 22% saying they believe it was good for the country in general, a vast majority now believe Brexit was a complete failure. With the Tory government struggling to maintain anything akin to across-the-board popularity and fighting rearguard actions on immigration, the state of the NHS, and the economy - and looking very vulnerable as an election approaches at some point this year - the survey is further bad news. At this remove, it would be churlish to suggest that the British people were adequately warned about the consequences of a 'Yes' vote to leave the EU, it is nonetheless evident that they are finally reaching their own conclusions about the pup they were sold by Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, and their cohorts.
