   Letters: London’s Jewish community deserves better from the Met police telegraph.co.uk April 23, 2024 Tuesday 12:01 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: OPINION; Version:1 Length: 1809 words Byline: By Letters to the Editor Highlight: Plus: Cut off in the countryside; Brexit disarray; Churchill’s portrait; overhauling the state pension; and swashbuckling batsmen Body   SIR – I cried when I read of the police officer threatening to arrest Gideon Falter, chief executive of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, for being “openly Jewish” and walking in central London during a pro-Palestinian protest the weekend before last (Letters, April 22 ). I never imagined that such a thing could happen in Britain in my lifetime. My parents lived through the Second World War and fought against anti-Semitism. The Metropolitan Police force needs to take a long, hard look at itself. Jane JonesLondon NW5 SIR – Police siding with protesters rather than law-abiding bystanders is nothing new. Some time after the EU referendum, on my way from the Ritz to clubland, I encountered a large and noisy anti-Brexit march going down St James’s. I began to tell the participants as loudly as I could – though in perfectly proper language – that they should respect the democratic decision of the British people. A uniformed constable came over to me and told me to shut up immediately, adding that I would be in very serious trouble if I did not. Fearing arrest, I was silent. But I have not trusted the police since.Francis BownLondon E3 SIR – The Metropolitan Police faces a difficult, wearying and increasingly costly task in trying to keep the peace at these interminable demonstrations. The potential for confrontation is obvious.Had Mr Falter not been warned of the likely outcome of his proposed actions and violence had occurred, that might have been reason to challenge the effectiveness of the policing. However, one officer’s clumsy choice of words in a charged and stressful situation is neither evidence of anti-Semitism nor a reason to call for the Met Commissioner’s dismissal.Roy RammGreat Dunmow, Essex SIR – As a Jew, I am given to wondering why the police are being blamed for the craven appeasement by politicians of the aggression and hatred displayed by some pro-Palestinian protesters.Michael GrayeffEdgware, Middlesex SIR – As it happens, I was at the pro-Palestinian demonstration in central London on April 13. (I would describe myself as a curious observer, however, rather than a participant.) As I watched the noisy, disparate crowds file by along Holborn, I noticed a group of Jewish socialists taking part. Given their participation, the police suggestion that being “openly Jewish” could be some kind of provocation appears even more bizarre.Richard HarrisonRichmond, Surrey                      Rural notspots                    SIR – Here in Northumberland our communication options are shrinking as digital services struggle to deliver as promised (“Rural areas ‘cut off’ as networks replace 3G”, report, April 22 ).My old-fashioned landline has stopped working and BT is taking a long time to fix it, presumably while it waits for the digital switchover. There is a sniff of mobile signal from both O2 and Vodafone, but it’s not enough to count. Our satellite broadband is adequate when it’s not raining heavily or blowing a gale, but the latency is too poor to allow video calls at any time. Streaming services are variable.Thankfully my FM radio still gets Radio 4 on one side of the house, but my DAB radio only works outside. When FM goes, so will Radio 4.Does any political party care about country dwellers? It doesn’t feel like it.Henry DoddsWhittingham, Northumberland                      Defining disability                    SIR – No assessment to determine a person’s eligibility for benefits (Letters, April 22 ) will work until there is a more nuanced way of looking at “disability”.The autistic spectrum, for instance, covers everything from manageable social interaction problems to profound non-communication and withdrawal. “Disabled” can cover everything from minor sensory problems to paralysis from the neck down and total dependence, while “mental illness” can range from life reaction to profound incapacitation.Many within each group can and do work – and many more would with the right support – but neither side comes out well if headlines imply that everyone needs the same allowances and payments when they don’t.Joyce WotherspoonMorpeth, Northumberland                      Churchill’s portrait                     SIR – Graham Sutherland’s preliminary work for his controversial portrait of Churchill possesses all the qualities which made this great artist so famous (“Draft portrait destroyed by Churchill on sale for £800k”, report, April 17 ). The finished portrait was later carefully recreated by a naturalised Englishman, Albrecht von Leyden MBE (1905-94), who had a huge admiration for both the painter and his subject. He felt strongly that the portrait ought not to be lost for ever. Using Sutherland’s various preparatory sketches and detailed notes provided by his widow, von Leyden painted a faithful copy in 1981. He explained that his aim was above all to capture Churchill’s “defiance, resolution and contempt [for Hitler], which I felt sure had been the purpose of Graham Sutherland.” This picture, so painstakingly done, was presented to the Carlton Club in 1991, where it remains. Churchill’s daughter, Lady Soames, came to see it and agreed that the club should “act as its guardian”.Lord Lexden (Con)London SW1                      Glide to the finish                    SIR – What a wonderful obituary (April 17 ) of Captain Eric Moody. I was interested to read that he learnt to fly a glider before he could drive a car. This clearly equipped him for the incident in which all four engines of BA 747-200 (registration G-BDXH) failed him. It was only through the skill of Moody and his crew that the lives of all onboard were saved, and the flight entered the Guinness Book of Records as the longest glide in a non-purpose-built plane. G-BDXH was later referred to as “the Galunggung Glider”.Geoff PringleLong Sutton, Somerset                      Tories’ Brexit disarray                    SIR – David Frost, a former Brexit negotiator, and Robert Jenrick, a former immigration minister, state: “We must get Brexit back on track or our biggest achievement will unravel” (Commentary, April 22 ).With so many Conservative MPs still fighting against our departure from the EU, how do Mr Jenrick and Lord Frost propose this will happen without widespread deselections before the general election?I have long felt that coalition governments lead to a block on legislative progress. Here we have an example of how even a single party, when it becomes too broad a church, risks ending its life scrapping like a weak coalition.A substantial majority means nowt when a party’s main policies cause such irreconcilable differences. Brexit should mean Brexit. It cannot be watered down.Phillipa DobsonBirmingham SIR – I recently considered rejoining the Labour Party, but won’t now.I thought one of Labour’s stated aims was to reset our relationship with Europe and, in so doing, make amends for the damage done to young people while improving our economic outlook. The recent offer from the EU to give freedom of movement to 18-30-year-olds was enormously exciting and appeared to be the beginning of a thaw in our relationship. Not surprisingly, the Conservative Party was not interested.The fact that Labour has followed suit is a betrayal. It too has closed down opportunities for young people – cynically, it seems, for reasons of political expedience.As a parent and grandparent I feel despair at the gratuitous damage being inflicted on the younger generation.I cannot vote for a party that puts political calculations ahead of decency.Jane HassidLondon NW1                       The acid Test                    SIR – I, too, vividly remember watching the climax to the Oval Test match in 1968, and Majorie Fagg’s memory (Letters, April 19 ) is not playing games with her.Encapsulated in the famous photograph of Derek Underwood taking the last wicket with minutes to spare, which shows all 11 of England’s players, it was also the only Test match in which those two swashbuckling batsmen Ted Dexter and Colin Milburn played together.Malcolm WatsonRyde, Isle of Wight                      Birds with a fondness for home comforts                     SIR – My brother and I rescued a barely fledged jackdaw (Letters, April 20 ), which we raised. It was very tame and would sit on my mother’s shoulder when she was digging in the garden and take any exposed worms. Despite our pleadings, my father decided it should be released into the wild, and took it by car to woodland some miles away. It beat him home by about 15 minutes.Nick PopeWoodcote, Oxfordshire  SIR – Magpies do indeed act like grey squirrels (Letters, April 18 ): at this time of the year they raid birds’ nests to eat the eggs or the young nestlings. They do not, however, damage trees or kill red squirrels.Brian ThompsonTarporley, Cheshire SIR – It is common for corvids to behave like squirrels when storing food. Jays plant many an oak tree by not returning to all the acorns they have buried. What puzzles me more is why a grey squirrel has taken to carrying off small round decorative stones from my garden. The animal will go hungry over winter if it thinks they are nuts it is storing.Adrian WallerWoodsetts, South Yorkshire                      Scrap the state pension for higher earners                     SIR – Nearly 13 million people draw the state pension in the UK (Comment, April 21 ). Many key public services are in dire need of investment, and yet, in its infinite wisdom, the Government has maintained its triple-lock protection for this benefit (not a right), which costs the taxpayer billions and reduces critical funding elsewhere.Many in retirement need this protection, but a significant number do not – and should not have it. I watch, aghast, as this generous increase is awarded while public services suffer, and more pressing priorities are sidelined by what amounts to reckless electoral bribery.It’s time to overhaul the state pension. Means testing, a two-tiered system, or scrapping it altogether for higher-earning retirees should all be considered. Funding must be more realistic, dedicated and auditable. Today’s young people pay for our state pensions, and it is costing them dear. The question is: who has the backbone to face this issue head on and take hard decisions? David PlattsNewark, Nottinghamshire SIR – As a baby boomer, may I remind Gen Z that interest rates in the 1970s hit a high of 17 per cent? That meant a crippling mortgage, absolutely no frills, and as for holidays – dream on.Dr René TayarTadworth, Surrey                      Letters to the Editor                    We accept letters by email and post.
