   Ministers scrap Brexit trade rules under £3bn DUP deal to revive Northern Ireland power-sharing that could see Stormont up and running in days despite warnings from hardliners that Brussels will STILL have a say it how it is run MailOnline January 31, 2024 Wednesday 2:22 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:2 Length: 1978 words Byline: David Wilcock, Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline Body   The deal will see Michelle O'Neill become Sinn Fein's first ever First Minister The DUP backed deal includes £3.3billion in funding for Northern Ireland Post-Brexit rules demanding checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland are to be axed in order to get the province's government up and running after a two-year hiatus, it was confirmed today.  Ministers dropped a command paper titled 'Safeguarding The Union' that commits to replacing the current 'green lane process', which requires percentages of goods to be checked as they arrive from Great Britain, with a 'UK internal market system' that will govern the movement of goods that will remain within the United Kingdom. DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has hailed the move as a key concession that will effectively scrap the contentious so-called Irish Sea border for goods destined to remain within the UK. The arrangement includes £3.3billion in new funding for Northern Ireland.  The move will be put to a vote in the Commons tomorrow night, raising hopes that the power-sharing executive can restart as soon as the weekend, after two years idle. The move to reduce post-Brexit checks on GB-NI trade would represent a change to the current EU/UK Windsor Framework agreement and therefore would require Brussels approval. It is understood the EU has been kept up to date with the shape of the Government's package of measures. And some Tory Brexiteers have voiced concerns that the plan may force the whole UK to stay more aligned with EU rules than it otherwise might.  Former PM Boris Johnson tweeted: 'Four years on from Brexit we celebrate the restoration of this country's democratic power to make its own laws and rules.... 'We must retain the appetite and the courage to diverge from the low-growth high-regulation European model.  'We must at all costs avoid a return to anything remotely like the disastrous ''Chequers'' formula whereby artificial concerns about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland are used to keep the whole of the UK in alignment with EU rules.' There were also signs the DUP is not united in support of the bill, with East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson telling the Commons: 'When the Northern Ireland assembly sits, ministers and assembly members will be expected by law to adhere to and implement laws which are made in Brussels, which they had no say over and no ability to amend, and no ability to stop. 'This is a result of this spineless, weak-kneed, Brexit-betraying Government, refusing to take on the EU and its interference in Northern Ireland.' He added: 'Is Northern Ireland going to find it's got the ability to stay tied to the United Kingdom, or will the Government proceed happily to change laws here regardless of the impact it has on Northern Ireland?' Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris replied: "On the fourth anniversary of leaving the European Union, I can tell him absolutely that this agreed package of measures will not change the freedoms and powers we have secured through Brexit or through the Windsor framework. "It will not reduce our ability to diverge nor our commitment to do so should it be in the interest of the United Kingdom." After tense talks that ran into the early hours of yesterday, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party was ready to back a deal that will see Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill installed as the first ever republican First Minister.  Sir Jeffrey has already said that the agreement will remove all post-Brexit checks on goods destined for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.  hailed the move as a key concession that will effectively scrap the contentious so-called Irish Sea border for goods destined to remain within the UK. 'There should not be a border within the UK internal market. These proposals remove that border,' he said. The measure is part of a wide-ranging deal agreed between the DUP and the Government that is set to bring about the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland after a two-year hiatus. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said restored power-sharing in Northern Ireland offered the prospect of a 'brighter future'. Mr Sunak told the Commons: 'After two years without an executive, there is now a prospect of powersharing back up and running, strengthening our Union, giving people the local, accountable government that they need, and offering a brighter future for Northern Ireland.' The DUP has agreed to drop its two-year blockade of Stormont in exchange for the Government measures aimed at addressing its concerns about post-Brexit trading arrangements that created economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The post-Brexit red lane for transporting goods from GB to NI and on into the EU Single Market will remain, but the command paper offers measures aimed at reducing the volume of trade required to use that red-tape heavy route, with a prediction that 80 per cent of goods will now move free of routine checks through the internal market system. Downing Street has said that the deal contains 'significant' changes to the Windsor Framework's 'operation', but is not about altering the 'fundamentals' of the framework. The formal implementation of any changes to the framework are expected to be examined and decided upon within the existing EU/UK Joint Committee framework in the days and weeks ahead. The command paper said the replacement of the green lane would ensure there will be 'no checks when goods move within the UK internal market system save those conducted by UK authorities as part of a risk-based or intelligence-led approach to tackle criminality, abuse of the scheme, smuggling and disease risks'. The paper adds: 'This will ensure the smooth flow of goods that are moving within the UK internal market.' As well as moves to cut Brexit bureaucracy on Irish Sea trade, the command paper includes a series of measures aimed at providing assurances around Northern Ireland's constitutional position within the United Kingdom. Legislation will be tabled with the purpose of 'affirming Northern Ireland's constitutional status underpinned by, among other provisions, the Acts of Union' Sinn Fein's national leader Mary Lou McDonald claimed the move meant the reunification of Ireland was now within 'touching distance'. The DUP walked out of Stormont in February 2022 in protest at post-Brexit trade checks blamed for driving a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The political deadlock has left Stormont paralysed. Sir Jeffrey yesterday said the new deal would mean 'zero checks, zero customs paperwork on goods moving within the United Kingdom'. He added: 'That takes away the border within the UK between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and that is something that's very important.' Downing Street declined to confirm his assessment, saying new proposals would be published following consultation with other parties in Northern Ireland. Ministers remain nervous that the fragile deal could collapse if hardline loyalists judge that the detail does not match Sir Jeffrey's rhetoric. Some members of the DUP's executive were so concerned by the plan that they attended Monday night's crunch briefing 'wired up' to enable loyalist activist Jamie Bryson to conduct a live commentary from outside on what were supposed to be private discussions. Mr Bryson said: 'If, as I suspect, the legislation is at variance with Sir Jeffrey's glossy power point presentation, then he has a very big problem.' Under the terms of the Brexit deal, Northern Ireland has full access to the EU's single market to prevent the need for a hard border with the Republic. But the arrangement has led to EU checks on certain goods entering from Great Britain, triggering unionist anger and shortages of some goods. Rishi Sunak's Windsor Framework deal last year dealt with some of the problems but was not enough to win over the DUP. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, who will publish details of the legislation today, said he now believes that 'all the conditions are now in place' for Stormont to return. The plans include a 'screening mechanism' to reassure unionists that proposals to diverge from EU laws will not create barriers to trade within the UK. Whitehall sources suggested the agreement would make only limited changes to the UK's deal with the EU. The Windsor Framework, signed by Mr Sunak last year, will not be amended.                      The women leading Sinn Fein to power in Ireland                      Sinn Fein is led by two women who may hold power north and south of the border in years to come.  Michelle O'Neill will become Northern Ireland's first republican first minister if the deal agreed by the DUP is ratified, in a momentous moment for the country.  And party president Mary Lou McDonald is in poll position to take power in Ireland in an election expected next year. SF has had the joint highest number of seats in the Dail in the 2020 election but were kept from power by a coalition of Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. McDonald's party is currently leading in the polls, though they are nine points below their peak popularity in 2020. Northern Ireland's First Minister-elect Mrs O'Neill was brought up in one of the most notorious battlegrounds of the Troubles.  And the family of the deputy leader of Sinn Fein were deeply involved in the clashes in East Tyrone. One cousin, Tony Doris, was one of three IRA men killed in an SAS ambush in 1991, when O'Neill was 14. A second, Gareth Doris, was involved in a high explosives attack on a police base in Coalisland in 1997, only a year before the Good Friday Agreement which was to bring peace was signed. He was shot by police but survived. He was sentenced to ten years in jail but, because of the GFA, he was released in less than three. Mrs O'Neill's father, too, was an IRA member. He was interned at the notorious Maze Prison at the height of the Troubles, and spent time in other jails, including Crumlin Road in Belfast, Armagh and Magilligan.  The 47-year-old was born in County Cork shortly after the height of the Troubles. She joined Sinn Fein only after the Good Friday Agreement was signed - at the time, she was 21 and married with a child - and worked for the SF MP Francie Molloy for seven years until 2005. In in 2010 she became the first woman mayor of Dungannon and South Tyrone and served as deputy First Minister under the DUP's Arlene Foster and Paul Givan from 2020.  And after the 2022 election she should have become First Minister, but for the DUP collapsing power-sharing.  And she has attempted to foster an image of moderation in the interregnum. She attracted criticism from allies and opponents when she attended both the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II and the coronation of Charles III, the later alongside Irish president Michael D Higgins. Mary Lou McDonald was born in Dublin on May 1, 1969 and is the new president of Sinn Fein. She was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, the University of Limerick and Dublin City University, studying English Literature, European Integration Studies and Human Resource management. After leaving university, the politician ran for the leadership unopposed and had served as deputy leader since February 2008. She has been a Member of Dáil Éireann, the equivalent of an MP, for Dublin Central since 2011 and had previously served as an MEP for the Dublin constituency from 2004 to 2009. McDonald was previously a member of Fianna Fáil, another Irish republican party, although quit to join Sinn Fein in 1998. She first ran for public office back in 2002, unsuccessfully contesting the Dublin West seat, winning just eight per cent of the vote. She married her husband Martin Lanigan in 1996 and has two children. Raised in the affluent Rathgar area, she she has two brothers and a sister. She has previously said that she 'completely understood and understand why people volunteered for the IRA'. Load-Date: January 31, 2024  End of Document
