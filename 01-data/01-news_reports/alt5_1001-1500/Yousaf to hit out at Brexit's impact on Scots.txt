   Yousaf to hit out at Brexit's impact on Scots The Courier March 12, 2024 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 DC Thomson Co Ltd All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 14 Length: 262 words Body   The first minister will use a speech in London today to attack Labour and the Tories over Brexit. Humza Yousaf will address an event at the London School of Economics, where he will claim spending on Scotland's public services would be £1.6 billion higher if the UK was still in the EU. Independence for Scotland, he will say, would result in a return to the European Union for Scots. "In Scotland, I believe there is broad public agreement that Brexit has damaged the economy and public services, and that it should be reversed," the first minister will say. "Yet at Westminster there is agreement between Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer that the UK should stay out of both the EU and the huge European single market, whatever the cost." Mr Yousaf will go on to say: "The National Institute for Economic and Social Research suggests that, compared to EU membership, the UK economy was 2.5% smaller in 2023 and it expects that figure to rise to 5.7% in little more than 10 years' time. That means that £69 billion could have been wiped from national income in 2023, equating to £28 billion of tax revenue - £2.3 billion in terms of Scotland's population share. "Around 60% of spending in Scotland is on devolved services. With the same level of borrowing and taxation, that means without Brexit devolved spending power for our vital public services could have been £1.6 billion higher than it is today. "In other words, Scotland has suffered an estimated £1.6 billion cut that could have been invested in our NHS because of a Brexit that people in Scotland overwhelmingly rejected."
