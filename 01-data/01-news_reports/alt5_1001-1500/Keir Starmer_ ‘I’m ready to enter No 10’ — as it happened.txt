   Keir Starmer: ‘I’m ready to enter No 10’ — as it happened thetimes.co.uk June 14, 2024 Friday 6:50 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 5771 words Byline: George Sandeman | Max Kendix | Ed Halford | Laurence Sleator | Aubrey Allegretti | George Grylls, Political Correspondent | Debbie White Highlight: In an interview with BBC Panorama, the Labour leader said he knew the party will have to be tough to reach its goals Body   Sir Keir Starmer was interviewed by the BBC’s Nick Robinson on Friday evening, after Labour launched its manifesto on Thursday. Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak is in Italy for the second day of the G7 leaders’ summit as his party reels after Reform overtook the Tories in a poll for the first time. Rishi Sunak has said it is “wonderful news” that the Princess of Wales is to join the royal family at Trooping the Colour this weekend. During a press conference at the G7 in Italy, he said: “The whole country will be behind the Princess of Wales for her recovery. “I saw her statement earlier, I thought it was brave, I thought it was honest and I’m sure it will bring an enormous amount of comfort to so many other people who are grappling with similar health challenges, so I think she deserves enormous praise for what she said and it will be great to see her there tomorrow.” “The conversation is changing” around migration laws in Europe, according to Rishi Sunak (Debbie White writes). “If I’m forced to choose between the security of our borders in our country, and a foreign court, including the ECHR, then I’m going to put our country’s security and our border security first every single time,” he replied when asked whether he could secure reform of the European Convention on Human Rights. “Illegal migration is now a global emergency,” Rishi Sunak has told a press conference at the G7 summit in Italy. “We can’t have criminal gangs decide who comes to our countries,” he added. Leaders discussed ways to combat trafficking and increase investment in countries from where migrants start out on often life-threatening journeys. “More people are moving across borders than at any time in our history. We cannot stand by and watch this human tragedy unfold,” Sunak added. He said he and Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, saw eye-to-eye on migration. A Labour government would not “simply do what any other country asks us to do”, Starmer says. Asked if he would be prepared to stand up to the president of the United States, he says: “Well, I’ll deal with each situation as it arises. We don’t simply do what any other country asks us to do. Every case has to be looked at on its merits. “It will always be a special relationship with the US, whoever is the president. Obviously, it will be up to the American people to decide who that is. If we are elected into government, we will deal with whoever is president of the United States.” Starmer insists he is not hostile to people who use private healthcare, but repeats that he would never pay for it for his family members instead of using the NHS (Max Kendix writes). “I’m not hostile in the slightest”, he says. “I completely understand why people would go private. I know people who have because they wanted to have an operation more quickly, to get back to work or get back to something else. “I damaged my knee playing football a few years ago, my meniscus was torn, I had a scan, I waited my turn, I went to the NHS, got it fixed and I was back playing football. “If I had an acute care, life threatening issue for me or my family, the very best place to be is in the NHS.” Starmer says creating a choice between tax, spend or borrow is “boxing in” the fiscal choices a government can make. He says: “Unlike some Labour leaders that may have sat in a chair like this in an interview with you, my manifesto is about wealth creation. This is a party of wealth creation, of growth, and therefore this boxing-in that everyone is trying to do, particularly in recent days, that the only levers available to a Labour government, or Labour prime minister is to put up tax or pull down spending, I reject that.  “Growth is the lever that I intend to pull. That is why this plan is so carefully thought through.” Starmer says anybody who pays income tax, national insurance or VAT are “working people”. Wes Streeting, Labour’s shadow health secretary, suggested today that the phrase only applied to those on lower incomes. Starmer has said he does not want to raise taxes on working people. Asked whether they would include the likes of Jamie Oliver or Victoria Beckham, Starmer says: “Well, people who pay their income tax, people who pay national insurance are working people.” Sir Keir Starmer says that when it comes to barriers to trading with the EU, problems have existed for more than a decade (Debbie White writes). He said: “I do think we can do better than the botched deal that we got under Boris Johnson. I think every business thinks that. “So, if there are businesses that are watching this, yes, I hear what you say about the barriers to trade, and we are going to do something about that. “If you look at the problems for growth over the last 14 years, they were there, or many of them were there, before Brexit. “So the idea that the sort of single silver bullet is simply a relationship with the EU is not something I accept.” Starmer says he didn’t think Labour would win the last election in 2019 despite serving in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet as shadow Brexit secretary. He says: “I didn’t think we would win the last election in 2019. I don’t think many people did, I’d be surprised if you yourself did. I remember the sense of foreboding when up for that election, the sense that we were never going to win this election. “In 2016, I decided I would serve in the shadow cabinet, because I thought that it was very important that we had an effective frontbench on the question of Brexit, which dominated those years, 2016 to 2019. “I thought that almost irrespective of the leadership of the Labour party, this was going to frame the country for many years to come, and it was important to be on the frontbench.” Starmer refuses to say if there will be tax cuts to public services, but insists “we’re not going back to austerity”. He adds the third path is growing the economy, which he says is “not a want, it’s a plan, that’s the complete difference”. He says: “I ran a public service during austerity, I know what that feels like, I know the damage that it did, and that’s been the legacy of the last 14 years. So we’re not going to go to austerity. “The assumption of those that are saying [this] is that we cannot do any better than we’ve done in the last 14 years — in other words, it’s impossible to grow the economy, and therefore, you’re going to have to tax more, or spend less.” Starmer argues recruiting an additional 6,500 teachers in secondary schools is “a very meaningful change for the children that need it”. The Labour leader is told the measures, which equate to one extra teacher for every three schools and will be funded by introducing VAT on private school fees, have been labelled as “tiny” by independent experts. He says: “Well, it’s not a one-year problem, or a two-year problem, but a budgeting problem that will live with them for the rest of their lives. Because they may not be able to go on to do A Levels, apprenticeships are really hard to get if you haven’t got maths. “It is a very meaningful change for the children that need it.” Labour’s planned changes are not small, Starmer says. He is challenged on whether the scale of the manifesto launched on Thursday matches with the problems the country faces. “I don’t accept they’re very small,” he tells the BBC. “What we’ve set out in the manifesto is a plan for change, a plan to grow the economy. I think that amongst the biggest problems of the last 14 years has been that the economy has been flat. “We haven’t grown the economy, and therefore we haven’t had the money to put into our public services, which are crumbling, and we haven’t been able to raise living standards. So we have to have a plan for growth.” Sir Keir Starmer says he is ready to enter No 10 in three weeks’ time, but insists he is “not complacent” despite his party’s substantial lead in the polls (Max Kendix writes). Asked if he was ready to spend his first night in Downing Street, the Labour leader says: “I’ve spent four and a half years changing the Labour Party, getting it into a position where we could put our offer before the country. “So, yes, we’ve prepared, we’re ready, but I’m conscious that every single vote has to be earned, and we’re still at the stage of earning the votes.” Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed there were no plans for the UK to rejoin the European Union under a Labour government. Nick Robinson, the BBC journalist, asked the Labour leader in the latest Panorama election interview: “Are you willing to make enemies on Brexit? Any business, big business, will say to you, if you want to grow the economy, get rid of those barriers.” Starmer replied: “We obviously had a referendum… I voted to remain, but the vote was to leave. We have left but we are not going back into membership of the EU.” G7 leaders meeting in Italy today hardened their tone against China, warning Beijing to halt sending weapons components to Russia and to stop carrying out “coercive activities in the South China Sea. China was a key focus of the talks in Puglia, amid souring trade relations between Beijing and the West, and concerns that its supplies of equipment to Moscow are fuelling Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine. “We call on China to cease the transfer of dual-use materials, including weapons components and equipment, that are inputs for Russia’s defence sector,” the leaders said in an end-of-summit statement. “We oppose China’s militarisation, and coercive and intimidation activities in the South China Sea,” it added, using stronger language than at last year’s summit in Japan. Pope Francis made a historic appearance at the G7 summit today to speak about the pros and cons of artificial intelligence. Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister and the summit’s host, invited him and other leaders, including Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, and the king of Jordan to show the G7 was not an aloof, exclusive club. The pope arrived in a wheelchair and was warmly greeted by leaders including President Biden and a fellow Argentine, President Milei. The pontiff said that AI could inspire excitement and broaden access to knowledge. “Yet at the same time, it could bring with it a greater injustice between advanced and developing nations or between dominant and oppressed social classes,” he said. Sir Keir Starmer has said he is prepared to make enemies in order to grow the economy. In an interview with the BBC’s Nick Robinson Starmer was asked if he would tell people who are objecting to electricity pylons or housing developments being built near their homes that they would have to see these plans go ahead. “We’re going to have to be tough, we’re going to have to change the way things are done,” he said. At the end of the G7 talks in Italy, the leaders said that the UN Palestinian refugee agency must be allowed to work unhindered in war-torn Gaza (Debbie White writes). They called for all parties to facilitate “rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need” in Gaza, particularly women and children. In a draft statement, the G7 leaders repeated their concern about the “unacceptable number of civilian casualties” in the Hamas-Israel war, now into its ninth month. A former head of polling at No 10 has advised Sir Keir Starmer to take up Nigel Farage’s invitation to take part in a head-to-head debate before the general election. James Johnson, who worked for Theresa May when she was prime minister, said: “Usually these things are just noise — and [this also] probably will be — but if Starmer really wants a Tory wipe-out, he should definitely take up the invitation.” Johnson argued that making the race “Labour vs Farage” would benefit Starmer as “it squeezes the Tories out further”. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, has played down the suggestion that the Labour Party has already won the election, arguing there are still “millions of undecided voters out there” (Ed Halford writes). Speaking on a campaign visit in West Yorkshire, Streeting said: “I don’t believe the opinion polls for a moment.” “I think what the Conservative Party is doing, quite cynically at the moment, is to say to people ‘if you want change, you don’t have to bother going out and voting for it, you can put your feet up, or you can vote for one of the smaller parties and their wish list of promises, because Labour’s going to win anyway’,” he added. Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, has defended the party’s stunt-heavy campaigning style and vowed to keep it going, saying “we don’t take ourselves too seriously”.  Sir Ed Davey, the party leader, has been photographed in a series of stunts,  including falling in Lake Windermere  while paddleboarding. Speaking on a visit to Hertfordshire, she said: “It absolutely is a conscious strategy. We take our politics very seriously but we don’t think politicians should take themselves too seriously. “Ed has won a lot of people’s hearts and minds with this strategy. Every time he’s done a stunt it’s come with a very serious message. There’s almost nothing that’s going to stop Ed from getting out and about, meeting people, doing the stunts and having a lot of fun.” Nigel Farage has challenged Sir Keir Starmer to a debate, saying “this should be the immigration election”.  The Reform UK leader told a press conference this afternoon: “The BBC will be having a leaders’ debate, a four-way leaders’ debate, with the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives, Labour and the SNP. “That takes place next week and I think we can demand that right now the BBC put us into that debate.” The Brexiteer said that the Conservative Party is “done” and predicts it will now be out of power for at least a decade. He also said his party was capable of securing six million votes, pointing to the four million his former party, Ukip, secured in 2015. Boris Johnson has released another video endorsing a Conservative candidate.  The former prime minister backs Nick Fletcher, the Tory candidate in Doncaster East, urging voters to support him “if you want Doncaster airport open”. The video follows Johnson’s endorsement of the former cabinet minister, Simon Clarke, who is standing in Middlesbrough South & East Cleveland. Rishi Sunak has received a letter from the Gambling Commission concerning the inquiry into his parliamentary aide who bet £100 on the date of the election before it was called.  It is understood that Sunak was contacted this week to be told that his parliamentary private secretary, Craig Williams, was the subject of an investigation, according to reports in The Telegraph. Williams bet £100 on the general election being held in July only three days before Sunak made the surprise announcement. The reporting has not been disputed by Williams and he admitted he had a “flutter” on the election a few weeks ago.  He apologised for a “huge error of judgment” but recently refused to answer questions put to him by the BBC’s Joe Pike on whether he had any inside information when he placed the bet. Former Labour leader and independent candidate Jeremy Corbyn has claimed he is “neck and neck” with Labour in the Islington North seat.  Allies of Corbyn are understood to be confident he will win the seat, with about 200 activists a day flocking to the constituency to help him canvas. However a source told Sky News that Corbyn still intends to drum up more support.  “If we get more volunteers out to inform people that Jeremy is standing as an independent, we will win”, the source said.  It is understood that Corbyn’s campaign team believe that complacency could lead to him losing the seat as the Labour candidate, Praful Nargund, has plenty of data to draw from to target voters.  Nargund has been seen campaigning in the seat with Lord Kinnock. The Conservative Party is talking about things they have “imagined”  Labour  is doing rather than the reality, Sir Keir Starmer’s party has said. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “It’s a sign of the chaos and desperation in the Tory campaign that they are spending their time talking about things they have imagined and that Labour isn’t doing, rather than the state of the country after 14 years. “The only surprise is that the imaginary ‘meat tax’ and the fantasy seven bins haven’t made another appearance.” What Labour has not explained — from tax to private schools A poll showing that  Reform UK has overtaken the Conservatives  is a “stark warning”, a cabinet minister has said.  Laura Trott, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said Rishi Sunak could still turn things around despite the YouGov poll for the Times showing the Tories slipping into third place.  Reform has climbed to 19 per cent of the vote while the Tories are unchanged on 18 per cent, according to the poll.  “We’re only halfway through. Things can change,” Trott told a press conference in Westminster. “But the poll is a stark warning.”  “If a result like this is replicated on election day, Keir Starmer will have huge and unchecked power to tax your home, your job, your car, your pension however he wants. “A vote for anyone other than Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives is a vote for Keir Starmer as prime minister.” The Conservative Party has admitted it will increase the tax burden if elected — but claimed the rise would not be as significant as under Labour.  Tory ministers have repeatedly refused to say whether the tax burden, or total tax revenue as a proportion of GDP, would rise.  But in a costings document attacking Labour, the Tories admitted that the tax burden, which is already at its highest level in 70 years, would rise from 36.53 per cent in 2025-26 to 36.81 per cent in 2028-29 under their plans. Based on the same Tory calculations, Labour will increase the tax burden to 37.4 per cent by 2028-29. The Labour Party is “secretly planning to put up  capital gains tax  on your primary residence”, the chief secretary to the Treasury, Laura Trott, has claimed. In a press conference in London, Trott argued that levying the tax on primary homes would be “unprecedented” and a “disastrous policy for families up and down the country”. “I think most people would accept it’d be disastrous for the housing market, and of course, it would put any kind of [housebuilding] target in peril”, she added. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Laura Trott, has repeated the claim widely disputed by experts that the Labour Party’s plans would see taxes rise by over £2,000 per household.  Attacking Tony Blair’s New Labour government in a news conference in central London, Trott argued the last time the party were in power it launched an “infamous raid on pensions”.  And she accused Sir Keir Starmer of failing to “rule out 18 potential tax rises”.  “These are the 18 tax rises that we refuse to let them do quietly. These are the 18 tax rises which Labour need to come clean about,” she added. Trott said it was “obvious” that once Starmer was in No 10 he would “cynically claim the books he inherited are much worse than he thought, as justification for tax rises that he hasn’t told you about”. The LBC presenter, Nick Ferrari, has asked the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, whether he is “aware” of who the president of the United States is while he scrutinised the party’s plans to introduce the age limit of 80 for the House of Lords. Speaking about proposals to make peers quit once they reach their 80th birthday, Ferrari highlighted that President Biden hypothetically would be disqualified from scrutinising legislation were he sitting in the Lords. In response, Streeting said: “And he’s not a member of the House of Lords.” Ferrari followed up by asking: “But he’s not up to running the United States is he?” Streeting refused to answer directly, saying: “That is a decision for the American people in terms of who they elect.” Rishi Sunak and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, shared a pre-match chat ahead of the opening game of the Euros on Friday night.  The match between Scotland and Germany will kick off at 8pm UK time, just as world leaders are preparing to leave the G7 summit in Italy.  Sunak said he was still keen to watch it and had spoken to Scholtz on Thursday in the build up to the match. “I was talking to Olaf about it yesterday, actually. We’re trying to figure out where we can put a TV around this thing,” the prime minister added. The UK has seen an explosion in insecure and low-paid work since 2011, unions have said in a new report that shows there are now 4.1 million people in such employment. The Trades Union Congress said an analysis of official statistics showed the number of people in “precarious” employment — such as zero-hours contracts, low-paid self-employment and casual or seasonal work — increased by nearly one million between 2011 and 2023. They said over that period insecure work rose nearly three times faster than more secure forms of employment. The TUC, a federation of unions representing 5.5 million members, said the report highlights the need for improving workers’ rights and making work pay. Paul Nowak, its general secretary, said: “The UK’s long experiment with a low-rights, low-wage economy has been terrible for growth, productivity and living standards. “Real wages are still worth less than in 2008, and across the country people are trapped in jobs that offer little or no security.” The veterans minister, Johnny Mercer, has said he understands why people would vote for Reform as Tory candidates take stock of the YouGov poll putting Reform ahead of the Conservatives. Mercer is fighting to retain his seat in Plymouth. With Scotland kicking off against Germany in the opening match of the European football championship on Friday night, the SNP has accused Westminster of failing the Tartan Army by not ensuring all Scotland’s matches were on free-to-air television. Qualifying matches for this year’s championship played by England and Wales were broadcast for free but not for the Scots, whose games were behind a paywall. Keith Brown, the party’s depute leader, said: “Scotland supporters have been forced to shell out to watch the Scotland team on their journey to Germany. “The SNP want to see free access to games into the future, with the next generation of John McGinns and Erin Cuthberts able to watch their heroes regardless of their household income, and be inspired to get their boots on and lead us to many more qualifications in the future.” Nigel Farage has reiterated his admiration for Vladimir Putin as a political operator as he urged Ukraine to negotiate with Russia.  The Reform UK leader, who said in 2014 he admired the Russian president as strategist, was asked on BBC 5Live if he still agreed with this assessment. He said: “How many years has been in power? He’s gone from prime minister to president. He’s a clever political operator. He kills journalists. I don’t like him as a human being in any way at all [but] you can recognise that fact that some people are good at what they do even if they have evil intent.” Asked about ending the war in Ukraine: “This war has been going on for years. It is likely to go on for many more years [and it is] looking like something like a million casualties between the two sides. “I’m not saying we shouldn’t support Ukraine not for one minute but at the end of the day most wars end in negotiation.” The rise in the waiting list for routine hospital treatment has “blown a hole in Rishi Sunak’s credibility”, the shadow health secretary Wes Streeting has argued.  It has been estimated that 7.57 million treatments were waiting to be carried out at the end of April, which is an increase from the 7.54 million treatments at the end of March, according to figures obtained from NHS England.  Streeting highlighted that Sunak had “said he would cut waiting lists when he became prime minister” but they were “now higher”.  The Labour Party has committed to delivering 40,000 more appointments per week if elected. “We’ve got a strong record on this. The last Labour government delivered the shortest waiting times and highest patient satisfaction in the history of the NHS”, he added. “Polls go all over the shop and they don’t necessarily indicate the outcome”, the former Brexit secretary and Conservative MP Sir David Davis has said.  Asked on Sky News whether it was “all over” for the Conservative Party, Davis said: “No. Certainly not on the basis of what I am seeing on the doorstep. This is my 11th election campaign. All of them, things go wrong on both sides.”  Davis predicted the polls would move as he claimed people would realise the Labour Party is planning to put up taxes while the Conservatives are planning to cut them.  “They are starting to look past all the shenanigans with Farage and so on and saying, ‘You know I might have voted Reform but actually that’ll just help Labour, I am going to vote Tory’,” he added Nigel Farage has doubled down on his claim that Rishi Sunak does not understand British culture despite previous criticism that it amounted to “dog whistle” racism.  His comments had followed the prime minister’s decision to leave D-Day commemorations early. Asked if he still believes Sunak does not relate to British culture, he said: “He doesn’t know where the centre ground of opinion in this country is. “Rishi is Winchester College, Oxford University, Goldman Sachs. He has no connection with working people in this country at all. “I get on with people of all backgrounds, all classes. Rishi Sunak lives in this very, very narrow world like so many politicians.”  Asked if he was more patriotic than the other party leaders, Farage said: “Without a doubt.” Boris Johnson has released a video backing a former Cabinet colleague in his Middlesbrough seat on Friday morning. The former prime minister recorded the minute-long video endorsing Sir Simon Clarke, the former levelling up secretary. Both Labour and the Conservatives are “losing ground” to Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats, Sir John Curtice has said.  The polling expert said there are “broad trends” in the general election opinion polls benefitting the smaller parties.  He told the BBC: “There are now some broad trends in the polls and it is a story of both the Conservatives and the Labour Party losing ground as compared with the beginning of the campaign. “So who is gaining? One is undoubtedly Reform. On average in the seven polls this week they are at 16 points. I think there is reason to believe that maybe that is slightly on the high side… but even so, certainly not short of 15 points. “But the other thing that has also begun to emerge in polls this week is that the Liberal Democrats are now making some progress as well.” Labour will not accept “crocodile tears” from private schools “pleading poverty” over the party’s plans to introduce VAT on fees, Wes Streeting has said.  Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said private schools were being “alarmist” by claiming there would be an “exodus” of pupils to state schools.  He told Times Radio: “If it were the case that schools and indeed their customers were that price sensitive, we wouldn’t have seen them raising their own fees above inflation for more than a decade. It’s no good independent schools pleading poverty now, I’m just not buying it. “They didn’t blink when they were levying higher than inflation increases on parents at their schools. So forgive me for not believing the crocodile tears of independent schools now.” Nigel Farage has referenced Eminem’s “Without Me” in a buoyant clip released on social media on Friday morning, after YouGov polling for The Times showed his party overtake the Conservatives in support.  Sitting in the back of a car with a copy of the Daily Mail beside him, Farage joins in with the lyrics “guess who’s back, back again”. The words from the lead single of                     The Eminem Show                    , Eminem’s 2002 album, signified the return of the rapper’s unhinged alter ego.  In Farage’s case, the meaning is more simple — the Tories are in serious trouble, and he is more than happy to take the credit. Rishi Sunak suggested he was confident the Conservatives would not come third behind Reform in the general election, after a new poll.  The prime minister believed there was still time for him to make a comeback, saying: “We’re only halfway through this election, so I’m fighting very hard for every vote.”  It came after a YouGov poll for The Times showed Reform ahead of the Conservatives for the first time — showing Reform had increased by two points to 19 per cent, while the Tories were unchanged on 18 per cent. “What that poll shows — as ever, the only poll that matters is the one on polling day — but if that poll was replicated on 4 July it would be handing Labour a blank cheque,” Sunak told reporters on the final day of the G7 summit in Italy.  He added: “I’m fighting very hard to make sure that doesn’t happen.”  Sunak suggested he thought the Tories’ prospects would improve as the election gets closer. He said: “When people sit down, especially now this week when everyone can see very clearly the difference in approach from the two parties, I think that choice will crystallise for people between now and polling day. We’re only halfway through.” The Conservatives “haven’t accepted we’re going to lose this election”, a senior minister has said. Bim Afolami, economic secretary to the treasury, told Times Radio: “We’re fighting for every vote. And indeed, my constituents in Hitchin, I’m out literally every single day speaking to people.  “What I would say is that handing Keir Starmer and Labour an unchecked power to do whatever they want is not a good outcome for the British people. And I don’t believe that’s what the British people want. And that’s one of the reasons why we’re saying vote Conservative to stop the damaging plans from Labour.” Afolami later added to LBC: “Of course we can win”. Nigel Farage says Reform UK will win seats at the general election but has refused to set any targets. Appearing on BBC Breakfast, the Reform UK leader says his party has had a “phenomenal start” to the campaign after admitting they were not ready for the election when Rishi Sunak called it. Pointing to the YouGov poll in The Times, Farage said: “Are we going to win seats in parliament? Yes.”  Asked on what the party’s target is, he said: “I have no idea. I have no targets. We are gonna win seats, how many I don’t know. If this momentum continues who’s to say. “Starmer’s going to have a very big majority and I don’t think he has much of a plan so I want us to become the opposition voice in parliament and the country.” Rishi Sunak is in Puglia, Italy, on Friday for the second day of the G7 leaders’ summit and is expected to return to the campaign trail on Saturday. In London the Conservatives will launch an attack on Labour’s manifesto with a press conference from Laura Trott, the chief secretary to the treasury, later on Friday morning. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, will take part in a half-hour interview with the BBC from 7.30pm. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, and Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, will meet business leaders in the capital on Friday morning. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, will be in Wakefield to discuss Labour’s mental health plans. Daisy Cooper, the deputy leader of the Lib Dems, will be campaigning in Hertfordshire on Friday afternoon while Keith Brown, depute leader of the SNP, is in West Lothian. The rise in NHS waiting lists is a “blip”, a senior minister has said.  New figures released yesterday showed 6.33 million patients were waiting for 7.57 million treatments to be carried out at the end of April. Rishi Sunak, the prime minister, promised to reduce waiting lists last January, when it stood at 7.21 million treatments.  Bin Afolami, the economic secretary to the treasury, insisted the increase was temporary after months where the list had come down.  He told Times Radio: “Over the last seven months, waiting lists have been coming down, and I’m confident that this temporary tick up is just that – a blip. We will continue going down the positive trajectory to cutting waiting lists which has been happening for most of the past year.” Voters should not give Sir Keir Starmer “unchecked power” by voting for Reform UK, a senior minister has said.  A YouGov poll for The Times has put support for Reform higher than the Conservatives for the first time. Bim Afolami, the economic secretary to the treasury, told Times Radio: “There’s a poll every single day of this campaign, it’s one poll out of literally hundreds. What it does show is that there is significant difficulty of Keir Starmer having unchecked power to do all the things like tax your home, your job, your car and your pension.” The Liberal Democrats have accused the Conservatives of “standing idly by” while food prices increased as they launched their national food strategy aimed at curtailing costs. The party also plans to boost the farming budget by £1 billion a year and proposes to bring down food prices by renegotiating trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand. Daisy Cooper, the party’s deputy leader, said: “The Conservatives have been standing idly by whilst families and pensioners struggle to put food on the table.” She added: “The best way to bring down food prices is to back British farmers. Our farmers have been taken for granted by the Conservative Party, left to cope with sky-high energy bills and botched overseas trade deals.” Labour have outlined a mental health plan that they say will “get people back to work” as the party aims to increase economic growth. The party pledged to recruit an extra 8,500 new mental health staff to treat children and adults as well as making support available in every school. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said the crisis in mental illness is keeping people out of the labour market and costing the country billions. Ahead of a visit to a men’s mental health charity on Friday, he said: “People right across the country are being denied the support that they need to get into work and stay in work.” Reform are now polling ahead of the Conservatives for the first time in this general election campaign in a so-called crossover moment. The YouGov survey for The Times found support for Reform now stood at 19 per cent, one percentage point more than for the Conservatives. Labour are still ahead on 37 per cent. At the beginning of last night’s debate on ITV, Reform leader Nigel Farage said: “Just before we came on air we overtook the Conservatives in the national opinion polls. We are now the opposition to Labour.” However, the poll also found that 80 per cent of those backing Reform felt that a very large majority for Labour would be a “bad thing for the country”.
