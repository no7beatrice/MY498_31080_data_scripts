Hundreds of women start lining up at nine in the morning in front of a street-side shop: ahead, five hours of waiting until the doors open at The Music Room, a place located near the iconic Bond Street and Oxford Street, well known for hosting sample sales for international luxury clothing brands. This time the sale had a special character: it was probably the last chance for The Vampire's Wife fans to get their hands on one of her recognizable dresses. The brand had announced its closure just a few days before, in a decision that was no less painful for its fans. Each of these women had a personal history with the brand. There was, for example, a mother and daughter who had traveled almost 400 kilometers from Yorkshire to buy a wedding dress: they were going to buy it online but this way the purchase became a more special memory. Alongside them was a mix of loyal fans of the brand, regular buyers of discounted sample collections and fashion stalwarts who had heard about the event a few hours earlier online or in the media. "The room was decorated with a mix of ready-to-wear, accessories and souvenirs (mugs, pencils, bags, postcards). There was a great selection of iconic dresses and one-offs that were extremely popular, including iconic styles such as Falconetti, Villanelle and Festival," Natalie Messer, Assistant Operations Manager at The Music Room, tells S Moda. The three-day sale sold out: more than 3,600 people attended the brand's farewell, which ended up being something of a farewell rite tinged with nostalgia. "Shoppers were sad to see the brand disappear and interacted with the staff, sharing stories of their favorite dresses and their memories of wearing them," recalls Natalie Messer.         View this post on Instagram          Just three days earlier, the brand communicated its immediate closure via Instagram and on its website: "It's time to say goodbye," Susie Cave posted, acknowledging that the financial problems that had been stalking them for months were now insurmountable. In 2014 the British model founded The Vampire's Wife with her friend Alex Adamson in her hometown of Brighton, England. In a very short time this small fashion label caught the attention of artists, actresses, musicians and cultural icons of the moment: Sienna Miller, Kate Moss, Florence Welch, Alexa Chung or Rachel Weisz and many of the most prominent women in the UK, often dressed in the brand on the recommendation of London PR expert Daisy Hoppen. "Every time you put on one of her dresses you felt like it was made for you," actress Greta Bellamacina, a frequent model for the brand, once told The Standard. And so the list of the brand's followers became international. Kylie Minogue, Salma Hayek, Greta Gerwig and Dakota Johnson. She even appeared in the series Killing Eve. Of course, Susie Cave was no amateur in the fashion world. Wife of musician Nick Cave, she has spent her life in the industry, modeling for major fashion houses such as Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior, John Galliano and Vivienne Westwood and working for established photographers such as Nick Knight, Guy Bourdin and Dominique Issermann. Susie Cave won the Woman of the Year award for best designer in the 2018 British edition of Harper's Bazaar, the same year that British Vogue chose her brand's Falconetti model, recognizable by its flared sleeves and £1,595 price tag, as "The Dress (with a capital letter) of 2018″. The brand reached a new milestone by becoming a favorite in the British royal family. When in 2020 Kate Middleton first wore the famous Falconetti in an emerald hue the frenzy for the brand went into overdrive around the world. The design was named after French actress Maria Falconetti, and ended up with the revealing nickname "the dress of the decade." The Princess of Wales decided to wear it again for her first official joint portrait with Prince William for her 40th birthday: nothing dates the picture more obviously than the dress of the moment. Cave was, as the British press reported, "ecstatic and genuinely proud" at the time. That dress had achieved such worldwide fame that it could end up devouring the brand, which partly happened later. According to stylist Bay Garnett, Cave's rise as a fashion designer was due to "her ability to filter the best of vintage and turn it into timeless garments that anyone can wear today. The [Falconetti dress] picked up on the Galaxy dress moment that Roland Mouret had , where a dress becomes exponential and has a life of its own," she told The Standard. "Once it stops looking shiny and unique, the magic can disappear." Madrid also forged a significant fandom for Susie Cave, the brand and, more specifically, for Falconetti. One of the first places to shop The Vampire's Wife was Experience27, a space founded in 2021 by Sarah Barney, who previously worked in the fashion industry in New York for two decades for major companies such as Saks Fifth Avenue as visual director of its flagship store in New York. Surprised to see "so few small multi-brand boutiques and especially few that sold smaller, independent designers," she decided to bring brands like The Vampire's Wife to Spain. "It was an amazing brand with a new perspective on fashion. At that time there was nothing like Susie's dresses, which gave off incredible appeal and sensuality without being too revealing. When I first learned about the brand, they were working with a showroom, and later took over sales. It was a small, passionate team. Working with them was charming and intimate," recalls Sarah Barney for S Moda. At their store on Calle Orellana, in the Justicia neighborhood, they sold out of "all of The Vampire's Wife dresses, but by far the most requested and best-selling was the classic Falconetti dress, and in our case, in the soft metallic gold color. The brand knew how to cut a dress with immaculate precision. This style suited women of all shapes and sizes: it looked amazing on every woman who wore it. The feedback from every customer who tried it on was that it fit them beautifully. This is very rare in designer fashion," she explains.

"From 20-year-olds to 80-year-old women were buying garments from The Vampire's Wife. We had dresses, ready-to-wear and special pieces, such as a selection of capes. The dresses were primarily purchased to attend weddings. The ready-to-wear garments were purchased for everyday wear or for more casual events. These garments were always made in 100% silk or velvet, so they were always very elevated and could be worn on many occasions," says Sarah Barney. "Some customers bought more than once from the collections, but more for the ready-to-wear pieces than for the more formal dresses. Prices ranged from 500 to 2100 euros. While these prices may seem high, The Vampire's Wife was a luxury brand, with premium materials and detailed, well-crafted craftsmanship. In the luxury world, I found the prices to be low for the value of each piece compared to competing designer brands." After a couple of seasons, however, the store stopped selling the brand. "Uniquely for economic reasons. With the Brexit, deliveries from the U.K. became extraordinarily difficult, with delays and customs costs.... Brexit was, and is, a very important factor in deciding whether we can sell a UK brand." This affects all small UK brands and independent designers," explains Sarah Barney. "Larger brands were able to transition to having EU-based warehouses to avoid these delays and additional costs, but that's not a reasonable solution for a small brand. At the same time, for our part, as a small family-owned business, the costs of Brexit are difficult to sustain. The big department stores and major e-commerce websites can also absorb those costs, while smaller stores struggle with it," he acknowledges. With the Brexit, deliveries from the UK became extraordinarily difficult, with delays and customs costs. Brexit was, and is, a very important factor in deciding whether we can sell a brand." As far as "fandom" is concerned, he recounts, "Madrid definitely had fans of the brand. People were excited to see it in the store. And the only time we had a dispute between customers in our space was over the last dress of a specific style." At the same time, The Vampire's Wife appeared in Madrid in another space, Love is in the Air, which specializes in international bridal and guest brands and has recently expanded under a new concept: rental. Isabel Ruiz, founder of the store, is always looking for different things, luxury bridal and guest brands that are not easily found in Spain. And that's how, a couple of years ago, "I don't know if it was because it was on Instagram or because Kate Middleton was wearing it, I wrote to them and went to see their showroom in Paris. It was in an ideal location in Le Marais and there was Susie Cave, so cool. I saw the collection, loved it and brought it back. My clients liked it from the first moment: everyone, from foreigners who come to the store to many mothers of the bride, not only people from the fashion world or very modern people from 30 to 45 years old, but also older women. They like The Vampire's Wife dresses because they fit very well, they are not too daring or spectacular in the sexy sense, and they work very well for events," the businesswoman shares with SModa. The most successful, she adds, is again the midi or ankle-length "Falconetti" dress in red. She still has one left in store, and another in silver. Now that the store has launched a rental service, it is possible to access one of these dresses for a few days at a fraction of the price. The growth of the brand's popularity coincided with the rise of online fashion rental sites, and it began to garner a lot of success on portals like My Wardrobe HQ or By Rotation, but this option was never among The Vampire's Wife's plans.         View this post on Instagram          Eva Chen, founder of the clothing rental platform for events Borow -which provides the logistics to the rental in Love is in the Air- recalls it for S Moda. A couple of years ago this entrepreneur tried to convince the brand to make the move to its rental system and thus enter the circular fashion business. They were not interested, something that, in Chen's opinion, did not help the well-being of her business. "By not upgrading much to other consumption models they have ended up cannibalizing their channel. We are seeing that those who refuse new consumption models to protect their brand end up facing difficulties because in the end peer to peer platforms emerge where end user to end user, among them, they rent clothes and even appear on second hand sites like Vinted Wallapop, etc. From all those channels the brand gets nothing. When there are platforms or models that try to integrate the brand or the designer and that there are synergies in terms of the product and also in terms of income, we believe that this is the smartest way for brands to set foot in the circular economy and take their share. The Vampire's Wife didn't do it in other countries where renting has really taken off and these are garments that worked very well on a private-to-private basis because they are expensive garments that people generally don't want to have in their closet and wear on a recurring basis and there came a time when few people wanted to pay the price that they were selling for". For Susie Cave, The Vampire's Wife was not only a business gamble but also an avenue to process a painful grief. In July 2015, shortly after the brand's launch, she lost her 15-year-old son Artur after a tragic accident. In Andrew Dominik's 2016 documentary One More Time With Feeling, which followed her husband Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in the creation of their 16th album, Susie explains, "Since everything that happened, my work has become something different. Before it was something I did because I enjoyed it, but then it became a real necessity. It was the one thing that distracted me from everything." Much has been written about Susie Cave's magnetism, but probably no one has defined her style better than her husband, Nick Cave, in the documentary 20,000 Days on Earth. The musician tells how he met the woman who would become his wife: "The first time I saw Susie was at the Victoria and Albert Museum, she came in and all the things that had obsessed me over the years, the images of movie stars: Jenny Agutter in the pond, Anita Ekberg in the fountain, Ally McGraw in her black stockings; Barbara Eden and Elizabeth Montgomery and Abigail from the Miss World pageants; Greta Garbo and Jennifer Jones and the Bolshoi dancers and the Russian gymnasts; Botticelli's The Birth of Venus and François Boucher, the girls in the Wangaratta pool lying on the hot concrete; everything I had heard, seen, read and felt; Caroline Jones dying in Elvis's arms, Jackie O at the funeral, Tinkerbell caught in the door, Bert Stern's last pictures of Marilyn Monroe, the endless drip of erotic data - the big and the small - all came together in that moment, colliding in one big explosion and I was absolutely lost to it." Now, after a series of financial problems that have ended up being irresolvable, this brand of mystical, bohemian, elegant and absolutely unique aesthetics, like its creator, closes its business but also an era.
