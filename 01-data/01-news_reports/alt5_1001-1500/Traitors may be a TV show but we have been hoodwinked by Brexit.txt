   Traitors may be a TV show but we have been hoodwinked by Brexit Metro (UK) February 2, 2024 Friday Edition 1, Scotland  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 15 Length: 242 words Body   n The latest TV series of The Traitors, where you try to fool fellow players into thinking you're something you are not, reminded me of the latest Brexit debacle. Talks aimed at reaching a trade deal with Canada have collapsed in acrimony. It had been proclaimed by the Tory government that a free trade agreement with the UK's Commonwealth ally would have been the easiest to strike post-Brexit. Indeed, one of the great benefits claimed by those who led the Brexit campaign was that Britain would be free to sign new economic pacts all over the world. The two nations have been negotiating for the last two years but talks have failed due to a fall-out over beef and cheese quotas. As with The Traitors, Brexit backers were hoodwinked by a package of promises that turned out, as many warned, to be utter rubbish. Alex Orr, Edinburgh n In my letter (MetroTalk, Jan 25), I said we had been given false promises that Brexit would enable us to be our own masters in any trade agreement. Within a day we had further proof when talks with Canada failed. If we cannot come to a deal with Canada, what hope is there? R Walker, Glasgow n UK government minister Andrea Leadsom has said Brexit red tape is the 'price you pay for being a sovereign state again' (Metro, Thu). I don't recall reading that on the side of a bus. Ms Leadsom appears to think most in the UK do not know the UK was sovereign while it was in the EU. Brexit is a financial disaster.
