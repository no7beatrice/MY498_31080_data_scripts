   Farage: I could be bridge between Trump and Starmer telegraph.co.uk April 8, 2024 Monday 2:03 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:5 Length: 4163 words Byline: By Dominic Penna, Political Correspondent and Genevieve Holl-Allen, Political Reporter and Amy Gibbons, Political Correspondent Body   Nigel Farage has suggested that he would be willing to work alongside a Labour government as a trade envoy if Donald Trump becomes US president.  Mr Farage, the former Ukip leader predicted his friend would win the presidential election and said he would be “very interested” to work with Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader.  Mr Farage made the claims during a question and answer session, presented by the Telegraph Politics newsletter, with Camilla Tominey, The Telegraph’s associate editor, and dozens of Telegraph subscribers. “All I’m struck by is that we have an incoming Labour government – 99 per cent certain, according to John Curtice  – who have no affinity to Trump’s form of conservatism whatsoever,” he said. “There’s no way around it, our relationship with America on defence is absolutely crucial. In terms of trade, we are still the biggest foreign investor in America, they are the biggest foreign investor here. “There needs to be some sort of envoy between an incoming Labour government with people like David Lammy – who’s probably going to the foreign secretary, who’s been really quite abusive about Trump …” Asked whether he wanted to be “Starmer’s man in Washington”, Mr Farage replied: “That isn’t going to happen. It may well be the other way round. But I do think in the national interest there needs to be an intermediary between Trump and an incoming Labour government. And if I can help with that, I’d be very interested to do so.” Mr Farage said he had not spoken directly to Sir Keir about such a possibility, but had held talks with “other people around the Labour Party”, adding: “If it’s not me, they need someone to be an intermediary. Not an ambassador, but someone a little more covert.” Asked directly whether Mr Trump had offered him a job, he quipped: “I can’t remember.” Mr Farage also predicted that Reform UK would win more votes  than the Conservative Party at the next general election. Accusing the Tories of blowing the 80-seat majority they won in 2019, he said: “I think Reform will get, with or without me , more votes than the Conservatives at the next election, in terms of numbers. “How that transpires in terms of seats is absolutely anybody’s guess. But I can see the momentum. May 2 [the local elections] is going to be a disaster for the Conservatives.” Mr Farage ruled out joining the Tory Party “even if they asked me”, while also pouring cold water on the prospect of a “dream ticket” with Boris Johnson , the former prime minister, saying they would not agree on anything. Asked about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Mr Farage noted that the casualty count was now “just about equivalent to the Battle of the Somme” and called for negotiations aimed at ending the conflict.  “We can keep giving weapons to Ukraine, the stalemate can continue and Putin has completely reshaped the Russian economy, it’s about the war or nothing else, or we can have negotiations. “I think we have to have negotiations and I think Trump will go for those negotiations… What is the endgame of this, what is the goal? If we think it’s a Ukrainian victory, that’s for the birds.” Mr Farage also paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher on the 11th anniversary of her death, praising her as a “fighter” and saying: “If there’s a similarity, it’s fighting for things that may not be trendy today, but may well be tomorrow.” It came as Richard Tice, the Reform UK leader , warned candidates not to get drunk and post on social media after the party ditched several prospective MPs over a string of offensive comments. In the past week alone, the party has dropped five candidates over a series of social media posts described as racist, sexist and homophobic. Taking questions at a press conference in central London, where he was setting out his party’s plans for NHS reform, Mr Tice was asked how confident he was that he would not have to drop more aspiring MPs. “We’re very clear to all our candidates, for heaven’s sake… if you’re going to have a glass on a Friday night, then don’t use social media,” he said. “It’s not sensible. And if someone lets us down hereafter, then frankly, if it’s inappropriate, if it’s unacceptable, then we’re going to part company. “So you can have your freedom of speech and freedom of expression, but that doesn’t mean you have the right to represent Reform UK as a parliamentary candidate, because that’s our choice.” Watch the question-and-answer session above.

Thank you for joining our coverage of Camilla Tominey’s interview with Nigel Farage.                      You can watch how the interview unfolded in the live stream at the top of this blog.                                         08 Apr 2024-12:59PM GMT                                         Farage: Like Thatcher, I’m a fighter                    Asked if Reform’s polling share would go up if he was involved, Nigel Farage joked: “Might do.” Pressed on whether we need another Margaret Thatcher and if it was him, Mr Farage replied: “I wouldn’t put myself in that category although she was a fighter, she stood up and fought for issues not because focus groups told her she should, but because she believed in.” Mr Farage said he had started “without majority support” but through “sheer persistence and perhaps being right”, he had convinced people. “If there is a similarity it’s fighting for things that may not be trendy today, but may well be tomorrow.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:58PM GMT                                         More Tories will defect to Reform-and it’s the only way to save their skin, says Farage                    Asked whether he expected any more Tory MPs to defect to Reform, Nigel Farage said: “Yes. I don’t know how many... I’m just the honorary president.” Pressed on whether conversations were taking place with disillusioned Conservatives, he replied: “I believe so, but I’m not involved in them. I’m the honorary president. “May 2 won’t be easy for Reform because people will realise how relatively small it is, and that’s true. I re-emphasise they’re not even standing in 10 per cent of seats. They’ve not got the Ukip machine that Ukip had 10 years ago at this moment in time. “I think Tice’s performances become more and more confident and I think his ability to manage fact around policy puts him a class above Starmer and Sunak, he’s actually terribly good at this. Already there are more Leave voters from the 2016 referendum that are going to vote Reform than Conservative. “There comes a moment where if that momentum continues, and I think it will, you’re a Red Wall Conservative MP the only way to save your skin is to stand for Reform, not stand for Reform and then Reform must say to the Conservatives ‘you must not split the vote, otherwise you’ll let Labour in’.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:53PM GMT                                         Farage: Ukrainian victory over Russia is ‘for the birds’                    Donald Trump has “done more good than Nato than bad”, Nigel Farage said. “As far as Ukraine is concerned, this idea that Trump was the one that was soft on Putin... Angela Merkel was the one who was soft on Putin. She made Germany entirely dependent on gas imports... Talk about hypocrisy, we whether it’s Bentley, whether it’s many of the parts that go into the drones, we’re still selling Russia loads of stuff. This pretence that since the invasion of Ukraine we’ve put the toughest ever “It is quite sobering to think that the casualty count over these first two years is now just about equivalent to the Battle of the Somme. It really is, it’s about a million casualties. It’s about a million people seriously injured or killed in a war, a war which is frankly going nowhere. “We can keep giving weapons to Ukraine, the stalemate can continue and Putin has completely reshaped the Russian economy, it’s about the war or nothing else, or we can have negotiations. I think we have to have negotiations and I think Trump will go for those negotiations.” Asked if not supplying Ukraine with weapons was a “huge failure of the West”, Mr Farage replied: “We’re not actually in a fit position to do so, so the burden once again falls on America. A lot of American figures are saying we’re not endlessly going to keep pumping money and weaponry in. “If anyone can get the two around the negotiating data... It may fail. We can send British troops, have World War Three, I don’t mind... I don’t approve of anything Putin’s done in terms of this invasion. But we have to think through what is the endgame of this, what is the goal? If we think it’s a Ukrainian victory, that’s for the birds.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:49PM GMT                                         Farage: Brexit hasn’t benefited small businesses                    Elliot, a small business owner, asked Nigel Farage what Brexit had benefited small businesses. “Nothing, absolutely nothing,” Mr Farage replied. Pressed on whether he regretted standing Brexit Party candidates down, he said: “No. We were never given any opportunity... The day after the referendum I mused with people I’d been out partying with all night that the delivery of Brexit was in the hands of the people we’d been fighting for the last 25 years.” On small businesses, he said: “Small businesses are hated by the Treasury, not understood by the Government and certainly not understood by the opposition.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:46PM GMT                                         Farage suggests he could be more influential on TikTok than as an MP                    Asked if he was worried about Chinese interference on TikTok, he said: “There is a concern with that but for the moment that is the medium this generation use. “Do most MPs in their careers in the modern day have much influence over national debate, have much influence over our lives? Very, very little. One of the points of Brexit was to make politics matter again, to make Parliament sovereign again. “There is an argument I can be much more effective as I am than sitting in the House of Commons. Whatever happens on the centre-Right, there has to be a plan to start making MPs and Parliament actually matter again and stop this massive transfer of power that’s gone to the quangos. And Liz Truss is absolutely right about all of this. “You can argue she was doing too much too soon, but the basic premise there is a loss of sovereignty here as well as Brussels I think that is very strong. There are a lot of young people who are saying ‘no, I don’t want this’.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:43PM GMT                                         Farage: Gen Z are a great hope for conservatism                    Asked by Lewis, who is in the audience, what hope young Conservatives could have, Nigel Farage replied: “I think there is great hope with Gen Z. This 15 to 25 age group are very different to the millennials before, they’re mostly gone, millennials are mostly gone. “I see a lot of people in that 15 to 25 age bracket who want to get on, want to do well, are not buying the indoctrination they’re getting at schools. It’s more of a male than female thing at this moment in time and that’s quite noticeable. But I’ve got great hope. “I think there is a young generation coming through that are rejecting the rubbish they’ve been fed... I would love to see a government really trying to help young people. Sunak’s got it completely wrong. Maths to 18? By the age of 16 the majority of kids don’t want to see algebra again as long as they live. “But if you give them the chance to learn trades and skills... I actually think I would say to young people history suggests that with most things, we can get the pendulum to swing back. There’s a lot of younger people who are becoming much more conservative in their opinions.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:39PM GMT                                         Farage offers to be Starmer’s man in America                    On what job he wanted to do for Donald Trump, Nigel Farage said: “All I’m struck by is we have an incoming Labour Government who have no affinity to Trump’s form of conservatism whatsoever. There’s no way round it, our relationship with America on defence is absolutely crucial and we are the bridge I think for the other European countries.” Asked if he wanted to be “Starmer’s man in Washington”, he said: “In the national interest, there needs to be an intermediary between Trump and an incoming Labour government, and I’d be happy to do that.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:39PM GMT                                         Farage calls for ECHR referendum                    Asked whether there should be a referendum on net zero immigration, Nigel Farage said: “I think a referendum that would be useful is a referendum on the ECHR and whether we should allow a court on Strasbourg to overrule us. “I urged them again and again include the ECHR in this when it comes to the Brexit negotiations. Boris was never going to do that, no interest to him. If you have a referendum on that... I’d love a referendum on the House of Lords, now that would be good sport. Should we replace it with a mostly elected second chamber? “I look at Switzerland which is probably the most democratic country in the world. If the Swiss people want to call a legally-binding referendum on an issue because they feel the Parliament’s out of step with the country, they can call that referendum and it is a legally-binding result. “If we had had that ability in this country, we never would have had that 10 million population increase.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:34PM GMT                                         Farage: ‘Every single election’ using postal votes is flawed                    Nigel Farage pointed to events in Tower Hamlets and the West Midlands to claim “every single election” fought in British cities was flawed. Asked if the 2020 US election was stolen, Mr Farage responded: “I wouldn’t say stolen... We should 100 per cent scrap postal votes, go back to the pre-2001 system. In France you vote for a president, you have to turn up on a Sunday... The votes are divided up into physical piles in front of observers, counted, there are no voting machines...” “Scrap the postal voting register in its entirety and start again. And if you are elderly or infirm or you do work overseas or you’ve got a serious illness, you apply online for a postal vote.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:31PM GMT                                         Farage: I want to aim for net zero immigration                    On whether he would want a cap on immigration, Nigel Farage replied: “I would like to aim for something around about net zero. “I would like to aim for something around about net zero. I’m teasing a bit but you know what I mean.” Asked whether he viewed Donald Trump as a genius, a flawed genius or just flawed, he said: “His instincts on the big stuff are just unbelievable. I very much expect him to win in November and as a result of that I think the world will become a safer place. “Inside the Westminster bubble you’re all terribly concerned about his foibles, out there in the real world nobody gives a damn.” Mr Farage said what happened on Jan 6, 2021 was “ugly” but not an “insurrection”, adding: “It was not a good day at any level. But what we’ve seen again and again and again is mailout postal voting leads to mass fraud and mass intimidation. It is no way to conduct elections.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:29PM GMT                                         Farage on benefits, immigration and why he chose the name Reform                    Nigel Farage said he chose the name Reform “because we need wholesale change in terms of how we make these decisions”. “Regardless of whether the Conservatives win again or Labour were to win, what is the difference going to be?” Mr Farage said an Australian-style points system allowed you “to set the points where you want to... They set the points levels so low that that’s why you’ve now got record numbers of people coming. The only people we want to come into the country are those who are genuinely going to be a benefit in the nation. They’ve got to bring something special to the country that we haven’t got already.” Asked about the worklessness crisis, he replied: “If you go on an M25 on half past five on a Monday morning, you will see people running their little businesses, working their backsides off, being taxed so much... The resentment that hardworking people now have for people who do not work is enormous. “The first thing is the carrot, make sure no one pays tax on the first £20,000 they earn. Make the difference between working and living on benefits hugely significant. “Secondly I haven’t thought this through fully, but I am very much of the view that the number of young people who because they say that they’re depressed or stressed are allowed to go on disability benefits, get an extra £390 for doing so, with no obligation to even look for work... “We’re allowing the traumas that happen in all of our lives... We’re allowing normal everyday ups and downs to be diagnosed as traumas. Actually they’re dealing with the knocks we all get in our lives. We’re going to have to rethink how we reclassify people with mental illness.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:24PM GMT                                         Farage: ‘Population explosion’ biggest issue facing Britain                    Asked how worried he was about Sir Keir Starmer “unravelling” Brexit, Nigel Farage said “the Tories haven’t done Brexit” so it could be “very easy” for Labour to undo it. Pressed on policy, Mr Farage quipped: “I’m just a journalist working at GB News.” He added the “population crisis” was the biggest issue facing Britain. “Uncontrolled migration into Britain on a level where the pressures that it’s put on the education system, on the health system, are intolerable. They’re intolerable because that level of migration does not bring the national income needed to bring those services up to. “The first thing we have to do is have an honest conversation about the population explosion. We have to stop it, it cannot go on the way it is, given 85 per cent of that rise is down to immigration. It is very unlikely anything will change at all if we continue with our lawmaking bodies being made up in the same way. “Whether you get Rishi back as prime minister or Keir Starmer, the differences are pretty marginal. You have two forms of social democracy, you have a first-past-the-post electoral system that buttresses both sides.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:19PM GMT                                         Farage rules out ‘dream ticket’ with Boris Johnson                    Asked about a “dream ticket” with Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage quipped: “What are we going to agree on? Nothing. In terms of the vote, the centre-Right was reunited in 2019 in the general election, to a huge extent. “That’s when you saw an 80-seat majority. That’s when you saw as you correctly identify that there is a majority for common sense in the country. “Sadly that Conservative Party that was elected to get Brexit done didn’t believe in it.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:18PM GMT                                         Farage: Reform will win more votes than the Tories at next election                    Nigel Farage predicted Reform will get more votes than the Tories at the next election. “Eighty-seat majority, the world at their feet. I helped them do it and look what they’ve done with it. I think Reform will get, with or without me, more votes than the Conservatives at the next election, in terms of numbers. How that transpires in terms of seats is absolutely anybody’s guess. “But I can see the momentum... May 2 is going to be a disaster with the Conservatives, obviously it’s going to be measured at the high point of 2021. There’ll be a leadership contest, Rishi will win, he’ll limp on... There is no good news coming for the Conservatives.” Asked who in the current Tory Party Mr Farage could work with, he said: “Pass. It’s done. The party... It doesn’t matter who they choose as leader, until the party splits or reforms and decides what it is, it doesn’t matter a damn who the leader is. There is no underlying philosophy that unites Conservatives and a lot of this we can put down to Osborne and Cameron who took it down the route of being social democrats, who wanted the Guardian leader writers to like them. And then Boris blowing an 80-seat majority. “If Winston Churchill came back, they still are doomed at the next election.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:15PM GMT                                         Farage: It isn’t possible for Reform to do well at the elections                    It “isn’t even possible” for Reform to do well at the local elections, Nigel Farage has said, insisting it is a “new party” and needs “time to grow”.                      08 Apr 2024-12:14PM GMT                                         Farage: I have three clear options ahead of me                    “I’ve got three very clear options ahead of me and I’m very fortunate to have those options. One of them is stick to doing what I’m doing, I’m enjoying what I’m doing… “I feel I can influence events and change things as I am right now, doing what I’m doing. Staying as I am is a very clear option. Going to America, working with Trump to try to get the western world back on track “Option number three is at 60 I give up my life, I go from a salary of what it is at the minute to zero, I can give it all up, I can surrender all my privacy, I can go back to being the most hated figure in Britain and get back involved in UK politics. “Now they’re the options ahead of me. I’m not saying I won’t do the third option but what I am saying is this will be probably the last big decision that I will take in my career. “This is a massive decision that I haven’t yet made my mind up about.”                      08 Apr 2024-12:08PM GMT                                         Nigel Farage: The Tory Party is ‘a broad church with no religion’                    The live Q&A has begun with Camilla Tominey putting to Nigel Farage that a vote for Reform was a vote for Labour. “Let’s face facts, I mean if Sir John Curtice says it’s 99 per cent certain that Keir Starmer was going to be in Number 10, it’s over for the Conservatives anyway,” he told subscribers.  He called for the Conservatives to be replaced, adding: “What is the Conservative Party? I’m told it’s a broad church, but it’s a broad church with no religion. It doesn’t actually stand for anything.”                      08 Apr 2024-11:54AM GMT                                         Pictured: Nigel Farage arrives at Lunch Hour event with Camilla Tominey                                         08 Apr 2024-11:51AM GMT                                         Who is Nigel Farage?                    Nigel Farage led the UK Independence Party (UKIP) until 2016 and played a pivotal role in campaigning for Britain’s exit from the European Union. He was also a member of the European Parliament, elected in 1999 and remaining there until 2020.  He also had a brief stint as leader of the Brexit Party, set up to campaign for a “clean-break Brexit” ahead of European elections in 2019. The party also campaigned in the UK general election in the same year.  As well as currently holding the position of honorary president of Reform UK, Mr Farage hosts a programme on the GB News channel. Last year, he finished in third place on the reality TV show “I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!”                      08 Apr 2024-11:36AM GMT                                         Watch: Nigel Farage invites subscribers to ask him ‘any question you like’ on Lunch Hour                    Nigel Farage has said that he will discuss “British politics” and “where we’re going” during the Lunch Hour event with The Telegraph.
