   Cummings: Boris and I will never talk again - but I have few regrets i-news May 10, 2024 First Edition  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 8 Length: 2281 words Byline: Jordan Tyldesley Body   For some, Dominic Cummings is a visionary - a true maverick, defender of democracy and intellectual heavyweight who gets things done by defying convention. Many others view him as an arrogant, vindictive Rasputin-like figure who trampled over the constitution and coarsened public life. He enraged people across the nation with his infamous trip to Barnard Castle during lockdown but today has a growing army of supporters prepared to pay £10 a month to read his uncensored thoughts on a Substack blog. What is incontestable is that for a brief period Cummings commanded immense influence as one of the most powerful unelected political figures in the country. His political intuition played a key part in the successful campaign to leave the EU and then helped to "get Brexit done" and win Boris Johnson's Conservatives an 80-seat majority. Now Cummings is stepping up his plans for a venture that he hopes will have a similarly seismic impact on British politics. He wants his Startup Party to step in immediately if the divided Tories are defeated in the general election. And he has used an interview with i - his first with a British newspaper since leaving government in 2020 - to explain why he thinks it will work. He enters the north London pub dressed casually, wearing his trademark baseball cap and headphones, an ink-blotched white T-shirt, sweatpants and trainers. "I was up drinking until 3am," he explains. "With AI people." Despite his reputation for being abrasive - David Cameron reportedly labelled him a "career psychopath" - he is affable and engaging. He asks thoughtful questions and seems genuinely interested in the answers. Much of what makes Cummings interesting is rooted in his disdain for the established order. His journey to this position wasn't straightforward. It began in the late 90s when he worked at Business for Sterling - a campaign against Britain joining the euro - and something switched. "When I first got involved in the euro campaign I had a completely normal vision of politics," he says. "I assumed that lots of MPs were super-smart and super-able. I assumed that they were very interested in policy and government, that they were super-focused on campaigns and communication. And then I worked with them in 1999 and I realised that was all completely untrue." 'MPS ARE NOT INTERESTED IN HOW VOTERS THINK' Many would argue that plenty of MPs are hard-working and make a valuable contribution to their constituencies, politics and the country as a whole. But Cummings is not convinced. "The official story is completely fake," he says. "They're not interested in how government works, they're not even interested in elections or how voters think. They're actually completely absorbed in things like getting peerages and being on the Today programme." Cummings attended a state primary school and was then privately educated at Durham School. Unsurprisingly, for someone who is resistant to rigid frameworks it didn't suit him. "I didn't fit very well with the regimented structure of it: timetables, 'read this, do that'." But it didn't prevent him from winning a place at Oxford University, which he left with a first-class degree in ancient and modern history. Shortly after graduating, Cummings moved to Russia, where he lived from December 1994 until the end of 1996. His face lights up as he describes the experience as "f**king insane". He adds: "Different places and different times in history are the epicentre of mad energy and in 1994 the epicentre of mad energy in the world was Moscow." He helped to set up an airline flying from Samara, in a city in south-western Russia - which as a "closed city", where only residents and authorised personnel were allowed to enter it, had been cut off in the Soviet Union era - to Vienna. But it was unsuccessful and also, because of the business climate in Russia at the time, "a very dangerous business". He's embarked on numerous ventures during his career and his latest endeavour involves plans to establish a new political party dubbed The Startup Party. "The only point of doing it is to do something which is completely different from the other parties," he says. "The Tories now obviously represent nothing except a continuation of the shitshow; higher taxes, worse violent crime, more debt, anti-entrepreneurs, public services failing, immigration out of control. "But Labour, I think, will not alter the ultimate trajectory very much." 'MOST PEOPLE WOULD BACK MY STARTUP PARTY' "If you can bring those two things together then you have something very powerful and very attractive that most people in the country would get behind." But does our first-past-thepost system allow for a new party to break through and become electorally successful? "It's obviously hard, but possible." Wouldn't it require proportional representation? "No, definitely not. History shows it's doable but it happens in response to huge system changes. Historically, wars and pandemics are things that reshape states and financial clashes. "So now we've got all of those things - we've got 2008, we've got war, we've got pandemic. I think the fundamental division is the people in charge of the old system are desperate to say: 'It's not our fault, we've done a good job, we've had bad luck. "The real problem is populists and fascists undermining supporting us by misinformation. Everyone should just start trusting the old systems again and then everyone would be OK.' "And then everyone else can see you're just a bunch of useless charlatans and we're not going to trust you and, in fact, trust is going to keep declining in you for objectively rational reasons. They don't want to face that." Would he like to have been an MP? "No. What's the point in being an MP? The only MP who has real power is the PM. All the other jobs are fake jobs, they can't actually do anything. People often ask me things like: 'What did the foreign secretary think of the Brexit negotiations in 2019?' The answer is, I can't remember and it doesn't matter. It wasn't relevant." There are growing fears among Conservatives still smarting from the local election results that they could be heading for wipeout at the general election. What does he think will happen to the party? "Depends on what Farage does," he says. "If Farage unretires, the Tories could easily be driven down to double-digit seats and then discussions of a Startup Party and replacing them will go from a very fringe idea to being a very mainstream idea." But while the Tory Party constantly frets about Nigel Farage's next move, Cummings says he won't be welcome in The Startup Party. "No. Farage (inset) is basically the same as the MPs. For him, his orientation is towards The Daily Telegraph and the Today programme - that's what he wants, the same as what the other MPs want. The whole point of The Startup Party is to say we're not oriented towards [those], we're oriented towards voters and towards reality and towards people who build." He thinks it's "highly, highly unlikely" that Farage could ever be prime minister. "He has a fundamental limit on his support," he says. 'STARMER'S A DUFF LEADER' Cummings is no more complimentary about a Labour party which he says has a fundamental problem: Sir Keir Starmer. "In lots of ways, Labour's just a carbon copy of the Tories. They've got a duff leader who's shit at politics, can't communicate, doesn't actually have any picture of how he wants to be different. He just wants to be in charge of the broken old institutions and then do what the Civil Service tell him to do all day. "Starmer will be identical to Rishi in that regard. They're riding on the total disintegration of the Tory Party." Cummings says he didn't get "much of an impression of Starmer" when he worked with Johnson. "He was kind of irrelevant," he says. "Ironically, part of the reason why Boris thought he could get away with breaking our deal was him dealing with Starmer. He concluded by the end of July, actually, that this guy is rubbish - so it changed his calculations a lot on government. "After he nearly died [in April 2020] his attitude was: 'Holy shit, the system completely imploded.' The mainstream media killed him, the NHS is f**ked, the economy is f**ked - we need a fast rebuilding process. "So for about six weeks we got a lot done, that's when we built the Vaccine Taskforce and stuff. But then, very quickly, two things happened. One, a lot of the MPs and the media and the Civil Service said to him: 'No, no, no, don't be radical, don't change things. You'll make loads of enemies.' "And secondly, he looked at Starmer and concluded: 'I don't actually need to do anything to win, this guy is totally shit at politics, I will kick the shit out of him in 2024. Why do I have to go along with Dominic's plans, change all of these things that will annoy a whole bunch of the establishment?'" 'BRITAIN IS RUN BY PPE IDIOTS' Does he think power is too concentrated to London? "Yes. I don't think it's a coincidence that when Britain was the most powerful country in the world its domestic politics was extremely decentralised and now that so much is broken we are more centralised than we have ever been in terms of where there's power and money. "If you'd said to people in 1800 or 1900 that all sorts of decisions about what happens in Bolton or what happens in Birmingham and 'Do we build this or not build that?' will be decided by some 27-year-old PPE [Politics, Philosophy and Economics degree] idiot in the Treasury they'd have just thought: 'This is complete madness'. "They would have correctly said: 'Well if that's what the future holds then obviously Britain will be sunk as a global power because that's the sign that we're completely f**ked'. Again though, that's the distinction between the entrepreneur world and Westminster. That world seems completely rational and reasonable in Westminster and saying that all of these 27-year-old PPE people should not be in charge of these things is regarded as a crazy view but outside Westminster it seems like it's obviously true to everyone." 'WE WERE RIGHT ABOUT BREXIT' "If you look at the big arguments that we had in 2016… the dynamics of the EU and the eurozone, the euro is shit, it's institutionally knackered, they can't fix it. The eurozone is economically stagnant. The eurozone is culturally increasingly hostile to science and technology, it's going to massively f**k up everything like biotech. It's going to f**k up AI regulation [and so forth] - and it's got this combination of free movement, can't cope with Islamic nut jobs and growing political extremist parties. I think we were basically right - all those problems have got worse." But, he adds: "The Government has almost entirely not taken advantage of anything, not actually done anything differently. It doesn't make any sense to do Brexit and then sit the way the Tories have done, doing f**k all and basically leaving in place a whole bunch of stupid EU things." Cummings hasn't spoken to Boris Johnson since the day he walked out of No 10 and thinks it's "extremely, extremely unlikely" that they'll ever talk again. Does he have any regrets about helping Johnson become prime minister? "I've got regrets about some of the details of things. But I don't regret in the sense of 'do I now think I wish I'd told him to get lost when he came round to the house in 2019 and said would I go into No 10'. "Do I now wish that I'd said no and stayed retired? No, I don't. I'm glad that we did it. If we hadn't done, then you'd have had that farce carry on, you'd have had that completely broken Parliament, staggering into dealing with Covid, tens of thousands more people would have got killed in the shitshow, possibly [Jeremy] Corbyn as prime minister and some kind of second referendum." His claim to have helped saved thousands from Covid comes despite the many criticisms of the Johnson government's early handling of a pandemic that claimed the lives of more than 200,000 in the UK. But Cummings argues that without his interventions, it would have been worse and so his decision to join the government to get Brexit done was vindicated. "If we hadn't got that solved when we did the whole thing would have got delayed by Covid and then the system would've basically tried to say: 'It's now six years since the vote and Brexit still hasn't happened. Let's just cancel the whole thing.' Which would've been dangerous for trust in democracy," he says. "People would've seen the biggest democratic vote in this country cancelled. So I'm glad and don't have any regrets about that, no." Cummings on Ukraine, page 10 Startup Party Grand plan Dominic Cummings' plans for his new Startup Party have been long in gestation - he has written about the idea several times since he left government in 2020. But now there are signs that, with the next general election imminent, they are being stepped up and that his anti-establishment party - designed to fill a gap left by a defeated and divided Conservative party - could soon be a reality. The party does not exist yet and Cummings has not released any details about important factors, such as its funding, membership and governance. But there are reports he has been using a series of focus groups across the country to get the public's views about the potential for the party. In August, Cummings wrote in his Substack blog that he wants a party focused on reducing immigration, closing tax loopholes for "the 1 per cent," investing in public services and reforming the Civil Service. He wants his Startup Party to step in immediately if the Tories are defeated in the general election Labour has the same problem as the Tories: their MP ranks are filled with obviously useless people Load-Date: May 10, 2024  End of Document
