   How a Tory Red Wall collapse could prompt a lurch to the centre telegraph.co.uk May 7, 2024 Tuesday 10:00 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 1196 words Byline: By Amy Gibbons, Political Correspondent Highlight: Steering party to the Right to counter Reform may have opposite effect if Conservative MPs are wiped out in Brexit-backing areas Body   More than a decade ago, it was pressure from the Right of the Conservative Party that prompted David Cameron to commit to holding a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. Four prime ministers later, Rishi Sunak finds himself with a different headache, albeit in a post-Brexit world. While the burden on his predecessor was intensified by the electoral insurgency of Nigel Farage’s Ukip, the current Prime Minister is attempting to stave off a threat from another Right-wing newcomer,  Reform UK, of which Mr Farage is honorary president. Reform, led by Richard Tice, is vying to snatch the Tory vote  in traditional Labour heartlands with a high proportion of Leave supporters who lent their backing to Boris Johnson in 2019 to “Get Brexit Done”. The result could be a devastating collapse for the Conservatives in the Red Wall. Polling analysis published by The Telegraph  in January caused jitters among Conservative MPs owing to a suggestion that voters’ support for Reform would be the decisive factor in 96 Tory losses. In the short-term, Mr Sunak might be expected to steer his party to the Right in an attempt to allay the fears of MPs on the Tory Right and maintain his grip on voters concerned about issues such as immigration and the culture wars. But come election time , a wipeout of Tory MPs in Brexit-backing areas could arguably trigger an equal and opposite reaction. Are we about to see a renaissance for the centre ground? For now, the pressure from the Right remains. Buoyed by a strong showing in the polls, Mr Tice has already succeeded in recruiting Lee Anderson, the “Red Wall Rottweiler” who was being lined up by No 10 as a “secret weapon for the election”. Hopes of Mr Anderson convincing 2019 Conservative voters to stick with Mr Sunak were shattered when he dramatically quit as deputy Tory chairman in January before quitting the Conservatives altogether in March and pledging his support for Reform. It means that instead of persuading Red Wall voters to back the Tories, he will be encouraging them to take their business elsewhere: the polar opposite of what Mr Sunak had planned.                      The saga was eerily reminiscent of 2014, when Douglas Carswell, a leading Eurosceptic Tory MP, defected to Ukip. He was followed by Mark Reckless, another prominent EU critic, on the eve of the Conservatives’ annual conference. Ten years on, and the parallels are clear. Just as a Tory spokesman warned, when Mr Reckless switched sides, that “a vote for Ukip is a vote for Ed Miliband”, the embattled Prime Minister is telling anyone who will listen that backing Reform is a gift to Sir Keir Starmer. Indeed, Mr Farage said Mr Anderson’s move was “bigger” news than Mr Carswell and Mr Reckless’ bombshell defections. “This is seismic, it’s enormous,” he said. The threat to the Conservatives’ fate is all too obvious to Tory MPs, especially the “2019-ers” who sailed to victory on Mr Johnson’s coattails. As such, the Prime Minister is being urged by the Tory Right to make some drastic changes. In a stark warning to their leader following Mr Anderson’s defection, the New Conservatives, a group of Tory MPs elected in the wake of the Brexit vote, said his plan was failing and told him to “change course urgently”. They called for a “bold new offer” consistent with the “spirit of 2019”, citing lower immigration as a priority for their constituents. The demands offer a glimpse into a looming battle for the soul of the Conservative Party. On the other side of the argument, centrist Tories argue vehemently that Mr Sunak is already catering generously to the Right, despite misgivings among many Right-wingers over his decision to sack Suella Braverman from the Cabinet and bring Lord Cameron back into the fold last year. In September, the Prime Minister watered down Britain’s net zero pledges, delaying the ban on petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035 and weakening the planned phase-out of gas boilers.                      Recommended                    General Election Poll Tracker And in December, he unveiled a major package of measures to slash record levels of net migration, including a big increase in the salary threshold for foreign workers. Philip Davies, the Tory MP for Shipley who is married to Esther McVey, the Minister for Common Sense, argued that Mr Sunak is “pursuing a much more Red Wall policy than Boris ever did”. The issue, he believes, is not with what the Prime Minister is doing for the Right, but how he is communicating it. “Despite the rhetoric, Boris has always been very liberal on immigration,” he said. “Rishi is anything but liberal on immigration. That’s why he’s changed the rules so students can’t bring dependants with them, he’s increased the amount you’ve got to work before you come into the country or sponsor someone to come into the country… he’s pursuing a much more robust policy on immigration than Boris did.” He added: “The issue for Rishi is not what he’s doing-I think he’s doing all the right things… The perception is the problem.” But others think he can do far more. One Right-wing MP said they believe there’s a problem with inertia in No 10 and questioned why Mr Sunak took so long to take his Rwanda Bill through Parliament. They added: “If he wants to win support on the Right of the party, he needs to get one of those flights to take off.” Asked if they thought Mr Sunak would benefit from being more decisive, the MP quipped: “Good luck with that.” A shift to the Right to placate restless MPs with one eye on Reform would suggest that Mrs Braverman, or, in the eyes of some, Kemi Badenoch, would be well positioned to take the reins if Mr Sunakfalls on his sword  after, or even before, the next election. But if there is a collapse in the Red Wall – as expected – many of those in Brexit-backing, former Labour strongholds who are currently seen as a flight risk, or are piling the pressure on Mr Sunak to go further, will lose their seats. So in the event of a Tory defeat, with their influence heavily diluted, could we in fact see a move towards the centre-a reset, of sorts? In this scenario, Penny Mordaunt, a grassroots favourite, would be an obvious choice for leader. She even appears to be popular among Right-wing MPs, who were said to be plotting to install her as Mr Sunak’s replacement. Tom Tugendhat, the security minister who has run for the top job in the past, might also fancy his chances again. From Lord Cameron, to Theresa May, to Mr Johnson, to Liz Truss, to Mr Sunak, with seven different chancellors, 14 party chairmen and two snap elections, the Tories have turned over enough new pages since 2010 to fill a book. It may be that a heavy loss in the Red Wall emboldens the likes of Mrs Braverman and Mrs Badenoch to swing the pendulum further to the Right, with tougher rules on immigration, further concessions on Net Zero and an all-out crackdown on political correctness. But once the dust has settled after the election it may transpire that they simply do not have the numbers needed for a Right-wing candidate to win the vote by MPs on the next leader. For many Conservative MPs on both sides of the ideological divide, the stakes could not be higher. Load-Date: May 7, 2024  End of Document
