   Nigel Farage will stand as an MP at general election — as it happened thetimes.co.uk June 3, 2024 Monday 6:40 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 5619 words Byline: Seren Hughes, Laurence Sleator, Oliver Wright, Max Kendix, Alex Farber, George Sandeman, Steven Swinford Highlight: He will become the leader of Reform and will stand for election in Clacton, Essex Body   Nigel Farage announced today that he is making a return to frontline politics. Earlier, Sir Keir Starmer promised that national security will always come first under Labour, while the Conservatives are pledging to reform gender laws. General election latest: Reform ‘would allow 600,000 migrants into Britain’ Grant Shapps  hung up on a phone call when asked by a journalist live on television whether he had seen that he was projected to lose his seat. The defence secretary rang Sam Coates, Sky News’ deputy political editor, while he was on air explaining the polling model produced by YouGov which showed that Labour was on track to win a historic number of seats. The MRP model also projects that Shapps, who is standing for re-election in Welwyn Hatfield, is among four cabinet ministers predicted to lose their seats if a general election was held tomorrow. Shapps has held the Hertfordshire constituency since entering parliament in 2005 and has been touted as a leadership candidate for the Conservatives should Rishi Sunak resign after the general election. Shapps later gave an interview to the broadcaster in which he said: “I always accept that my seat is at risk, I’ve always thought of it as being marginal. I always fight for every single vote.” The decision by Nigel Farage to stand as an MP is a gift for the Labour Party and he is “doing exactly what Keir Starmer wants him to do,” a Conservative Party spokesman said (George Sandeman writes). The spokesman added: “Nigel Farage risks handing Keir Starmer a blank cheque to rejoin the EU, impose the retirement tax on pensioners and hike taxes on hardworking Brits up and down the UK. “Farage knows that Reform won’t win any seats but he doesn’t seem to care that a vote for Reform only helps Labour. He’s doing exactly what Keir Starmer wants him to do. “Just yesterday, EU insiders openly voiced their expectation that Starmer would seek a softer Brexit deal, opening the door to rejoining the EU all together. That would mean uncontrolled immigration and betraying the will of the British people. “Is Farage really willing to risk undoing his life’s work by handing Starmer a blank cheque to rejoin the EU? Only a vote for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives can deliver a clear plan, bold action and a secure future for our country.” In 2019 Farage, who was then leader of the Brexit party, agreed not to stand candidates in 317 seats won by Tories in order not to split the right-wing vote. He justified it at the time by saying that  Jeremy Corbyn , the then Labour leader, was a threat to national security. By any measure  YouGov’s latest seat-by-seat poll is bad news  for Rishi Sunak. Since calling the general election ten days ago the prime minister has made a series of announcements in an effort to shift the dial, including national service for 18-year-olds, income tax cuts for pensioners and scrapping “Mickey Mouse” degrees (Steven Swinford writes). On paper, the policies individually are popular, especially with the core voters the Tories are trying to target. But YouGov’s latest poll of 53,334 voters suggests that the electorate is not yet responding. On the contrary, the gap in the polls has widened since March and suggests Labour is on course for a victory that will eclipse Tony Blair’s landslide in 1997. Cabinet ministers have warned that such a defeat would be enough to hand Sir Keir Starmer a decade in office. It would represent a generational shift at Westminster. Nigel Farage’s decision to stand in Clacton is rooted in the constituency’s history of electing right-wing politicians (George Sandeman writes). The coastal Essex seat was held by Giles Watling for the Conservatives, but prior to him the incumbent was Douglas Carswell, a Tory MP who defected to Ukip in 2014. Carswell, a well-known Eurosceptic, won the resulting by-election and held the seat at the general election in 2015. Farage was leader of Ukip at the time. Watling took the seat in 2017 although Carswell did not stand for re-election. This will be Farage’s eighth tilt at trying to win a seat in the House of Commons having first tried in 1994 at the Eastleigh by-election. Most recently he stood in South Thanet in 2015 where he earned 32.4 per cent of the vote, finishing second to the Conservatives. In 2019 the MRP methodology, which is a seat-by-seat analysis, was used to predict Boris Johnson’s majority to within a couple of seats of the actual result (George Sandeman writes). It was used in a general election for the first time in 2017 and, in an article for The Times, correctly projected Labour’s surprise increase in seats under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. According to YouGov’s website, the multi-level regression and post-stratification model uses a large sample of polling data to “discover relationships between people’s characteristics and their answers to the voting intention question”. YouGov then combines these relationships “with information about the characteristics of people living in different constituencies to construct estimates of how vote intention would look in each constituency”. Labour could have a majority of 194 seats if an election was held tomorrow, according to a  new polling model by YouGov  that utilises its MRP methodology (George Sandeman writes). It would be the largest election win for 100 years, surpassing the New Labour landslide in 1997 and any Tory win under Margaret Thatcher. The projection showed that Labour would have 422 seats, while the Conservative would be reduced to 140. Nigel Farage said that Reform’s candidate in Clacton knew that he might be replaced (George Sandeman writes). Asked if this announcement was the first Anthony Mack, the candidate, was hearing of Farage’s decision to stand, the former Ukip leader said: “He knew six months ago it was a possibility. “Is my standing in Clacton going to help 600 other candidates? I think it may well do and sometimes tough things have to be done.” According to Reform’s website, Mack has lived in Clacton for several years having spent nearly two decades as a black cab driver in London. Asked in the press conference if his candidacy had been a present for  Sir Keir Starmer , as it would draw votes away from the Conservatives, Farage said many Labour supporters had got behind him over Brexit and when he was leader of Ukip. “I think we’ll draw quite evenly from Labour and the Conservatives,” he said. The press conference has now finished. Penny Mordaunt  and  Angela Rayner , the deputy Labour leader, are due to debate each other in the first seven-way debate of the election campaign on the BBC on Friday (George Sandeman and Ed Halford write). They will both appear alongside Nigel Farage and representatives from the Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party. Mishal Husain will host the show for the BBC, which is due to start at 7.30pm and last for 90 minutes. Rishi Sunak was tasked with the same responsibility during a seven-way debate on ITV in 2019 when he faced off against Nicola Sturgeon, Nigel Farage, Jo Swinson, Richard Burgon, Siân Berry and Adam Price. Nigel Farage  promised Reform UK will be the “voice of opposition” (Seren Hughes and George Sandeman write). Speaking as he announced he is standing at the election, he said: “I intend to lead a political revolt. Nothing in this country works anymore. We are in decline. This will only be turned around with boldness.” He said that a rise in immigration over the past decades of Conservative and Labour government had caused housing problems and a decline in living standards. Farage said: “The population explosion has devalued the life of Britons in the most extraordinary way.”  Before taking questions from the media, he finished his speech by alluding to the successful Brexit referendum he had long campaigned for: “I tell you what, I’ve done it before, I’ll do it again. I’ll surprise everybody.” “We are going to be the voice of opposition,” he said. Farage said he was standing as an MP after meeting many people on the campaign trail who had repeatedly asked why he wasn’t standing. He said he took the day off on Sunday and felt guilty that he wasn’t standing up for people who had become disillusioned with politics and the political class. “I couldn’t help feeling I was letting them down,” he said. He said he would be standing in Clacton, Essex, and would launch his campaign at midday tomorrow. He added: “The election is over, it’s done. Labour have won the election. There is not a contest.” Nigel Farage is standing at the general election in Clacton in Essex, he has announced (Seren Hughes writes). “I’m coming back for the next five years,” he promised. “We know that the Conservative Party will be in opposition. Our aim is to get many millions of votes.” Speaking at a press conference in London this afternoon, Nigel Farage said the election needed “gingering up” and described the campaign so far as dull and boring (George Sandeman writes). In a statement issued shortly after Rishi Sunak called the election last month, Farage said he would help Reform in the campaign — but not as a parliamentary candidate. He tweeted at the time: “I have thought long and hard as to whether I should stand in the upcoming general election. As honorary president of Reform UK I am fully supportive of Richard Tice’s leadership and urge voters to put their trust in him and Lee Anderson [the party’s sole MP]. I will do my bit to help in the campaign, but it is not the right time for me to go further than that.” He also said he wanted to be free to campaign in the US presidential election later this year where Donald Trump is seeking a return to the White House. Nigel Farage will take over as the leader of Reform UK (Seren Hughes writes). Richard Tice, the current leader, announced that he had invited Farage to lead the party and he has accepted. Jeremy Corbyn , the former Labour leader, has called nuclear weapons “a profound and existential threat” after Sir Keir Starmer unveiled a “triple lock” of nuclear deterrence this morning. Labour can be trusted with the country’s national security and intends to increase spending on  defence , a shadow minister has said (George Sandeman writes). Steve McCabe said there should be an “increase in personnel” for the armed forces. He told the BBC: “It is also about ensuring they are properly equipped and they have the right technical abilities for the risk that we face. There’s also a big issue with retention which needs almost as much attention as recruitment.” He added: “We intend to start with the review, it is our intention to increase defence spending, the last time it was 2.5% it was under a Labour government, this Government has cut defence spending, and it’s questionable whether it’s really at 2.3% now because of course we’ve added in pensions.” He said: “I don’t think people need to worry about Labour’s commitment, the only issue is whether or not we are serious about doing this or the government are simply plucking a figure out of thin air, and given their past behaviour over 14 years, it’s hard to believe what they are saying.” McCabe, who is the shadow minister for veterans, is not standing at the general election for his Birmingham, Selly Oak seat. The 68-year-old was first elected to parliament in 1997. There has been a “hollowing out” of defence under governments of both stripes, a former defence secretary has said (Laurence Sleator writes).  Ben Wallace, who was defence secretary until August 2023, said spending 3 per cent of GDP on protecting the country was the only way to combat increasing threats.  The prime minister has said defence spending would be 2.5 per cent by 2030, while Labour has committed to spending 2.5 per cent “as soon as resources allow”.  Speaking to the BBC, Wallace said: ““The threat is rising towards the end of the decade, I would suggest, as others have, that towards the end of the decade we should be spending 3% of GDP.  “Governments didn’t want to pay for defence, they wanted to pose in front of the Red Arrows, and Trooping the Colour, and you know Tony Blair’s government wanted to send the army to the Iraq war, but they didn’t want to really pay for it properly.” The Liberal Democrats have pulled off another election stunt, this time hijacking a Rishi Sunak campaign event in Oxfordshire (Laurence Sleator writes).  As the prime minister spoke with voters over tea and cakes at a riverside rowing club in Henley, Liberal Democrat activists came past on a boat waving their party’s placards.  Following the Lib Dems’ stunt as they crossed paths with the prime minister in Oxfordshire, a Lib Dem source said: “This is just another small boat Rishi Sunak can’t deal with.”  In response Sunak tweeted, “Classic Lib Dems, always selling voters down the river.” Nigel Farage is expected to take part in a BBC debate involving the seven main political parties (Alex Farber writes). The  Reform  president is understood to have been proposed by the party to appear this Friday in the primetime TV debate alongside senior figures from the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats, as well as the SNP, Greens and Plaid Cmyru. The divisive political figure had initially ruled himself out as a Reform candidate for the July 4 election but he has called an “emergency” meeting at 4pm this afternoon, fuelling speculation that he is to change his mind. The anticipated appearance was highlighted by Nick Robinson on the                     Today                     podcast released this afternoon. “In this debate the parties are allowed to choose who they put forward, it doesn’t have to be the party leader, and it looks pretty likely Reform will choose Nigel Farage not Richard Tice,” he said. The seven-way debate will be hosted by Mishal Husain and run for 90-minutes from 7.30pm on BBC1. It is the first flagship event in the BBC’s campaign coverage which will be capped with a head-to-head clash between Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer, hosted by Sophie Raworth, in Nottingham on June 26. Rishi Sunak has said a vote for Nigel Farage is voting to put Sir Keir Starmer in Number 10, amid rumours the honorary president of Reform UK is considering running for parliament (Laurence Sleator writes).  With Farage making an “emergency general election announcement” this afternoon, the prime minister was asked if he fears a comeback from the prominent Brexiteer.  “At the end of the day on July 5th, one of two people will be prime minister, either Keir Starmer or me.  “A vote for anyone who is not a Conservative candidate is just a vote to put Keir Starmer in No 10,” he said. The Labour leader’s speech was far more about presentation than substance (Max Kendix writes).  Its commitment to a “triple lock” of nuclear deterrence — four new nuclear submarines, 24/7 maintenance of Trident and delivering any upgrades needed — has been touted before by Starmer.  But in a museum full of military artefacts from the Lancashire Fusiliers, the line infrantry regiment that fought in Gallipoli and Egypt in the First World War, Starmer was there to park his tanks on the traditional Tory lawn of national security and defence.  His army of ex-military parliamentary candidates were an attempt to show how much the party has changed since Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, though in practice they have a mixed background.  Some like Fred Thomas, who is challenging the cabinet minister Johnny Mercer in Plymouth Moor View, joined the Labour party just last year having left the Royal Marines. Others, though, have been Labour councillors for years and supported Corbyn’s leadership.  Paul Foster served in the British Army for 15 years and is hoping to overturn an 11,000 Conservative majority in South Ribble in Lancashire. But in 2018 he posted a quote from the then-Labour leader, adding “Having experienced conflicts first hand in Iraq and Kosovo, I couldn’t agree with Jeremy more.” Asked about the comments, Foster replied: “I don’t recognise that”.  The Conservative Party has highlighted Sir Keir Starmer’s previous support for Jeremy Corbyn, in response to the Labour leader’s speech on national security (Laurence Sleator writes).  In a speech in Manchester today, Starmer said his commitment to the UK’s nuclear weapons is “absolute” and that defence of the country is the “number one” issue for Labour.  In response to his speech, Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, said: “How can anyone trust Starmer on defence when he tried to make Corbyn prime minister twice?” Tom Tugendhat, the security minister, said: “Keir Starmer backed a man who wanted to remove our nuclear deterrent. Actions speak louder than words.”  Starmer served as shadow Brexit secretary under Corbyn. Sir Keir Starmer continues to face two difficult questions over his commitments to veterans and national security (Max Kendix writes).  The first is how much Labour has changed since five years ago, when 47 of its MPs voted to scrap Britain’s nuclear deterrent. Twelve of those are on Starmer’s front bench today, including the shadow foreign secretary, who said he was following his Christian faith. Starmer said he would lead the party “from the front” and that the shadow cabinet would have to step in line. The second issue is Starmer’s pledge to repeal the Northern Ireland Legacy Act. The Conservative legislation passed last year provides amnesty for crimes committed during the Troubles and is widely backed by British veterans’ groups. Starmer confirmed he will repeal the law, pointing out that the controversial move was not supported by any major political party in Northern Ireland. The Fusilier Museum in Bury has had three visits from prime ministerial candidates: Margaret Thatcher in 1979, Tony Blair in 1997 and, today, Sir Keir Starmer (Max Kendix writes).  The first two became prime minister within a month, and the third hopes to do the same. The Labour leader knows that to win the hearts and minds of the white working class here in Bury North, and across the so-called red wall broken by Boris Johnson in 2019, he must assure them the country would be safe under a Labour government.  Speaking in front of a semicircle of ten veterans now standing as Labour candidates, Starmer pledged that Britain would be “fit to fight” under Labour and would become the “leading European nation in Nato”.  While Starmer answered questions, one of the veterans fainted behind him. He was caught by a bodyguard and sat down with a glass of water. Nigel Farage, the honorary president of  Reform UK , has said he will be making an “emergency general election announcement” at 4pm today.  Last week Farage hinted at a possible deal with the Conservative Party, telling Rishi Sunak: “Give me something back. We might have a conversation.”  He told The Sun’s Never Mind the Ballots: “I got rid of Mrs May with the Brexit Party. I stood aside for Boris to help him win a massive majority. What are they going to do for me?  “Give me something back. We might have a conversation.” Sir Keir Starmer has said reports of private schools closing have “nothing to do with” Labour Party policy on the issue.  Labour has vowed to place VAT on private school fees “straight away” after taking office. Some independent schools have closed, with some blaming this on the prospect of the policy coming in.  Asked about this, Starmer said: “I’ve seen a number of reports of private schools closing but if you look at the details its got nothing to do with Labour Party policy at all.  “In fact I think hundreds of private schools have closed over the past 14 years. It’s about time that was put into the mix.” Sir Keir Starmer has reaffirmed his “absolute” commitment to the UK’s nuclear deterrent and said he would be prepared to use it in certain circumstances (Laurence Sleator writes).  Asked if he would be prepared to authorise a nuclear strike, he said: “It’s fundamental it’s a vital part of our defence and of course that means we have to be prepared to use it. Now nobody who aspires to be prime minister would set out the circumstances in which it would be used that would be irresponsible but it is there as part of vital part of our defence so of course we have to be prepared to use it.”  He said his whole shadow cabinet is “behind” him on this, despite Angela Rayner and David Lammy voting against renewing the nuclear deterrent years ago.  “I lead this party, I’ve changed this party. If we are privileged to serve I will serve as the prime minister of the UK.” A “new age of insecurity has begun”, Sir Keir Starmer has said as the Labour leader outlined his party’s pledges on national security (Laurence Sleator writes).  Speaking at a campaign event at the Fusilier Museum in Bury, Starmer said: “The postwar era is over and a new age of insecurity has begun an era where the burden of history for people and nations will once again be heavier on our backs. National security is the most important issue of our times.”  He attacked the Tories for questioning Labour’s commitment on defence: “Throughout the whole of this parliament I deliberately have not been partisan over issues of national security but just before election the Tories questioned this Labour party commitment to national security and I will not let that stand. The people of Britain need to know we will keep them safe.”  He paid tribute to D-Day veterans and serviceman of the UK, mentioning his mother’s brother — “Uncle Roger” — who served in the Falklands. With all three main political parties up and running with their election battle buses, the Tories’ bus was previously used to transport Oxford United’s winning team around the country (Ed Halford writes).  It is ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) compliant and emblazoned across the bus is the party’s election slogan: “Clear plan, bold action, secure future”.  The Labour Party’s bus features their general election slogan “Change” more than 30 times and is also Ulez compliant.  The Liberal Democrat’s bus, Yellow Hammer 1, was unveiled in Whittlesford near Cambridge and is branded with the slogan “Liberal Democrats for a fair deal”. John Healey, who would probably be defence secretary in a Labour government, says Sir Keir Starmer would do “what is required, if it is required.”  Speaking to                     Today                    , Healey was asked if his leader would authorise a nuclear strike: “The importance about a deterrent is there is a deliberate ambiguity and Keir Starmer has said ‘I will do what is necessary to defend this country’ and that is an important message to any would-be adversaries.”  Asked again, he said: “No one should doubt Keir Starmer… he knows what needs to be done to protect this country, he will do what is required, if it is required.” The polling company YouGov is set to release its significant multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP) model later today (Laurence Sleator writes).  The model was the first to point to Theresa May losing the Conservative Party’s majority in 2017 — including shock results such as in Kensington and Chelsea — and said a Conservative majority was likely in 2019.  It will point to the size of any party’s victory, the makeup of the House of Commons and which big names could lose their seats.  MRP works by taking polling data and adding to it census-type data to estimate opinion at a local level. A study undertaken in April said that Labour were projected to win over 400 seats. Until today Kemi Badenoch had largely kept a low profile in this election campaign (writes Oliver Wright).  Now with characteristic forthrightness she has thrust herself front and centre of an issue which the Tories hope will win votes on July 4.  For Badenoch campaigning on a pro-women’s rights platform is a sweet spot.  She is not having to be the face of an unpopular government defending its record on the cost of living or NHS waiting times.  Instead she is campaigning on an issue that she both personally believes in and knows is widely popular with at least one electorate.  That electorate is not the one that goes to the polls next month — but the one who is likely to vote in a few months time to choose a new Conservative leader if the party loses this election.  Unlike some leadership contenders Badenoch is largely loyal to Downing Street. But nevertheless all those who are vying to succeed Sunak have one eye on what happens afterwards.  And one of the interesting things about this campaign is watching how they use it to position themselves for what comes next. A row over a podcast appearance by the former prime minister Liz Truss has been dismissed as “trivial” and “unserious” by a Conservative cabinet minister (Laurence Sleator writes).  Kemi Badenoch was asked if it was appropriate for Truss to appear on a podcast hosted by Carl Benjamin, who once tweeted “I wouldn’t even rape you” at a Labour MP.  Badenoch described those comments as inappropriate but said it was “wrong” for presenters to decide which shows candidates go on.  “Carl Benjamin is not standing for election, Liz Truss is. It is for her constituents to decide whether she’s done a good job or not,” she told the BBC. “It is not for you or me for that matter to decide which shows she should be able to go on because the presenter may have said something inappropriate before.  “I think it is trivial, it is unserious; I am here talking about what we are doing to protect vulnerable women.” The Conservatives are seeking to clarify the Equality Act, not change it, Kemi Badenoch has said (writes Oliver Wright).  Speaking to Sky News, the equalities minister said it was “re-emphasising what should be the status quo”.  “We have seen quite a lot of changes in terms of terminology in the law. Sex and gender we used interchangeably, now we don’t do that, so what we’re doing is making sure people understand what the law says. We have seen a lot of problems with people misinterpreting the law,” she said.  Asked why she didn’t bring this forward before the general election, Badenoch said she had been working on this policy, adding: “The biggest reason is because of what Scotland was doing with its Gender Recognition Bill.”  Badenoch said that transgender athletes would not be “stopped from competing” in sports but will in some cases compete alongside their biological sex.  Labour has dismissed Conservative plans to define “sex” as biological in the eyes of the law to protect female-only spaces like changing rooms and lavatories (writes Oliver Wright).  John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, said the proposals were “not needed”.  His comments put clear a dividing line between Labour and the Tories on the contentious issue and will be seized on by the Conservatives to suggest that the opposition is not committed to women’s rights.  Speaking on                     BBC Five Live                     Healey said: “This is an election distraction from the really core issues that matter to people like the cost of living and the defence of the country,” he said.  “The Equality Act, which Labour brought in in 2010 and the Tories opposed, already protects single sex spaces for biological women. It already defines what a woman is. What’s certainly needed is clearer guidance and for service providers about how to safeguard those women.  Donald Trump has thanked Boris Johnson for supporting him after the former US president was convicted of fraud by a New York jury last week (Laurence Sleator writes).  The former prime minister, who enjoyed good relations with Trump during his time in office, described the criminal conviction as a “machine gun mob-style hit job”.  Writing in his column in the Daily Mail, Johnson said: “It was nakedly political. It was completely artificial.  “The vast mass of American voters could see what I believe was really happening: that the liberal elites were just appalled at Trump’s continuing popularity and his ability to connect with voters — and they were using anything they could find to derail his campaign. That is why the anti-Trump lawfare is backfiring.”  Trump copied the words to his Truth Social social media platform and wrote: Thank you Boris Johnson!” Kemi Badenoch, the business and trade secretary, has been involved in a terse exchange with a journalist this morning as she announced planned changes to the Equality Act (Laurence Sleator writes).  Writing in The Times this morning , the Conservative candidate for North West Essex said if her party wins power on July 5 she wanted to clarify so that “sex” can only mean biological sex.  She was asked about her article this morning by the Sky News presenter Kay Burley, who said: “I read your piece and there are obviously extremes and those people need to be protected.  Badenoch replied: “Extremes? What do you mean by extremes?  “Well, you tell me what you actually meant by your article?” Burley said.  “I didn’t write anything about extremes. I’m just asking what you mean,” Badenoch said.  “I do the questions if you don’t mind.”  “I didn’t understand the question.” Diane Abbott has confirmed that she is planning to stand as Labour’s candidate for Hackney North & Stoke Newington as she denied that she had been offered a peerage. On Friday Sir Keir Starmer said that Abbott would be “free” to stand for Labour following a shadow cabinet backlash over plans that would, in effect, bar her from standing. Abbott confirmed on Sunday evening that  she was standing for Labour : “I have never been offered a  seat in the Lords , and would not accept one if offered. I am the adopted Labour candidate for Hackney North & Stoke Newington. I intend to run and to win as Labour’s candidate.” The Sunday Times has claimed that a number of former Labour MPs, including Abbott, have been offered peerages to quit the Commons and open up seats for allies of Starmer. Wes Streeting said that only Labour has a plan to deliver change for the NHS, as the Royal College of Nursing declared a national emergency over corridor care.  The shadow health secretary said: “NHS nurses are sounding the alarm on the appalling state of the NHS after 14 years of Conservative neglect.  “Patients and staff alike can see that the NHS is broken. Only Rishi Sunak and his party won’t acknowledge that the crisis in the NHS is a national emergency, and if they can’t diagnose the illness then how can they be trusted to cure it.  “The NHS is crying out for change and only Labour has a plan to deliver it.” The Lib Dems have vowed to have the “boldest manifesto on cleaning up our rivers and coastlines” as they announce plans for a new protected status for rivers.  New Blue Flag rivers would have legally binding targets to prevent sewage dumping and be given special protected status for swimmers and wildlife.  The party said the government’s bathing water scheme has failed to protect waterways from sewage discharges by only requiring increased water quality testing. Lib Dem analysis has found that water companies have discharged sewage into bathing water areas 105,347 times since 2020.  The Lib Dems are also announcing  the expansion of Marine Protected Areas to cover at least 50% of the UK territorial waters by 2030.  The party has already declared plans to abolish Ofwat, introduce a new regulator with greater powers, and ban water company executive bonuses. The second debate between Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will be held by the BBC on June 26, the corporation has announced. Sophie Raworth will host the  election  debate in Nottingham and it will be broadcast at 9pm on BBC One and BBC News. The first debate between the two leaders will be hosted by ITV on Tuesday. Sunak and Starmer’s lines of attack for first TV debate Mishal Husain will also host a debate between leading figures from the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and Reform UK at 7.30pm on June 7 in London. A two-hour long                     Question Time                     special with the leaders of the four biggest parties, hosted by Fiona Bruce, will be broadcast at 8pm on June 20.                    Key election dates —                    from debates to manifestos The Conservatives have pledged to change the Equality Act to define “sex” as biological. The party says the change will help for service providers for women and girls to prevent biological males from taking part. Rishi Sunak said: “The safety of women and girls is too important to allow the current confusion around definitions of sex and gender to persist.” The change to the law will not remove the existing and continuing protections against discrimination on the basis of gender reassignment provided by the Equality Act, the Tories have promised.  The sex of those with a Gender Recognition Certificate will still align with their acquired gender in law outside the Equality Act.  Read Oliver Wright and Steven Swinford’s story plus Kemi Badenoch’s comment for The Times Labour has reaffirmed its commitment to a nuclear deterrent triple lock. The pledge will see the construction of four new nuclear submarines, Britain maintaining its continuous at-sea deterrent, and the delivery of all future upgrades needed for those submarines. Sir Keir Starmer said the triple lock would support thousands of high-paying jobs across the UK. The  Labour  leader will be joined today by John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, and will meet former forces personnel and Labour candidates. “No longer the party of protest, Labour is the party of national security,”  Starmer  said, as he continues to set himself apart from his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn, a long-standing critic of Trident. Labour has selected 14 ex-military candidates including Al Carns, a former colonel in the Royal Marines; Louise Jones, a former intelligence officer for the army; and Calvin Bailey, a former commanding officer in the Royal Air Force.
