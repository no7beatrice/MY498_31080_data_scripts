   Brexit drove me to vote SNP, admits former Labour leader Kezia Dugdale thetimes.co.uk February 4, 2024 Sunday 6:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 658 words Byline: David Leask, Kieran Andrews Highlight: Ex-MSP had been a leading voice in the Better Together campaign in 2014 but was turned off by ‘Little Boris Brexit Britain’ Body   A former leader of Scottish Labour has admitted voting for the SNP because she was “so mad about Brexit”. Kezia Dugdale has previously suggested that her support for unionism has waned since she was a key Better Together voice in the 2014 independence referendum. Now, in a new BBC Radio 4 documentary,  the former Labour MSP  has revealed she once cast her ballot for her one-time arch-rivals to protest against Britain leaving the European Union. “I voted SNP once in my life and that was in the European Union elections immediately after Brexit, where I was so mad about Brexit, I wanted to register a vote for them. And for that reason alone,” Dugdale said. “I felt I could vote for the SNP in that European Union election, because that in no way could be construed as a vote for independence.  “I felt that that was a safe thing to do. I voted Labour in every election since then; from the council to the Scottish parliament to the general election, I have used a vote for Labour.” The  European parliament elections of May 2019  were held when the UK was still in the EU but on its way out and just a few weeks before Dugdale resigned from the Scottish parliament. Labour lost both its Scottish European seats, taking just 9.3 per cent of the vote.  There has long been speculation that Dugdale — now in academia and married to the  SNP education secretary Jenny Gilruth  — was flirting with Scottish independence.  Dugdale, however, stressed last year that she did not think the big constitutional question was going to be put to the vote any time soon.  She signalled that her preferences would depend on the circumstances if and when there was a second referendum. “If you are presented with a binary choice between an independent Scotland in a progressive Europe or Little Boris Brexit Britain, I know where my cards would fall down,” she said. “I also know I couldn’t argue with the same strength for the Union that I did in 2014 now. That doesn’t mean I’m ready to vote Yes; there are big, big questions we need to debate as a country and resolve. “So I have moved … We have to keep talking about some of these big issues in the country, but not just purely through that Yes-No lens.” Dugdale, 42, who was leader for two years from 2015 to 2017, is no longer involved in party politics but her latest remarks come as her old party attempts to lure pro-independence Scots away from the SNP. The new documentary, called                     Labour’s Scottish Challenge                    , will be broadcast on Monday evening and reveals  Labour believes 28 Scottish seats are “in play”  at the next Westminster election. Anas Sarwar , Dugdale’s latest successor as Scottish Labour leader, tells the programme: “The tipping point in Scotland is around 35 per cent — if we get around 35 per cent in the polls then we are in competition to beat the SNP.  “If I said that to anybody two and a bit years ago, they would have thought I was deluded. But I have always believed that’s what we can do.” A survey in last week’s Sunday Times showed  Labour edging away from the SNP , with its three-point lead being the party’s biggest since the independence referendum. Sarwar’s party is on 36 per cent, according to Norstat, just over what he sees as the tipping point. Humza Yousaf struck an upbeat tone in the documentary. “I don’t fear a general election at all,” the  first minister and SNP leader  told the BBC. “I see it as a huge opportunity. There’s no getting away from the fact that 2023 was a difficult year.”  Yousaf added: “I’m not going to treat you or your listeners as fools … but the general election presents an opportunity, because ultimately a general election will be and should be a battle of ideas. And I think the SNP is strongest when it’s talking about policy.” Mhairi Black, the outgoing Nationalist MP, tells the same programme she thinks her party should back Labour in a King’s Speech only in return for the right to hold a second independence referendum.
