   Calls to strip Fujitsu of £355m Brexit border contract over Post Office scandal unless it pays up telegraph.co.uk January 12, 2024 Friday 6:31 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 649 words Byline: By James Crisp, Europe Editor, Joe Barnes, BRUSSELS CORRESPONDENT, Nick Gutteridge, Whitehall Correspondent Highlight: MPs demand tech firm responsible for Horizon IT loses lucrative deal to run trade channels in Irish Sea unless it compensates postmasters Body   Fujitsu should be stripped of its £355 million contract running the Brexit border in the Irish Sea unless it pays compensation to postmasters  over the Horizon IT scandal , senior politicians have said. That bill is likely to run to millions of pounds after Rishi Sunak announced plans on Wednesday to exonerate postmasters  after “one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation’s history”, and ministers urged Fujitsu to pay up. The Japanese multinational led a consortium that won the lucrative government contract  in 2020 for the Trader Support Service (TSS), an IT and advice system which helped companies move goods from Britain into Northern Ireland after Brexit. The TSS is the largest single outlay of taxpayer’s money on post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland, and one of Fujitsu’s near-200 deals with the Government, which are worth £6.8 billion. The contract for running the free-to-use TSS was extended in 2023  until the end of 2024. Fujitsu is also in the running for a £180 million contract to streamline UK post-Brexit trade through a “Single Trade window.” Politicians in London and Belfast want any further deals frozen until Fujitsu agrees to contribute to the compensation package for postmasters. The inquiry into the scandal is currently being held in London. “There needs to be accountability,” Lord Dodds , a DUP peer, told The Telegraph. He said it was scandalous to make a “tidy profit” out of the contentious Brexit border at the same time as not paying compensation.  The DUP has boycotted power-sharing in Stormont for the past 23 months over the Irish Sea border, which introduced checks and controls on British goods. It was created to prevent a hard land border with EU member Ireland after Brexit, which it was feared could put the peace process at risk.                      Red and green lanes                    The DUP boycott continued despite the Windsor Framework , which was agreed in February 2023 by the UK and EU to replace the Northern Ireland Protocol. That deal introduced red and green lanes to reduce the border checks , which Fujitsu now facilitates through the TSS. Doug Beattie  is the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, which had reservations about the Irish Sea border but has urged the DUP to return to Stormont. “As a Northern Irish politician, I am concerned that this discredited company now has an important part to play in delivering the Windsor Framework red and green lanes. That contract should now be reviewed  and their work on this peer assessed,” he said. “The £340 million contract should not be renewed in 2024 if they do not play their part in delivering compensation to those affected sub-postmasters.” Leading Brexiteers also called on the Government to heap pressure on Fujitsu to pay up. Former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said: “Fujitsu has earned billions in UK government contracts. It is now time for pressure to be applied.” David Jones, a former cabinet minister and Tory MP, said, “I don’t believe that they should have any such contracts. That would include the Northern Ireland contract.”                      ‘No question of further contracts’                    Mark Francois, the chairman of the European Research Group of conservative MPs, said, “Until all sub-postmasters have been fully compensated, there should be no question of awarding any further government work to Fujitsu.” A Fujitsu spokesman said: “Out of respect for the inquiry process , it would be inappropriate for Fujitsu to comment further at this time.” It is expected that the TSS will continue beyond the end of 2024 after the signing of the Windsor Framework. The green lane is set to be expanded from October. This will mean increased traffic and the need for continued support from schemes like the TSS, industry sources said. The Telegraph understands there have been no major issues with the TSS IT system, unlike with Horizon.  Load-Date: January 12, 2024  End of Document
