   Starmer admits ‘mistakes’ after CPS criticised for pursuing postmasters telegraph.co.uk January 18, 2024 Thursday 5:27 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:2 Length: 863 words Byline: By Josh White Highlight: Labour leader insists he has ‘no skeletons in the closet’ as he faces questions over his role in the Post Office scandal Body   Sir Keir Starmer admitted he made “mistakes” when he led the Crown Prosecution Service but insisted he had “no skeletons in the closet” as he faces questions over his role in the Post Office scandal.  The Labour leader was Director of Public Prosecutions between 2008 and 2013 and the CPS has admitted that it was involved in 11 prosecutions that were brought over issues linked to the Horizon IT system. Three of them resulted in convictions. The faulty computer system is blamed for the wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters  in one of the worst miscarriages of justice  in British history. The CPS has declined to say if the cases took place while Sir Keir was in charge of the organisation  and he has insisted he was unaware of the cases which he said had not crossed his desk during his tenure. Speaking on Keir Starmer: Up Close-Tonight, which airs on ITV1 on Thursday, Sir Keir said there is no “smoking gun” over his role in the cases and suggested questions over his knowledge of the prosecutions  were part of the nature of attacks from political opponents. “Look there, it’s going be personal. That’s never pleasant,” he said.  “But if they want to attack me for decisions when I was Director of Public Prosecutions . . . we had 7,000 staff, we made nearly a million decisions a year.  “Will there be mistakes there? Of course there will. But there’ll be no smoking gun, no skeletons in the closet.” Sir Keir, who opinion polls suggest is likely to be the next prime minister , has faced calls to explain his role in the prosecutions and to apologise to victims and their families. Labour has said Sir Keir had no knowledge of the cases and is “calling for swift exoneration and compensation for the victims”. It comes as current and former employees of Fujitsu – the multi-billion pound firm that produced and maintained the defective Horizon software – are giving evidence to the inquiry into the scandal. On Wednesday, the inquiry heard that Fujitsu staff said they feared being “hauled over the coals” after realising the Post Office had used “manipulated” audit data to criminally investigate sub-postmasters.                      ‘I served Corbyn – but I never thought he’d win’                    Sir Keir also admitted he never thought Jeremy Corbyn would win the 2019 general election and only served in his shadow cabinet to stop Conservative Brexit plans.  He said he did not vote for his predecessor but continued in his position as Shadow Brexit Secretary because he felt a “responsibility” to be involved in deciding how Britain would leave the European Union. Sir Keir declined to answer whether he wanted Mr Corbyn to be prime minister, but said: “I didn’t think the Labour Party was in a position to win the last election.” He added: “I didn’t, obviously, vote for Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 or 2016. On the contrary, I resigned.” Sir Keir quit as Shadow Minister for Immigration in 2016 in protest at Mr Corbyn’s leadership but later that year took a new post with the Brexit brief that he held for four years. He said he felt a “responsibility” to take up the role and frustrate Tory Brexit policy. During this time he advocated a second referendum on the Britain’s EU membership. “I thought that once that 2016 Brexit referendum had happened, I took the view that what then followed in the next few years was going to be felt for generations,” Sir Keir said. “And that I thought it was my responsibility to play a full part in that.” Labour endured a disastrous defeat in 2019 and since winning the leadership election in 2020 , Sir Keir has moved the party to the Right  and distanced himself from the politics of Mr Corbyn.  He is on course to be the next prime minister with opinion polls predicting a Labour majority  at the next election, which is set to come this autumn. If he wins power, Sir Keir said he is unlikely to be as bold as Tony Blair, the last Labour leader to win a general election, because he would be inheriting a “terrible situation” from the Tories. Sir Keir echoed comments from Rachel Reeves, the Shadow Chancellor, that a Labour government had no intention of taxing top earners and redistributing wealth to the less well-off. “That isn’t how I want to grow the economy,” Sir Keir told ITV. “Of course I believe in redistribution, but I don’t think redistribution is the, sort of, one-word answer for millions of people across the country. “We shouldn’t be saying to them: ‘I’m sorry, we can’t, we don’t have the ambition for you to have that kind ofjob where you are. So I’m afraid it’s just redistribution.’ I think that that fundamentally disrespects individuals.” Ms Reeves hinted to The Telegraph  at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday that Labour would cut taxes for high earners in a bid to go for economic growth. Despite his recent praise of former Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, he also told ITV he believes she tore communities apart. “What she did was a clarity of mission and purpose. But actually what she did was very destructive,” he said. The Labour leader previously wrote for The Telegraph  that Mrs Thatcher sought to “drag Britain out of its stupor by setting loose our natural entrepreneurialism”.
