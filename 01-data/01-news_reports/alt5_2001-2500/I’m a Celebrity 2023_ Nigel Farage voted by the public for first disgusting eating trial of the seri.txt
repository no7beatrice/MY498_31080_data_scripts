   I’m a Celebrity 2023: Nigel Farage voted by the public for first disgusting eating trial of the series The Independent (United Kingdom) November 19, 2023 Sunday 1:05 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS,TV & RADIO,CULTURE; Version:29 Length: 3646 words Byline: Ellie Muir Highlight: ITV’s reality competition returns to screens tonight Body   The return of I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! is upon us. The reality series has returned to screens last night, with the second episode of the 2023 season airing tonight (20 November) at 9pm on ITV.   Viewers will get to know new crop of celebrities decamping to the Australian outback in the hopes of being crowned this year’s King or Queen of the Jungle.  All eyes will undoubtedly be on former Ukip and Brexit party MEP Nigel Farage  who, following in the footsteps of disgraced politician Matt Hancock  last year, is among the stars who have entered the jungle.  Farage is joined by This Morning’s Josie Gibson , Jamie Lynn Spears , and YouTuber Nella Rose. You can find the full line-up of 2023 campmates here.  It is no surprise that the politician-turned-GB News presenter was voted by the public to take part in the first disgusting eating trial of the series. Tonight, we will see just how much he will eat to win stars for camp... In a preview clip of tonight’s episode, Farage and YouTuber Rose take part in the “Jungle Pizzeria” challenge. The politician is served a “Margar-teat-a” – a pizza topped with a camel udder, a sheep udder and the teat of cow served on a layer of creamy cheese. Farage tucks into the pizza and remarks that the texture is “tough” as Rose, who is sitting across from him, squirms and shouts “Farage!”.  The politician-turned-GB News presenter previously said that he would not be able to take part in some of the bushtucker trials due to health problems  resulting from a 2010 plane crash.                       I’m a Celeb airs every night except Saturdays at 9pm on ITV1 and ITVX.

The public have voted for the campmates to do the next trial tomorrow night...                    The public has decided that YouTube star Nella Rose will face the next bushtucker trial alone, meaning that she has been selected by the public twice in a row... The challenge is called “No time to cry” and it seems as though it entails lots of crawling underground...                      Buffalo tail is on the menu for dinner...                    It’s Fred Sirieix’s time to show us his cooking skills...                      Voting is now closed!                    We will find out the results very soon...

Marvin Humes makes his first appearance in the episode and he’s singing...                    Those JLS days are coming in handy for Marvin Humes as he sings Mario’s “Let Me Love You” to Jamie Lynn Spears to cheer her up. Cute bonding moment.                      Jamie Lynn Spears is feeling emotional                    The homesickness is kicking in for Jamie Lynn Spears. “I’m just tired and I miss my kids,” she told the diary camera in a tearful moment. The other campmates offered to run her a bath to make her feel better...                      Nigel Farage eats four types of animal penis, including pig penis....                    ‘This would not be the top of the list,” says Farage as he unflinchingly finishes off the pizza slice...                      Surströmming – fermented sea herring – puts Nella Rose off her food                    Nella Rose has decided to give in when she was faced with fermented sea herring... Farage is still in the competition                       Nigel Farage eats a mixture of different animal feet and Nella Rose has to eat pig’s anus                    It gets worse....                      Nella Rose says ‘no one’s ever gonna marry me after this’ after she eats a cow’s anus...                    Nigel Farage says “Go on girl” as Nella Rose eats the disgusting dish that is a cow’s anus on pizza... After finishing the slice, Rose says: “No one’s ever gonna marry me after this!”                      Now for the “Marga-teat-a"                    The former Ukip  leader, 59, has been served a “Margar-teat-a” – a pizza topped with a camel’s udder, a sheep’s udder and the teat of cow, served on a layer of cream cheese. Farage asks hosts Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly if they prepared the meal themselves before tucking into the grisly concoction.                      Nella Rose has to eat scorpions and mealworms... on pizza                    Nella Rose gags as she eats the first bite...

Nigel Farage gets political about Boris Johnson and buts heads with Fred Sirieix about Brexit                    It was only a matter of time before things got political at camp... “What’s he like at a personal level?” asks Josie Gibson about the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. “Entertaining, surprisingly introverted,” said Farage. “He’s one of the most disorganised human beings that ever lived... b***** chaos...shambles,” he said. “What’s the benefit of Brexit?” Fred Sirieix jumps in, adding that he thought a level of “intolerance” was encouraged by the Brexit campaign.  “I thought it was shameful what you did Nigel,” said Fred, adding that the original UKIP campaign was “dehumanising” towards migrants. Nigel defended his stance, suggesting that there are “benefits” to Brexit, before other campmates, including Grace Dent, escaped the heated conversation to wash up the dishes instead.                      Jamie Lynn Spears says she and her sister ‘love each other’ despite fallouts and opens up about becoming a mother aged 16                    In a heart-to-heart moment with First Dates star Fred Sirieix, Jamie Lynn Spears opened up about her relationship with her sister Britney and their family.  “All we did growing up was sing and dance,” Lynn Spears said of her childhood, admitting that she and Britney still “love each other” despite difficulties in their relationship. Opening up further, Lynn Spears spoke about giving birth to her daughter Maddie when she was aged 17.  “I got pregnant when I was young and the whole world was like ‘you’re a s***.’” “I had to hide away for a long time,” she said, before explaining that she moved to Mississippi to get away from the press attention.  “When I first got pregnant, they didn’t want me to have a baby,” she said, breaking down into tears before clarifying that “they” meant “everyone around me”.  “When I got out, I told my parents I was gonna emancipate them,” she said of her relationship with her parents. However, the Zoey 101 star said she’s proud of how far she has come. “I’m proud of where I’m at right now,” she said. “I’m really thankful.” Britney Spears is ‘working to feel more compassion’ for sister Jamie Lynn                      Josie Gibson gets a fright when she accidentally sees Farage in the shower...

In scenes that will air on Monday night (20 November), the former Ukip  and Brexit party leader, 59, is served a “Margar-teat-a” – a pizza topped with a camel’s udder, a sheep’s udder and the teat of cow, served on a layer of cream cheese.

With the series set to return, many viewers have been left wondering what the prize for winning the series is. Unfortunately for the contestants, there is no cash prize for winning I’m a Celebrity. Instead, they are simply named King or Queen of the Jungle (or King or Queen of the Castle, as was the case for the two years that the series decamped to Wales due to the pandemic).

I’m a Celebrity launch loses two million viewers after ‘Nigel Farage boycott’                                         I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! might be about to lose its crown as the most-watched show on TV, with the 2023 launch episode  losing a huge number of viewers on last year. The reality series is usually a ratings winner for ITV , pulling in an average of nine to 11 million viewers  throughout each series. However, the 2023 premiere, which saw a new crop of stars enter Australian jungle , had an audience peak of 7.8 million, and an average of just 7 million. This was down from the peak of 10 million, and average of 9.1 million, who watched the launch episode in November 2022, and viewers are attributing the severe dip to the inclusion of controversial ex-politician Nigel Farage.

It will come as little surprise to learn that the public has voted for Nigel Farage to do the first disgusting eating trial of the series tonight.  Ominously titled “Jungle Pizzeria”, it’s safe to say pepporoni and cheese will not be on the menu tonight.  Joining him in the challenge will be Nella Rose.                       What time is I’m a Celeb on tonight?                    The second episode of the 2023 series – which features the first eating trial of the season – will air on ITV and ITVX at 9pm tonight (Monday 20 November).                       07:00 , Annabel Nugent Nigel Farage’s appearance on the programme has courted controversy, especially after last year’s line-up welcomed disgraced politician Matt Hancock.  It’s an unsettling sign of the times, writes Ellie Harrison.  I’m a Celebrity has become a dystopian rehab for disgraced politicians                      Does the winner get any prize money?                    Unfortunately for the contestants, there is no cash prize for winning I’m a Celebrity. Instead, they are simply named King or Queen of the Jungle (or King or Queen of the Castle, as was the case for the two years that the series decamped to Wales due to the pandemic). The stars are, however, paid a set fee to appear on the show. This amount varies from contestant to contestant – depending on how in-demand and famous they are.                       Meet the campmates...

The ITV reality series is broadcast every night on ITV and ITVX at 9pm – except for Saturdays.                       How long is an episode of I’m a Celeb?                    Tonight’s episode was particuarly long, running for 105 minutes. Typical episodes, however, are expected to be 60-minutes long.                       02:00 , Annabel Nugent The contestants were put through the wringer, having to complete not one but two challenges in the first episode.  Here’s Nigel Farage and Nella Rose getting up close and personal with some slippery, slithery reptiles.

Sunday 19 November 2023 22:40 , Annabel Nugent Jamie-Lynn told campmates that with acting, she “loves to play someone people are meant to hate but they end up liking”.  Given the controversy surrounding her relationship with sister Britney Spears, it seems that perhaps Nigel Farage isn’t the only one seeking to rehabilitate their image on I’m A Celeb.

Sunday 19 November 2023 22:14 , Annabel Nugent “It was just... very disgusting,” says Nella in what must be the understatement of the century.  The challenge had successful outcome, though, with the trio winning seven tokens for seven more minutes for their campmates.                       Sunday 19 November 2023 22:12 , Annabel Nugent That is some suspiciously grey sludge Nigel and Nella are wading through right now...

Joining Nick and Marvin is Jamie-Lynn Spears – actor, singer and, of course, sister to Britney Spears.                       Meet Nick Pickard                    “I’m like a dustbin,” says soap royalty Nick Pickard, who is most apprehensive about the food situation at camp – namely the scarcity of it.                       Next up...                    ... is self-confessed acrophobic Marvin Humes.  Marvin, 38, originally found fame as part of boyband JLS on The X Factor in 2008, with the group finishing in second place. After splitting in 2013, the band reformed in 2019 and have just completed a tour.

Aw, Grace shouting out support for Sam. I’d barely be able to speak.                       Anyone else haunted by this image?
