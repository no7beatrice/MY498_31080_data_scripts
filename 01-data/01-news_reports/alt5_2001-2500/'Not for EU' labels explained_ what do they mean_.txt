   'Not for EU' labels explained: what do they mean? standard.co.uk January 11, 2024 Thursday 1:24 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: UK,NEWS; Version:1 Length: 571 words Byline: Tamara Davison Highlight: The 'Not for EU' label on food packaging is causing concern among some British supermarket shoppers Body   As if Brexit  wasn't enough of a reminder, it looks like policymakers are eager to underscore how isolated our isles (or, in this case, aisles) really are. The latest in focus: food packaging.  Some Brits have been confused by the wording "Not for EU " appearing on the labels of some food items in local stores and supermarkets.   Forming part of the Windsor Framework agreed upon between the UK and the EU, the post-Brexit  wording is designed to stop food products from ending up in the European Union.  However, the labelling has left some shoppers questioning whether UK food items are of a lower standard than their EU counterparts.  So, let's take a look at what this new label really means.                                              What do the labels mean?                                         The "Not for EU" labels  have been introduced on some products that move between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The labels are meant to stop produce from crossing into EU regions, such as the Republic of Ireland, from Northern Ireland.  It's all connected to the red tape that has emerged due to Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol.  Due to differing food regulations between Great Britain and the EU, authorities had to think of a way to ensure the passage of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. They had to do this without jeopardising the unique customs setup between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  One of the results was the Windsor Framework, which established a 'green lane' that could reduce red tape on products crossing the Irish Sea. This led to the agreement for "Not for EU" labelling.  Social media has since been alight with people questioning whether these food products are of a lower standard or fail to meet EU regulations. In reality, products with the "Not for EU" logo simply mean they're meant to remain in the UK market, and it doesn't relate to products not being up to EU standards.  However, some shoppers are still a little uncertain.  "Let’s be honest about this, the ‘Not For EU’ label on foods shows that Britain is the dirty man of Europe thanks to #Brexit.  Your only upshot is a pint of wine!" joked one social media profile.  "They've spent decades complaining about the EU being over fussy on high food standards -now they label food in UK supermarkets as 'not for EU consumption'," added another.  Someone else wrote: "This all shows the wisdom of EU to insist on the ‘not for EU’ label. It safeguards EU producers against GB competitors that can produce cheaper because of lower environmental and labour standards." Another profile added: "Whatever the facts of the matter, this ‘Not for EU’ label will be widely read as Brexit dropping our food standards."                                             When do they come into effect?                                         The labelling was introduced to meat and some dairy products in Northern Ireland in August 2023. However, it will be rolled out across the rest of the UK later this year. The Government will expand the labelling to all milk and dairy products sold in Scotland, England, and Wales as of October 2024. Such products must also include the "Not for EU" messaging.  In 2025, the Government will then roll out the third phase, which will require the "Not for EU" logo for composite products, fruit, vegetables and fish moving to Northern Ireland, as well as products in England, Scotland, and Wales.
