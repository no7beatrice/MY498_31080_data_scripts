   I'm A Celebrity's Nigel Farage makes a Brexit joke and fails to do a basic maths sum as he finally gets screen time after his camp hit out at airtime MailOnline December 5, 2023 Tuesday 8:36 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: TV&SHOWBIZ; Version:1 Length: 502 words Byline: Kate Dennett For Mailonline Body                        Nigel Farage made a Brexit joke as he discussed the latest elimination from I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! during Wednesday night's episode. The former UKIP leader, 59, spoke about the second public vote before Nella Rose was eliminated from the jungle in Monday's episode. In the newly aired scenes, Nigel was seen making a Brexit joke as he discussed the elimination, quipping that he was a 'remainer'. He also failed to do a basic maths sum as he insisted that 50 per cent of the stars had already gone home - before being told that eight wasn't half of 12. Before Nella's elimination, Nigel said to Hollyoaks actor Nick Pickard: 'So when Ant and Dec come, our numbers will be down by 50%. We'll have gone from 12 to 8.' However, Nick correct him as he said: 'OK... isn't that six?' but a baffled Nigel simply asked: 'Sorry?' Clarifying, Nick, 48, added: 'Isn't six 50 per cent?', with Nigel adding: 'Sorry, I'm being silly.' Nella was the second star to leave in the public vote after the elimination of Frankie Dettori, but Jamie Lynn Spears and Grace Dent also left the programme early after they both quit - taking the original 12 contestants down to eight. In the Bush Telegraph, Nigel also made a Brexit related joke as he said: 'I've got no apprehension about this morning's eviction at all. For now, I'm a remainer.' Nigel finally secured some screen time in Wednesday's episode after his camp hit out at his minimal airtime on the hit ITV reality show. The politician has so far survived elimination at the expense of jockey Frankie and influencer Nella, but followers have questioned why he barely featured in a recent episode.  Nigel, who is understood to be earning a record £1.5million for his appearance in the jungle camp, has already expressed his dismay at not being nominated for Bushtucker Trials because they provide around 25 per cent of the show's airtime. Upon Nella's departure, Nigel's team took to his Instagram to share a mock-up of Farage as a wanted profile on BBC show Crimewatch.  An accompanying caption read: 'Apologies to all the ITV viewers who blinked between 9pm-10:20pm this evening.. You probably missed Nigel.' ITV producers had high hopes for Nigel after agreeing to a bumper fee with the GB News host, but sources claim they have been underwhelmed with his impact on the jungle camp.  An insider told The Mirror: 'People I know working on the show think Farage is one of the least interesting campmates ever.  'He is very boring and producers have struggled with fun storylines to show a different side to him. 'He's good for Brexit and culture wars stuff, but outside of that, the local wildlife is more entertaining than he is. 'One example is a few of them were talking about their favourite movies and he couldn't come up with a single one! Politics is his life and basically outside of that he's got no personality.'  Nigel's reported fee is understood to be a show record and eclipses the £320,000 earned by former Health Secretary Matt Hancock in 2022. Load-Date: December 5, 2023  End of Document
