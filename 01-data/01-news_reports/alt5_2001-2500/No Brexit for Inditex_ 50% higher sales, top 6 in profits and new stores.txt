   No Brexit for Inditex: 50% higher sales, top 6 in profits and new stores CE Noticias Financieras English October 30, 2023 Monday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

The textile giant's position after the Brexit, effective from January 1, 2021, has not only not suffered impacts, but has been strengthened with more sales, more profits and growth in its store network, despite the general withdrawal of the company in its most mature markets. The accounts of its British subsidiary reflect this evolution. Inditex had a turnover of 1,501 million pounds sterling in the last fiscal year, which ended on January 31 of this year, slightly more than 1,700 million euros at the current exchange rate, a record figure for the group in this market and a 37% jump over the previous year. Inditex then undertook a merger of the six commercial subsidiaries with which it operated its various brands, effective October 1, 2021. ITX UK Limited, the resulting entity, explains in its management report that part of the annual sales growth in 2022 is due to this consolidation of assets, but also to the good performance of sales in that country. If the results that the six now unified companies declared separately in their accounts for 2019, the last year unaffected by the pandemic before Brexit, are grouped together, the growth in revenues is 52%.

The net profit of the British subsidiary was 100.5 million pounds sterling, 115 million euros. Its profit before tax was 154 million, which makes the United Kingdom the sixth most profitable market for Inditex, the fourth if we exclude the Netherlands and Switzerland, whose profits are generated by the holding companies it has in those countries. It is only surpassed, in addition to Spain, by Mexico, with three times as many stores; and the US, the second most relevant market for the group after leaving Russia. In 2019, before Covid and Brexit, the UK was the tenth most profitable market. This has historically been a key country for Inditex, and not only quantitatively. The maturity and size of the market have made it conducive, for example, for the group to launch a year ago the Zara Pre Owned service, which allows users, among other things, their used clothes. Something that, for example, has not yet arrived in Spain, which is expected in the next four months. It was also one of the first countries in which the group began to deploy its strategy of replacing its smaller stores with megastores: from the Oxford Street store opened 11 years ago, to the opening in 2022 of a 4,500-square-meter Zara in Battersea, both in London. This year, moreover, it opened its first Oysho store in that country, and already operates all its brands there. In fact, its main European markets, the UK had the most net openings in 2022, with three, and is the only one of the 14 most important countries for Inditex that has not suffered net closures since 2020. The textile company has emerged unscathed from the Brexit, for which it prepared to minimize its risks. Since the referendum was held in June 2016, it began to implement measures to adapt its operations to the new framework that made the United Kingdom a third country. It did so in matters such as supply flows, transport, distribution, in addition to reviewing its administrative, accounting, tax and customs procedures. By the end of 2021, it was already claiming to be operating normally. Now, it is accelerating towards new records.
