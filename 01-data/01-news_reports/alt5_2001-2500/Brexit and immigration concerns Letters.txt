   Brexit and immigration concerns; Letters East Anglian Daily Times July 11, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 30 Length: 259 words Body   IT has been suggested that some people voted for Brexit because they were concerned about the level of immigration in the UK. Leaving the EU, they felt, would solve this issue. They did not arrive at this conclusion alone. People leading the Leave campaign told them Brexit would solve the immigration issue as they saw it, and many like Nigel Farage stood in front of billboard posters telling them exactly that. These same adverts appeared across many other parts of the media at the time to drive home that message. So how has that gone? Many of the EU migrants, strangely, felt very unwelcome and left the UK and the jobs they were doing for us, which left many sectors of our economy struggling. Agriculture, horticulture, health, care services and haulage have all suffered labour shortages. Despite this alleged 'benefit of Brexit', as it was sold, it was reported last month that legal immigration figures were now double the levels of those before Brexit. And yet, despite those figures doubling, many areas of our economy are still struggling with labour shortages. Once more, the number of those migrants who are crossing in small boats has also increased hugely since pre-Brexit times. Ironically, virtually without exception, they would love to work here and fill those vacancies. The long and short of it is that Brexit has failed in many areas and this is just another one of those failures. We really need to consider turning the Brexit clock back because it's clearly been an unmitigated disaster ,no matter how you measure it. JOHN DELL, Shotley.
