   ‘Punitive, odd, vexing’ – the French 90-day visa should never have existed telegraph.co.uk November 16, 2023 Thursday 1:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: TRAVEL; Version:1 Length: 1555 words Byline: By Hannah Meltzer , Destination Expert Highlight: British second home owners express cautious optimism after France signals a possible relaxation of post-Brexit rules Body   Ah, the smell of lavender, the sound of cicadas, the satisfying glug of rosé. What could be more delightful for a sun-starved Briton than a second home in La Belle France? But since Brexit, many people with a holiday home across La Manche find themselves grappling with strict visa rules and complex logistics, leaving some wondering if the sweet life is worth the headaches. This week the senate, France’s higher legislative chamber, voted through an amendment to “Le projet de loi immigration” immigration bill, which may give British people with homes in France reason for hope. The amendment, if accepted in the National Assembly lower house, would give Britons with a second home in France an automatic right to a long-stay visa, meaning they could come and go, friction-free, as was the case before Brexit (though it would not entail a right to work, for example). Under current rules, British visitors – property-owning or not – must stay no longer than 90 days in a 180-day period, in line with the general guidelines over the Schengen area.  This has differing effects on different people, depending on how they use or intend to use their French property. For John Owens, a retired business owner who lives in Salisbury, with a house near Calvados in northern France, the current rules don’t pose a problem. “We’ve never got close to that vexing 90-day limit,” he said.  For now, the same is true for Fiona Prest, a primary school headteacher who lives in Yorkshire with her husband Charles, a judge.  “I suppose for us at the moment, the 90/180 days rule doesn’t really affect us in the sense that we can only go during school holidays anyway,” she said.  However, the couple are concerned about what it will mean once they retire, when they would have hoped to spend larger chunks of the year in the property they bought outside of Uzès in the Occitane department in southern France. “The question for us is going to be when we retire, at which point – although I’ve done lots and lots of calculation – you can’t use the 90 in 180 days to be there when you want to be there. When you work it out, however you work it out, you’re ending up not being able to spend the time that you’d want to spend.” On first glance, the idea of being in your foreign property 90 days out of 180 might seem fair and doable enough, but the Schengen stay period is calculated on a “rolling” basis, which in practical terms makes the logistics of planning and carrying out travel complicated and fiddly, almost like a job in itself. One British woman, who asked not be named, described this difficulty, explaining that in the past she relied on the European Commission’s online Schengen Calculator  to work out when she could and couldn’t visit the home she’d owned in the south of France for two decades.  “Keeping to these 90 days in 180 days is quite difficult,” she says. “They don’t do it like half and half, you know how they do it – they go backwards. It’s odd really.” The Gov.co.uk website does an honourable job of trying to explain, simplifying it down to (only) five steps and two calculations. Bravo if you can make sense of it without getting a headache. Carol says she is not the only British second-home owner she knows doing the same complicated mathematics. “It’s just awful when you do go [to the south of France],” she said. “You get people saying: ‘Oh I’ve got to leave because I’ve just had all my days allowance for this tranche and I’ve got to get out!’.”  The French Government’s official line is that Britons with a home in France can choose to apply for a Short-stay visitor visa (VLS-T), which allows them to spend up to six months per year in the country, without the complicated 90-day calculations and without becoming a resident and all the tax implications that would imply.  However, administration in France is notoriously complicated, and with the knock-on backlog effects of Brexit and Covid, many Brits who have tried to apply for a visitor visa have found themselves confronted with long delays and additional costs, whether they apply at home via a company called TLScontact, or in France. Many Brits abroad are generally reluctant to get embroiled in the paperwork of visas, in particular when they were used to friction-free travel as pre-Brexit EU citizens. “Before everything was just very free and easy”, said Carol.  Peter Terrell and his wife Bridget, founders of a successful structural engineering firm, first moved to France in the late Seventies and brought up their now grown-up children in Paris. Though they are long-term residents, and so not directly affected by these limitations, they note that their bilingual children, who grew up in France before moving to the UK, now have trouble getting leave even to stay for longer periods. Describing the French visa process, Peter Terrell said: “They get you to jump through all sorts of hoops and they don’t tell you where the hoops are or what size they are or whether there are flames round them.” It is far from guaranteed that the bill in its current form and the amendment will be voted through, but home-owners are keeping their fingers crossed, as its impact would be life-changing: “It would mean that we could do what we thought we would always do, which is sort of six months [in each country], rather than thinking actually if we do it, we’re going to have to take a leap and do the whole lot ”, i.e. become permanent residents of France.  The amendment concerning Britons with second homes in France is just one small part of the wider immigration bill, a huge proposal that encompasses controversial subjects such as the rights and processing procedures for asylum seekers and the treatment of undocumented workers.  The law, put forward by President Macron’s centrist government, which does not have a parliamentary majority, will be hotly debated when it goes back to the lower house in December. So far the measures have been met with criticism from both left and right.  The amendment was tabled by Martine Berthet, who represents the Savoie area in the Alps, where there is a significant community of British second-home owners.  Berthet suggested not only that the current setup was causing heartache and headaches for those who had invested in France in good faith, but also that it makes economic sense to allow British citizens to contribute to small local economies in the often rural or coastal villages where they buy homes.  Peter Terrell knows many people with second homes in France. They know at least one Brit who spent a lot of time and money renovating a “stunning” property in Perpignan near the Spanish border. The friend said “it’s all too much” and is making plans to sell up. Speaking about the amendment, Terrel also emphasised the economic contribution of Brits who live part-time in France.  “I think it would be welcome from the French point of view because they realise how financially punitive it is – and the Brits have restored half the abandoned villages in France!” One thing all Britons in France seem to agree on, is that the general attitude towards Brexit is one of disappointment, even befuddlement, but certainly not personal animosity.  “We’re really welcome, [our neighbours] have been more than welcoming actually, we have a great time!,” said Fiona Prest. “I started a WhatsApp group with them and we organise a yearly meal for everyone with lots of wine, we’ve done it now for two years.” King Charles was well received on his recent visit to France and commentators were impressed by his speech-making in fluent French, notably in the French senate itself where his warmly toned speech was met with a standing ovation. Earlier this year, French people mourned their favourite “petite anglaise” Jane Birkin, while artistic Britons from David Hockney to Pete Doherty have made a home for themselves on these shores.  On a personal level, I have experienced plenty of affection for the British from the French (apart from that one time in a queue for a buffet in the Alps when someone mumbled something about “too many ros-bifs”, but we really can’t judge national opinions based on a buffet situation.)  Terrell, who has lived in France for over 40 years, has seen no change in attitudes since Brexit.  “In terms of the attitude to us since Brexit, it hasn’t changed at all, they just think that we must be collectively mad!”, he said. “I think they just find it a great shame, certainly, the French political establishment, but I think the French on the whole, there’s always been the rivalry and everything – but they do actually for some unknown reason admire us.”  All this in mind, a relaxing of rules for Francophile Brits might seem like a no-brainer, but there are plenty of fine points to work out – how does one define a second home, for instance? What if it sets a precedent for a kind of “golden visa” system and other “third countries” start demanding similar rights? This all remains to be thrashed out.  “I think I’m just very loath to think it will actually happen,”said Fiona Prest. “It just somehow seems too good to be true.” Well, if politics have taught us anything in recent years, it’s to expect the unexpected.                      Do you own a second home in France? How have you been impacted by post-Brexit visa rules?
