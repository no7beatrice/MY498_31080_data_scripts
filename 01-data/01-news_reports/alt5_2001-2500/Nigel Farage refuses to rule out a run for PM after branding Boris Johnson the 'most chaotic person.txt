   Nigel Farage refuses to rule out a run for PM after branding Boris Johnson the 'most chaotic person he's ever met' - and fans are all saying the same thing MailOnline November 22, 2023 Wednesday 9:39 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: TV&SHOWBIZ; Version:3 Length: 915 words Byline: Charlotte Dean For Mailonline Body   READ MORE: Meet the I'm A Celeb 2023 campmates: From Nigel Farage, Jamie Lynn Spears and Danielle Harold - in show's most outspoken line-up EVER                      Nigel Farage has said 'never say never' to running for Prime Minister in the future as he refused to rule out a bid for the top government job. The former UKIP leader, 59, was quizzed on whether he would ever consider the role during a conversation on Wednesday's episode of I'm A Celebrity. Nigel, who last night branded former PM Boris Johnson 'the most chaotic person he has ever met', said the strongest leaders were Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair.  His campamate Sam Thompson questioned him camp, asking: 'Who is your favourite Prime Minister ever in your lifetime?' Nigel said: 'Really, in my lifetime, two Prime Ministers who've been really strong, who've changed the country: one's Thatcher and one's Blair.  'I didn't like the way Blair changed the country at all but I have to admit he was a strong leader. Margaret was a very strong leader. They were tough times, but she changed the country completely.'                       Danielle Harold asked Nigel: 'Would you ever want to run?' Nigel replied: 'I don't know. We'll see. Depends how much of a mess the country gets in. I honestly don't know. It's not an easy job.' Following his comments, fans speculated that Nigel had entered the jungle in a bid to win the favour of a wider audience ahead of a political comeback. One person said: 'Idc this seems liek a way for Nigel to get a wider audience and people on his [side] then potentially run for prime minister.' Another noted: 'Nigel Farage doesn't rule out running to be Prime Minister after the next election. "I don't know, we'll see... never say never." Another quipped: 'I could smell those Prime Minister answers from a mile away Nigel.' Sharing a meme of Mr Bean winking, another said: 'Nigel Farage after saying "depends how bad the country gets" when asked about being prime minister.' While some guessed at Nigel's political ambitions, others admitted they wouldn't welcome the politician as the country's leader. One joked: 'Nigel threatening to be prime minister is scarier than all those challenges combined.' Another said: 'I don't want to exaggerate but if Nigel was prime minister I'd be on the first flight off the island.'                      Nigel came to blows with Fred Sirieix during a heated debate about Brexit during Monday's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! Nigel was the leader of the UK Independence Party from 2006 to 2009 and 2010 to 2016, and leader of the Brexit Party from 2019 to 2021, with a referendum on Brexit being held in 2016. His previous work in politics prompted questions from his fellow campmates while sat in the jungle camp during Monday's episode, with many of his fellow celebrities disagreeing with his views on the UK's exit from the European Union.  Around camp, This Morning host Josie Gibson asked Nigel what former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who worked on completing Brexit after the referendum, was like, saying: 'What's he like on a personal level?' Former EastEnders actress Danielle added: 'Forget politics, as a guy.' Nigel replied: 'Entertaining... in small doses. [He's] surprisingly introverted. You see this big act, fluffing the hair... surprising.' Josie asked: 'Is he quite a fumbler in real life, or is that just on the stage?' Nigel continued: 'I think he's one of the most disorganised human beings that possibly ever lived. The whole thing's bloody chaos. Shambles.' In the Bush Telegraph, Danielle said: 'I found it so interesting to listen, sat with him picking his brains, having a chat. Then it got a little bit heated.' Fred asked Nigel: 'What's the benefit of Brexit then? If you are an average person from Britain, what's the benefit?' Nigel said: 'To know that we're independent, we stand on our own two feet in the world.' Fred said: 'Brexit was about immigration, I remember your poster. I thought it was shameful what you did Nigel. Shameful.' Nigel replied: 'Sadly, sadly it was absolutely true. It was a poster showing mass young men moving illegally across borders.' Fred said: 'But it was about demonising migrants.' Nigel replied: 'No it wasn't. In your view it was, but it wasn't.' To which Fred said: 'It's not only just my view.' In the Bush Telegraph, Nigel said: 'I knew it wouldn't take long, I knew politics would rear its head as indeed it did. And Fred feels very strongly about it.' Having moved away to wash up, MasterChef star Grace Dent said to actor Nick Pickard: 'Brexit was his entire idea. It's his specialist subject. Fred's not going to change his mind on anything.' In the Bush Telegraph, Grace added: 'I would 100% rather wash up than listen to another single word about Brexit. I was just like, "Oh my god, I'm going to go and put my head in that stream".' Nigel also said: 'Brexit is about one thing and one thing only; being self-governing. We're in charge. We can get it right, we can make an absolute mess of it but we're in charge and the people who make those decisions we can hire and fire at elections where they have real power.' Fred said: 'I think the average person in the UK has lost out because of what you've done.' Nigel said: 'They haven't lost out.' In the Bush Telegraph, Fred added: 'Look, Nigel Farage is in the jungle with me. We're bound to have this conversation. At the end of the day nothing is going to change, Nigel believes what he believes, I believe what I believe. It was only a matter of time.' Load-Date: November 23, 2023  End of Document
