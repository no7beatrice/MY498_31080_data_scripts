   We must address the taboo of Brexit The Times (London) August 2, 2023 Wednesday Edition 1, Ireland  Copyright 2023 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 22 Length: 222 words Body   Sir, Edward Lucas ("We'll all suffer while Brexit remains taboo", comment, Jul 31) has clearly spelt out the present and (even more crippling) future costs of the UK decision made in 2016. He has also explained the problem of having pro and anti- Brexiteers in both the main political parties. Given this situation, surely there has never been a better opportunity for some charismatic billionaire to set up a new centre party with the main aim of rejoining the EU? The traditional ties that voters have to the major parties have never been weaker and the appeal of this new political party would only increase in the face of continuing UK economic weakness. David Lane Avon, Dorset Sir, Edward Lucas is surely right to point out that Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, has a policy of "near silence on the Brexit calamity". As a member of the party and someone who is seeking a constituency to fight at the next general election, I find it bonkers that while the Tories and Labour are in denial on the Brexit catastrophe, the Lib Dem leadership is keeping shtum on the issue. Sticking with Brexit is the politics of the living dead: it zombienomics. The public get this (look at the polling on Brexit). Byelections are one thing but at a general election it makes sense to punch our message home. John Sweeney London SE11 Load-Date: October 27, 2023  End of Document
