   Labour accused of wanting to drag Britain back into the EU after senior party figures propose 'closer relationship' with Brussels - including rejoining the customs union MailOnline January 22, 2024 Monday 1:02 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for a youth mobility agreement with the EU or a relaxation of post-Brexit visa rules that restrict travel and the ability to work in other European countries. Separately, Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn suggested that it would 'make sense' to link up more closely with the bloc, which he predicted will breathe a 'sigh of relief' if Labour wins the next election. But the comments reignited criticism over whether Sir Keir Starmer - an ardent Remainer who has since insisted a Labour government would respect the referendum result - had control over pro-EU elements in the party.                      Conservative Party chairman Richard Holden said: 'It's hardly surprising Sadiq Khan wants to drag us back into the EU, given Sir Keir Starmer spent years trying to block Brexit then overturn the largest democratic vote in British history.  'And now he's plotting to rip up our new relationship with the EU and even drag us back into the EU by 'stealth' with plans to hand millions of EU nationals the vote. 'Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will continue to build on our freedoms and stick to the plan which is working and has seen us have higher economic growth than either France or Germany.  'It couldn't be more clear that Labour would take us back to square one.' Mr Khan, who is facing a mayoral election this year, told a Fabian Society conference on Saturday: 'I'm not saying today we should rejoin the EU.  'What I'm saying is [Shadow Foreign Secretary] David Lammy is on to something when he's saying we should have a closer relationship with the EU.' Asked if that meant the customs union, he replied: 'I think everything should be on the table.' In an interview with the Observer, the mayor said a youth mobility scheme would 'benefit us economically, culturally and socially'. Leading Brexiteer and Tory MP Marco Longhi said last night: 'Sadiq Khan and Hilary Benn confirm the Labour Party's true stance on the EU. 'They never wanted to leave and they want to rejoin - whatever spin Keir Starmer wants voters to think.'  Former Cabinet minister David Jones said: 'Labour are desperately anxious to undo Brexit, and Khan and Benn's remarks simply underline that.' Reform UK leader Richard Tice told the Mail: 'Labour clearly have no faith in the country, and want to hand over control back to the unelected bureaucrats of Brussels.  'Voting for Labour will be voting for people who want to give away our hard-fought freedoms.' A Labour spokesperson said: 'Labour is focussed on facing the future, and making Brexit work - we absolutely will not rejoin the EU, the single market or the customs union. 'Making Brexit work means improving on the botched deal with a stronger collaborative relationship with our neighbours.' Load-Date: January 22, 2024  End of Document
