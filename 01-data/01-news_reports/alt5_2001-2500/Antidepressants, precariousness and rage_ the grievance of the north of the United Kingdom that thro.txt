   Antidepressants, precariousness and rage: the grievance of the north of the United Kingdom that throbs in Blackpool CE Noticias Financieras English February 6, 2024 Tuesday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC.

Three of her friends committed suicide when she was younger and a fourth hung himself not so long ago. Like her, others have had to learn to live with premature death in Blackpool, the beach town with a suicide rate well above the national average. Once a haven for British holidaymakers, it is also the place with the lowest life expectancy in the UK, where a young person will live sixteen years less than one in an affluent southeast region and where one in five suffers from depression. Years ago, Blackpool was something else. It was an Eden of floats, machine ice cream and fine sand. It was. Today it is a place in evident decline, turned into a symbol of those northern cities that fail to take off. (...) Johnson is a kind girl with black hair and light skin, who talks while drinking Red Bull (...). The day I met her, we chatted in the little shop she had just opened in Claremont Ward, a tough neighborhood in Blackpool. (...) She was kicked out of Claremont Ward when she was seventeen, after her friend and flatmate stabbed a guy from a rival gang. Years later she decided to come back. (...) "Here, whoever can, goes. Some of my classmates at school went to London or Manchester. Of those who stayed, many fell into alcohol, depression.... In London they don't care what happens here." (...) Blackpool is like other English seaside towns, a place with a double life. On the one hand it is a beach destination with all its complements deployed along the promenade. It has its Ferris wheel and pier full of rides and slot machines (...) There's a wax museum with Ed Sheeran songs looping in the background and a stall selling chocolate bars with customized and supposedly transgressive wrappers with messages like "I'm anti-vaccine" or "Asshole". There are a handful of fish and chips, where families line up to buy greasy cones of battered fish and chips and vinegar. And on the beach, the sea. Gray, rough and guarded by the famous Blackpool Tower, reminiscent of the Eiffel Tower, which in its glory days was the tallest structure in the British Empire. One year it was even reopened by Diana of Wales herself. But behind that holiday façade lies the real life of the city, the everyday and the off-season. That of low-paid jobs and unhealthy housing. That of antidepressants and anger towards the London establishment that they feel ignores them and that they don't trust because they feel it has let them down too many times. That of ordinary men and women who thought they saw Brexit as a chance for a better life. In Blackpool, 67.5% of the population voted in favor of Brexit and against what they see as London bureaucrats, who they feel are at best ignoring them. In some parts of the north, such as this one, poverty is visible and there is a deep sense of grievance about the south. This is of course an extreme case, but it is representative because it brings together many of the problems present in other cities in the north of the country. These regional differences have become a machine for creating citizen disaffection, the amniotic fluid from which monsters such as Brexit or Boris Johnson have been nourished. Because what happened in that cathartic referendum explains to a large extent the territorial fractures that tear this country apart, where the gap between London and its surroundings and the north of the country is deep. Here the people cried out for change. There may be much more obvious fractures, such as in Northern Ireland or Scotland, but the north-south divide, and between London and the rest, is crucial to understanding the UK and the recent profound changes that have transformed this country forever. Blackpool today is not even a shadow of its former self, but the glorious past is still very much alive in the memory of older people. This place was for decades the dream destination of British families. I understood this the morning my eyes were opened by a group of elderly ladies who had gathered for a chat and breakfast of tea and sliced bread toast spread with salted margarine in a social center of the city. That morning I learned more from the golden girls of Blackpool than from many a brainy book on Brexit. They helped me understand the extent to which nostalgia for an idealized past was a decisive factor in the referendum, especially for those of their generation, who voted overwhelmingly in favor of divorce. I understood the importance of the weight of memory in projecting the future and how difficult it is for them to let go of such a palpable longing for identity. Pauline Gedall, about to turn ninety, was undoubtedly the most lucid. She preserved intact a mind-boggling capacity for analysis. Perhaps because she had dedicated her life to music (...) She remembers the golden years of Blackpool. "Summering here was a dream. It was a very wealthy town, where the hotels were always full. If someone had a spare room, they would announce it on the radio." This was where the factory workers from the northern cities spent their vacations." (...) The first time he came on vacation with his parents from neighboring Manchester he was three and a half years old. The boom years came to an end with the closure of the factories and the traumatic industrial reconversion of the north of the country. The workers no longer had vacations or money for summer holidays. Then came the boom of cheap flights that ended up giving the final blow to a city unable to compete with the prices and the sun of Spain or Turkey. (...) In 2014 the airport of the coastal city stopped operating because it was losing two million pounds a year. Stores closed and the small hotels ended up divided into room-homes that are now rented out to entire families. (...) The glorious past here and elsewhere in the UK proved a decisive factor in the referendum. Many wanted to go back and nostalgia crystallized at the ballot box. Gedall, like 52% of Britons, voted in favor of Brexit. "It was about pride in England, in our country. We wanted to have power over our decisions, we wanted to get our identity back, which had been diluted. We thought we could turn back the clock of time, but you can't." Now, Gedall realizes that that nostalgic reverie has done them no good. Especially for young people and those who, like Blackpool, find themselves at the weakest end of the chain of political and macroeconomic decisions. When cutbacks bite, inflation soars and wages fall short, it is in places like this that the whiplash is felt particularly acutely. (...) Doctors even refer to the conditions of many of those living here as "shit life syndrome". That is, people with anxiety, depression and other mental illnesses, caused or aggravated by the hostile environment in which they live. The data are not very encouraging throughout the country, but the situation is much more acute in the north. Ana Carbajosa (Barcelona, 1974) is a journalist.
