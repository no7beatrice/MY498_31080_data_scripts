   Song of lament for Brexit; Letters Eastern Daily Press July 18, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 36,37 Length: 226 words Body   THE former environment minister George Eustice, who served under Boris Johnson, has just effectively stated that Brexit was a mistake and called on the government to negotiate with the EU, to reopen the UK's borders to thousands of young workers from EU nations to tackle post- Brexit labour shortages. He also criticises government immigration policies since the UK left the EU and has called for a reciprocal two-year visa arrangement between the EU and the UK.So many former Brexiteers are now realising that either Brexit was a mistake and/ or that government olicies are not up to the taking back of control so pushed for in the past few years. Many Remainers argued during the referendum campaign that the best deal was to remain in the EU. Arguably, this is proving correct. Some in government now want a further referendum on whether the UK should leave the European Convention of Human rights and thus not be bound by the European Court of Human Rights so advocated by Winston Churchill and others in the post war period. I am reminded of the song in the 1960s, Juliet by the Four Pennies. To rephrase the words but to keep to the tune: "Brexit Brexit, You broke my heart, left me unsure Brexit Brexit..." This record was their only number one. Let us hope another referendum will not lead to leaving the ECHR. TIM BORNETT, Hargham Close, Old Buckenham. Load-Date: October 26, 2023  End of Document
