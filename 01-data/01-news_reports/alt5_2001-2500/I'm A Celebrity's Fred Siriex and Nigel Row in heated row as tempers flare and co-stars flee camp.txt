   I'm A Celebrity's Fred Siriex and Nigel Row in heated row as tempers flare and co-stars flee camp chroniclelive.co.uk November 20, 2023 Monday 9:52 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: TV; Version:1 Length: 419 words Byline: By, Simon Duke Highlight: First Dates star Fred Siriex locked horns with politician Nigel Farage in heated scenes on Monday's I'm A Celebrity Body   Fred Siriex and Nigel Farage have been embroiled in a heated row on I'm A Celebrity, with some of their co-stars fleeing the camp as tempers flared. While controversial political figure Nigel has sparked a backlash against ITV over his involvement in the show, First Dates star Fred is one of the early favourites to win and he probably hasn't done his chances no harm, after taking on Nigel in a row about Brexit on Monday night's show. In stark contrast with the compassionate chat he'd just had with Jamie-Lynn Spears, as she broke her silence on Britney, Fred quickly became frustrated as he and Nigel clashed on the matter that Nigel's party pushed for. Quick to get Nigel's take on just what good Brexit has done, Fred asked: "What's the benefit of Brexit then If you are an average person from Britain, what's the benefit to which Nigel replied: "To know that we're independent, we stand on our own two feet in the world."

Not backing down on his point, Fred became more animated, commenting: ""Brexit was about immigration, I remember your poster. I thought it was shameful what you did Nigel. Shameful." Just like Fred, Nigel too stood strong on his opinion, telling his co-star :Sadly, sadly it was absolutely true. It was a poster showing mass young men moving illegally across borders."  As Fred accused the UKIP campaign for Brexit of "demonising migrants," Nigel fired back: "No it wasn't. In your view it was, but it wasn't," at which point, several of the pair's I'm A Celebrity co-stars, including Hollyoaks actor Nick Pickard rand Grace Dent retreated away from them, with Grace saying in the Bush Telegraph: "I would 100% rather wash up than listen to another single word about Brexit. I was just like, 'Oh my god, I'm going to go and put my head in that stream.'"  While Nick and Grace weren't there to see it, the row between Fred and Nigel continued back in camp, with Nigel adding: "Brexit is about one thing and one thing only; being self-governing. We're in charge. We can get it right, we can make an absolute mess of it but we're in charge and the people who make those decisions we can hire and fire at elections where they have real power." And then, as Fred claimed that the average person in the UK 'lost out' because of Nigel's actions, the politician, still very much steadfast in his own views, told him:" They haven't lost out."
