   Keir Starmer allies battle to block 'unhelpful' debate on unwinding Brexit at Labour conference MailOnline October 6, 2023 Friday 12:57 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

A motion proposed by the Labour Movement for Europe calls for the party to negotiate closer ties with the EU including a new visas deal. The text - said to be backed by shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves' constituency group among others - stresses that campaigning to rejoin the bloc immediately would not be in the country's 'best interests'. But it says the government's 'hard Brexit' agreements should be watered down to 'salvage' as much 'trade and opportunity' as possible.  The motion seems to have spooked the leadership, with the topics for debate in Liverpool due to be decided by a ballot on Sunday. Sir Keir has been adamant that the UK will not go back into the single market or customs unions, but desperately tried avoid being pinned down. According to the Guardian, centrist grouping Labour to Win has messaged supporters urging them to back six specific topics for discussion. That would mean delegates talk about issues such as the NHS and Ukraine - but not 'unhelpful' areas such as Brexit. 'It is essential that we all vote for these to ensure that supporters of the leadership have control of the conference agenda,' the message said. Former frontbencher Stella Creasy, chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, told the Guardian: 'There is clearly an interest amongst members in moving beyond the old debate about whether you can make Brexit work and whether we can rejoin. 'Keir has set out that we want a closer relationship with Europe so it's understandable members want to discuss openly what Britain can negotiate in the first years of a Labour government Load-Date: October 6, 2023  End of Document
