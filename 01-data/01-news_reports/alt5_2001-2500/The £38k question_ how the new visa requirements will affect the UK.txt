   The £38k question: how the new visa requirements will affect the UK thetimes.co.uk December 10, 2023 Sunday 12:10 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 1925 words Byline: Tom Calver, Data Editor Highlight: Boston in Lincolnshire is Britain’s migration capital — and offers lessons for James Cleverly ahead of his skilled worker visa shake-up Body   In the mountain valleys of Kyrgyzstan, winter temperatures regularly fall twenty degrees below zero yet even the extremities of his home country failed to prepare Ilimbek Avilia for the wet Wildmore Fens.  “Rain, rain, every day,” chuckles the 42-year-old, who is enjoying a day off from his job at a farm, packing fruit and vegetables. This morning he and his wife Ainura left their temporary home — a caravan on a farm near the village of Wrangle, Lincolnshire — and walked a mile up a narrow dirt track to the closest bus stop to go shopping. Boston is a “beautiful town” he says but “Money, money, money” brought them to Britain: in Kyrgyzstan workers make less than £300 a month, but he makes that in less than a week. His seasonal worker visa, which gives him permission to work in Britain for six months for a specific agricultural employer, will expire in March but Avilia vows to return.  For two decades, Boston has been Britain’s migration capital. The market town and inland port received more EU nationals than any other local authority in the lead up to the Brexit referendum — and, since then, it has had a huge influx of workers from central Asia. While Britain’s post-Brexit system was meant to take back control of borders, last year net legal migration reached a record high of 745,000.  Many Europeans have left; driving this increase is a net arrival of 873,000 non-EU nationals. These include 260,000 visas for humanitarian and asylum routes, such as one-off schemes for Hong Kong and Ukrainian nationals. Net migration of non-EU students has surged to 243,000, plus another 82,000 dependants. Finally, the number of additional non-EU workers reached 123,000, with 102,000 dependants on top; most of these arrivals work in health and social care.  In response, James Cleverly, the home secretary, has announced the minimum salary for skilled worker visas will rise from £26,200 to £38,700. The number of dependants people are bringing with them — which has increased sharply since 2021, as migrants come from further afield and look to permanently resettle with their families — is also in ministers’ sights. From the spring, if you want to bring a foreign family member to Britain, you must  earn at least £38,700 ; foreign care workers, meanwhile, cannot bring any dependants at all. All in all, these measures are expected to cut 300,000 migrants a year nationally. But what will they do to Boston?                     Migration capital                    Once, it was almost a rite of passage for local people to work on the lands around Boston when they left school. “I’ve done it, I worked on the land — I’ve done packing, grading, raking up — and I know how bloody hard it is,” says Debs, at the bar of a Brewers Fayre pub on the outskirts of town. Now in her fifties, she has spent 22 years working at the city’s Pilgrim hospital — but when she first arrived in Boston in her twenties, the land provided a reliable source of decent income.  Yet as farms expanded, demand for workers grew — and to business owners, the offer of newly available migrant labour became appealing.  Twenty years ago, thousands of workers from Portugal were lured by newspaper adverts to work in the fields around Boston. Then, after the enlargement of the European Union in 2004, came the Poles, followed in the mid-2010s by Romanian and Bulgarian workers.  Then, when Britain’s post-Brexit immigration system, plus the pandemic, resulted in some of these workers either moving back home or to better jobs here, in came the Kyrgyz, Uzbeks and Kazakhs; in just three years the number of migrants from central Asia rose from seven to 1,165, according to an analysis of new national insurance numbers. Between 2001 and 2021, the town’s population rose from 56,000 to 71,000 — an increase of 27 per cent. Today, a quarter of its current inhabitants were born overseas. On West Street — nicknamed “East Street” because of the European flags plastered in shop windows — Cristina Warrant runs a “citizens advice for immigrants”, helping new arrivals cope with life in Britain. Romanian-born Warrant, who has lived in Britain since 2002, thinks Britain’s current post-Brexit immigration system has become “unbelievably strict”. This may seem an odd claim about a series of policies that, nationally, resulted in record levels of immigration but Brexit, the data shows, has had a curious effect on Boston.  In 2022, for the first time in decades, more people left Boston than arrived according to the Office for National Statistics; the town’s population actually fell. The end of free movement — and toughening up of the visa system — has stemmed the arrival of European migrants. Moreover, the appeal of British wages is no longer as great as it was in countries like Poland where wages are catching up. Many people have left. “It’s had a big impact on the local economy,” adds Warrant, motioning to the empty shops up and down the high street. As a result, Boston has been at the forefront of a scramble for migrant workers to replace those who left. Since 2016, job vacancies in Boston have risen much higher than the national average, according to the job site Indeed. Some of those new workers, like Avilia, have come from beyond Europe. Since Brexit, there has been a fundamental shift in how  visas  are allocated, points out Dora-Olivia Vicol, chief executive of the Work Rights Centre. Now, they are tied to employers, not individuals. There is no clear route for a seasonal farm worker, for example, to do any other job, without applying for a new visa. This makes migrant work much less secure, adds Vicol, but it also hinders career progression. Unemployment among new arrivals is extremely low, simply because if you lose your job, you’re out.  Ivo Ivanov knows Britain’s minimum wage better than most government ministers. “£11.44 from April,” says the 38-year-old, who employs half a dozen staff at his Bulgarian grocery shop on Emery Lane, and his bakery over the road. He quadrupled his salary by moving to Boston eight years ago. “I spent four years on the fields; cabbage, salad, potatoes.” It was “tough work”, he concedes, but he was soon able to save up enough to start his own business.  Such a path is no longer available for seasonal workers like Avilia; the post-Brexit immigration system in place since 2021 picks and chooses people to fill specific jobs.                     New rules                    Although the minimum salary required for skilled workers is increasing sharply under Cleverly’s plan, data suggests that will only affect a small proportion of workers. Firstly, around 70 per cent of the 208,000 skilled worker visas issued in the year to September 2023 for the UK either went to care workers or health workers, who are exempt.  Secondly, most of the remaining 60,000 skilled workers actually earn quite a bit more than £38,700 anyway. The biggest category of skilled visa workers, for example, has been software developers, who earn an average of £60,000. The exceptions, at the lower end, include hospitality workers and butchers who, while classed as “skilled” — are paid an average of just £26,000 a year.  This could spell bad news for places like Boston, which have more butchers and chefs than software developers. Although there is no local breakdown of visa demands, an analysis of job postings from Indeed shows that food preparation job vacancies are up 121 per cent on 2016.  For nearly a century, Bycroft’s has served the carnivorous needs of the people of Boston — winning awards for its Lincolnshire sausages — but its owner, Jeff Greenfield, believes being a butcher has never been harder. “They’re so tough to recruit: I don’t think anyone wants manual work anymore,” he says. “A lot of butchers are factory butchers — but shop butchers, where you do everything, are much less common.” Greenfield has so far avoided having to recruit overseas, a fact he puts down to “luck” due to the paperwork it would involve. “We’re a market town and have strong loyal customers here — country folk like their meats,” he adds. The wages, he says, are “all right” — but not near the £38,700 he would have to pay to recruit someone from abroad.  Yet notably absent from last week’s reforms — and crucial to Boston’s economy — were changes to the government’s seasonal worker programme. These workers are exempt from the new salary thresholds; nationally, around 45,000 of these visas are set to be issued this year, with similar numbers expected next year — yet with fruit often left rotting in fields, many local farmers feel the scheme is not sufficient to meet their long-term needs. According to Indeed, advertised vacancies for farm workers in Boston have increased a staggering 7,000 per cent since 2016.  The clampdown on dependants, though, could spell problems for the region’s care homes. Care workers — many of whom are seeking permanent relocation with their families from countries including Nigeria and the Philippines — will be banned from bringing family members.  Neil Russell has about 30 carers who have been recruited across his three homes for adults with neurological conditions, one of which is based in Peterborough, less than 30 miles from Boston. “They’re from the far east, the near east, Africa — that cohort replaced a lot of Europeans who left,” he says. “Someone from Poland isn’t looking for care jobs in the UK anymore — they’re going to Germany or France, because they don’t need to go through that expensive visa process.” With 150,000 vacancies across the sector, he worries about future recruitment if there is a limit on dependants. “We’ve got to find ways of attracting British staff — but we’d have to pay £20 an hour, which we just can’t afford. “A lot of new arrivals bring school age children or partners, who then look for work, but I don’t know anyone who’s brought a partner that isn’t working,” he adds. “I’ve got four members of one family all working for me.” The new rules on dependants, he says, seem “unbalanced and unreal”.  A future option for Boston’s care homes and other vacancy-high industries might be to recruit from other parts of Britain. Data from the ONS shows that for the past two years, unusually, net internal migration to Boston from other parts of the UK has been net positive. Wages do appear to be improving in Boston, helped partly by minimum wage rules but also a reduction in available labour. In 2000, the typical full-time Boston worker earned 93 per cent of the national average. After years of EU migration, this fell to 72 per cent in 2017, but has since recovered to 81 per cent. Last week, before resigning as immigration minister, Robert Jenrick called for businesses to invest in domestic workforces to encourage British workers to fill gaps in the labour market. There are some signs that Brexit has made it easier for locals to find jobs: between 2011 and 2021, the local unemployment rate fell faster than the Lincolnshire average.  Yet from the Bulgarian superstores to the English pubs, there is a consensus that there are some jobs in Boston that British people simply won’t do. On the fields around Boston, there is no alternative but to import workers such as Avilia. “I don’t even think it’s a money thing,” suggests Kathryn, a bartender at the Brewers Fayre pub, who moved to Britain from Zimbabwe when she was a teenager. “It’s a generational thing. I’ve had to do work like that before, and I’d do it again,” she says. “But my younger sister, who spent more of her early years here, recently tried to hold down a manual job. She quit a week later!” Load-Date: December 10, 2023  End of Document
