   Brits will have to give fingerprints to holiday in Europe: Holidaymakers face travel chaos next autumn with introduction of post-Brexit checks and facial scans on entry into EU MailOnline December 19, 2023 Tuesday 8:51 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:5 Length: 945 words Byline: Rory Tingle, Home Affairs Correspondent Body   Visitors to Europe face huge queues at borders from next Autumn due to new strict post-Brexit border controls. British and non-EU passport holders will have to go through fingerprint checks and face scans under the new EU Entry/Exit System (EES). It will replace the stamping of passports, which began after Brexit when the UK became a 'third country' to the bloc - meaning it is not a member state and does not have the right to free movement within the EU. The system will check each passenger's name and biometric data when they enter an EU country. It was due to be rolled out earlier this year but has been delayed several times. Some nations have expressed concerns about how much time the process will add to queues at EU borders, with the Slovenian government saying it will take 'up to four times longer'. Despite apprehensions EES will be introduced on October 6, according to the Independent.                      READ MORE - Don't panic!

Personal data including first name, surname, date of birth, nationality, sex, travel document and the three-letter country code will all be required - with under 12s exempt. Austria claims processing times would be 'double compared to the current situation', while Croatia warned checks would 'certainly be significantly longer'. French officials will carry out EES border checks at the Port of Dover, Folkestone for the Eurotunnel and at St Pancras International for the Eurostar. In a report released earlier this year, French public finance watchdog Cour des Comptes predicted queues at the UK-France border will at least double when the EES is launched in 2024. The Port of Dover, which has regularly seen long delays resulting from post-Brexit checks, said the new system could lengthen inspections on cars from 45 seconds to as long as ten minutes. Port chief Doug Bannister said: 'Even at the busiest times right now, with new post-Brexit rules, passport checks are taking 45 to 90 seconds per car. 'With the pre-registration involved, a car with a family of four or five in it could take up to ten minutes.

Eurotunnel warned it could take as much as six minutes longer to process each car boarding its trains. EES will cover arrivals to all EU countries except Cyprus and Ireland. It is also being adopted by Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. One of the reasons for delaying its introduction was next year's Olympic Games in Paris, with chiefs warning it could cause chaos for millions of passengers travelling to France. Around six months after EES is introduced, the EU will bring in Etias - a visa waiver system similar to the US Esta. This will cost (EURO)7 (£6) per person and will be required for people entering the Schengen Area. The EU has rejected concerns ESS will cause chaos at borders and claimed it will actually save time. A spokesman said: 'The main advantage of the EES is saving time. 'The EES replaces passport stamping and automates border control procedures, making travelling to European countries using the EES more efficient for the traveller.' It comes as holidaymakers face an anxious wait to see if the eruption of a volcano in Iceland will interrupt their flights to the country. The eruption on the Reykjanes peninsula just north of the evacuated town of Grindavik began last night at around 10.17 pm after an earthquake swarm, the Icelandic Meteorological Office said, referring to a series of small shakes. There are fears that the eruption, which has seen 200 cubic metres of lava spewing out from the fissures every second, could cause havoc to air traffic after the Icelandic eruption in 2010 grounded thousands of flights across Europe and North America and saw holidaymakers stranded. Flights from Reykjavik's international Keflavik airport were delayed last night, with an EasyJet flight to Manchester standing on the tarmac for five hours before taking off at 1.35am due to the volcanic activity. Passengers were told by easyJet: 'We're sorry that your flight has been delayed. This is because volcanic activity in Keflavik (KEF) is causing restrictions to the areas in which aircraft are permitted to fly.' British holidaymakers are waiting anxiously to see if their flights will be cancelled today - but the Icelandic government and airlines including EasyJet have said the airports in Iceland are 'not impacted' and flights should be operating 'as scheduled'. Indeed, Hallgrímur Indriðason, a journalist from Icelandic state broadcaster RUV, said there was 'no threat to air traffic - at least not for now' with Reykjavik's international Keflavik airport remaining open today.  Previous eruptions near the Fagradalsfjall volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula took place in 2021, 2022 and earlier this year. In 2010, the eruption of Iceland's long-dormant Eyjafjallajokull volcano - an ice-capped volcano more than 1,660 metres tall - shot huge amounts of ash into the atmosphere. That massive, explosive eruption was not fatal, but forced the cancellation of around 100,000 flights and left more than 10 million travellers stranded. Load-Date: December 19, 2023  End of Document
