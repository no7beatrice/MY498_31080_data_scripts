The increase continued until June 2023, with a net migration of 672,000 people, according to recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which reported that during that period there were 1.2 million immigrant inflows, in contrast to emigration of 508,000 people.  The majority of these immigrants, some 968,000, came from non-European Union (EU) countries, followed by EU and British citizens, with 129,000 and 84,000 respectively, the official agency indicated.  Analysts say these demographic changes reflect a transformation in migration patterns since the coronavirus pandemic.  Asylum and visa programs for citizens from the Chinese territory and former British colony of Hong Kong and for refugees from Ukraine, as well as an increase in the arrival of non-EU students and workers drove this increase.  In June 2023, labor migrants accounted for 33% of total non-EU immigration, a significant increase compared to June 2022. Indian, Nigerian and Zimbabwean nationals led the way in obtaining work visas, especially in the health and care sectors.   Work-related immigration also saw a rise, reaching 45,000. Study-related immigration also showed an increase, with 378,000 arrivals in June 2023, mainly attributed to an increase in student dependents, especially from Nigeria and India.  The new graduate visa route was a key factor in this growth, increasing to 115,000.  For humanitarian routes, immigration fell to 83,000, a significant reduction from the 157,000 recorded in June 2022, with Ukrainians and Hong Kong nationals being the most prominent. Family-based immigration and emigration remained stable, with a slight increase in net migration.  The British Home Office reported that 90% of the 40,386 people who arrived in precarious boats across the English Channel up to June 2023 applied for asylum or registered as dependents in an asylum claim.  A complex realityThesefigures show a complex reality in the UK migration landscape, marked by a significant increase in net migration and changes in immigration and emigration trends.  According to the British radio station Sky News, the Conservative MP and former minister Simon Clarke expressed his concern about the current situation, arguing that "it is unsustainable both economically and socially" to maintain such high levels of legal migration.  In the same vein, Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, launched a blunt criticism of the current government, pointing out that the statistics reveal "the extent of the Conservatives' total failure on immigration, asylum and the economy".  In response to the criticism, Home Secretary James Cleverly, for his part, emphasized the government's commitment to managing the situation and assured that the government remains "fully committed to reducing levels of legal immigration" while focusing on "tackling relentlessly" illegal migration.  One of the key reasons why the UK chose to leave the EU was control over immigration.  Post-Brexit fearsDuringthe run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum, there was growing concern among a significant portion of the British population and some politicians about immigration levels, especially from other EU countries.  As a member of the EU, the UK was subject to the Union's free movement policies, which allowed citizens of EU member states to live and work in any other member state, including the UK, without the need for visas or work permits.  This aspect of EU membership was seen by many in the UK as a relinquishment of control over its own borders and immigration policies.   Proponents of Brexit argued that leaving the EU would allow the UK to regain full control over its borders and set its own immigration policy, potentially limiting the number of people who could enter the country and work there.
