Holyhead registered an increase in freight tonnage of 9.1% between 2021 and 2022 but it was still down 23% on 2019. Ferry giant Stena said some of this lost business was starting to come back to Holyhead and they hope that the Anglesey Freeport status will help them further recover. Ian Davies, Head of UK Port Authorities at Stena Line said: "Holyhead Port witnessed a surge in freight volumes in the final few months leading up to Brexit. Once implemented, Brexit created a sharp decline of nearly 70% for the first few weeks. "However, volumes have gradually recovered over time to the current levels, which are 23% behind this pre-Brexit high. "In the last few months, we have started to see an increase in displaced freight volumes due to changes in the market between Liverpool and Dublin, with hauliers looking for alternative routes across the Irish Sea. "As one of the partners in the Anglesey Freeport and as part of the Freeport proposition, Stena Line has the long-term ambition to develop a Digital Trade Corridor with the aim of restoring natural trade flows and hence attracting more freight to return to the route."
