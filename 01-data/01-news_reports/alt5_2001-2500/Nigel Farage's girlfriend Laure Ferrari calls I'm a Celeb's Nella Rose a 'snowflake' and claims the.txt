   Nigel Farage's girlfriend Laure Ferrari calls I'm a Celeb's Nella Rose a 'snowflake' and claims the politician isn't threatened by Fred Sirieix's beliefs after their Brexit squabble MailOnline December 1, 2023 Friday 11:33 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: TV&SHOWBIZ; Version:1 Length: 466 words Byline: Kirsten Murray For Mailonline Body                        Nigel Farage's girlfriend Laure Ferrari has labelled Nella Rose a 'snowflake' after watching latest episodes of I'm A Celebrity.  The 44-year-old has stayed out of the spotlight for many years, yet now her lover is deep in the celebrity jungle she has publicly admitting to being his girlfriend, and isn't holding back with her thoughts on the series.  The ex-UKIP leader, 59, and YouTuber, 26, have very opposing political opinions and have previously fallen out in camp over issues such as immigration and Brexit. Laure told The Sun that Nella: 'epitomises that snowflake generation where they are told that they should be offended by every little thing.' She also aired her grievances towards Fred Sirieix, 51, who Nigel has also clashed with.  The two men have also clashed after Fred accused Nigel of 'destroying the economy' and 'creating a big mess' by encouraging the Brexit vote.  The Frenchman previously asked the former UKIP leader to name the positives of the Brexit vote, which Nigel promptly declared were 'liberation', 'taking back control' and 'self-government'. However, Fred interrupted to say: 'Don't make me laugh!' Speaking in the Bush Telegraph, Nigel said 'Fred can't help himself occasionally' and admitted the two of them were never going to agree. Discussing the disagreement Laure explained that Fred's anti-Brexit views angered her, especially as she is also French.  She said: 'I was like, well, isn't it a bit rude to come from a different country and lecture the British electorate about the way the British people voted in 2016?' She explained that compared to the enemies, attacks and death threats Nigel has already faced throughout his political career, Fred is the least of his problems and their heated discussions won't faze him. Nigel has created a bit of a name for himself in camp after recently stripping completely naked on a number of occasions, leaving his fellow campmates stunned. And Laure admitted that she had in fact watched these scenes with none other than Nigel's mother.  She said: 'We giggled because honestly at the end of the day it's just, a behind, it's just a bottom and it's clean.' Laure finally spoke out about her and Nigel's relationship with MailOnline as she revealed she believes the politician can win it.  'I really believe Nigel can win. He will be a good campmate. He is extremely tolerant of people's little ways, and that will gain him support from the public.' If 'tolerant' doesn't necessarily sound like the Farage we all know (and some love to hate), petite Laure is standing by the man 15 years her senior - even if that means watching as his bare bottom is shown to millions of viewers in the open-sided jungle shower. 'Nigel has a great bottom, what's wrong with that?' asked Laure, 'If you've got it, flaunt it!' Load-Date: December 2, 2023  End of Document
