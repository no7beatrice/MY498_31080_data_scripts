   I'm A Celebrity winner already named after 'best scene' as stars clash over Brexit examiner.co.uk November 21, 2023 Tuesday 8:54 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: CELEBS & TV; Version:1 Length: 605 words Byline: By, Mark Jefferies & Monde Mwitumwa Highlight: I'm A Celebrity camp mates Fred and Nigel clashed Body   The I'm A Celebrity jungle heated up last night as Fred Sirieix attacked Nigel Farage over Brexit and branded his campaign as "shameful". The First Date star wasted no time questioning Nigel on his tactics and motivation for wanting the UK to leave Europe in 2016. Fred said the average person had "lost out" now we were no longer part of the EU, but Farage insisted "they haven't lost out" despite a catalogue of problems for the country since it officially left on January 31, 2020. The conversation started calmly with Josie Gibson and Danielle Harold asking Farage what ex Prime Minister Boris Johnson was really like The Mirror reports. Nigel revealed: "Entertaining... in small doses. [He's] surprisingly introverted. You see this big act, fluffing the hair... surprising." Then went on to say: "I think he's one of the most disorganised human beings that possibly ever lived. The whole thing's bloody chaos. Shambles." In the Bush Telegraph Danielle said: "I found it so interesting to listen, sat with him picking his brains, having a chat. Then it got a little bit heated." Fred asked Farage: "What's the benefit of Brexit then If you are an average person from Britain, what's the benefit" Farage said: "To know that we're independent, we stand on our own two feet in the world." Fred said back: "Brexit was about immigration, I remember your poster. I thought it was shameful what you did Nigel. Shameful." Farage replied: "Sadly, sadly it was absolutely true. It was a poster showing mass young men moving illegally across borders." Fred then said: "But it was about demonising migrants." Farage replied: "No it wasn't. In your view it was, but it wasn't." To which Fred said: "It's not only just my view."

In the Bush Telegraph Farage said: "I knew it wouldn't take long, I knew politics would rear its head as indeed it did. And Fred feels very strongly about it." During the conversation, Farage also said: "Brexit is about one thing and one thing only; being self-governing. "We're in charge. We can get it right, we can make an absolute mess of it but we're in charge and the people who make those decisions we can hire and fire at elections where they have real power." Fred said: "I think the average person in the UK has lost out because of what you've done." Farage said: "They haven't lost out." In the Bush Telegraph Fred said afterwards: "Look, Nigel Farage is in the jungle with me. We're bound to have this conversation. At the end of the day nothing is going to change, Nigel believes what he believes, I believe what I believe. It was only a matter of time." But fans were more than loving it -claiming it was the 'best scene in reality TV's history'. Social media was flooded with praise for "clear winner" Fred. One X user called Phil posted: "Fred attacking Nigel about politics, is one of the best moments I've seen on reality tv this year. He spoke for the people. Fred to win." Super TV said: "Ugh I'm just imagining if this were Big Brother. We'd have "GET NIGEL OUT" and "FRED FOR THE WIN" chants by Friday." Char added: "We're on day two & we've already had Nigel Farage's bare a, Jamie Lynn Spears trying to win a redemption arc, & Fred Sirieix destroying Nigel over Brexit."
