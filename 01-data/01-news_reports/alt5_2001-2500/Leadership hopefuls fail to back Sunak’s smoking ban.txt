   Leadership hopefuls fail to back Sunak’s smoking ban telegraph.co.uk April 16, 2024 Tuesday 8:09 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:6 Length: 10865 words Byline: By Daniel Martin, Deputy Political Editor and Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor and Genevieve Holl-Allen, Political Reporter and Joe Barnes, BRUSSELS CORRESPONDENT and Amy Gibbons, Political Correspondent Body   Nearly half of Tory MPs, including five leadership hopefuls, failed to support Rishi Sunak’s flagship smoking ban  on Tuesday. A total of 165 Conservatives either abstained or voted against the legislation, with critics warning against “health police’’  wanting to limit people’s freedom. The Prime Minister got his plans through with the support of Labour MPs. Across the House, 383 voted for the ban and 67 did not, meaning the Bill went through comfortably.  While 180 Tories supported the legislation, 59 voted against and 106 did not vote. Kemi Badenoch, widely seen as a future candidate for the Tory leadership , was among those to vote against the Tobacco and Vapes Bill. Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick, other leadership hopefuls , also voted against the Bill at its second reading, while Penny Mordaunt and Priti Patel abstained. Along with Mrs Badenoch, five other ministers voted against the scheme, which Mr Sunak sees as a major part of his legacy. The Business Secretary did not speak in the debate, but wrote on Twitter that she could not support legislation where “people born a day apart will have permanently different rights”. The Bill – announced with much fanfare by the Prime Minister at last year’s Tory conference – will make it illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone who turned 15 this year or younger, with the aim of creating a “smoke-free” generation.  MPs were given a free vote on the Bill, so the 59 Tories who voted against it were not officially classed as acting in rebellion.  However, the scale of the revolt will be seen by many as an indicator of dissatisfaction with Mr Sunak’s plans and the potential direction of the party under a future leader. Mrs Badenoch tweeted: “I’m not a smoker and think it is an unpleasant habit , costly for both the individual and society. “The PM’s intentions with this Bill are honest and mark him out as a leader who doesn’t duck the thorny issues. I agree with his policy intentions but I have significant concerns and appreciate the PM making this a free vote. “It gives me the opportunity to express my personal view, outside collective responsibility. The principle of equality under the law is a fundamental one. It underpins many of my personal beliefs. “We should not treat legally competent adults differently in this way, where people born a day apart will have permanently different rights. Among other reasons it will create difficulties with enforcement.  This burden will fall not on the state but on private businesses. “Smoking rates are already declining significantly in the UK and I think there is more we can do to stop children taking up the habit. However, I do not support the approach this Bill is taking and so will be voting against it.” Along with Mrs Badenoch, five other ministers voted against – Steve Baker, Alex Burghart, Andrew Griffith, Julia Lopez and Lee Rowley. While most of the 106 Tories who did not vote were abstentions, some may have been people who supported the Bill but were absent from the House on business. A source close to Ms Mordaunt, the Leader of the House, said: “She didn’t feel able to support the Bill for many reasons. She sees it as unworkable.” Speaking in the debate, Liz Truss, the former prime minister , who voted against the Bill, said it was “emblematic of a technocratic establishment in this country that wants to limit people’s freedom”. “My fear is this is not the final stage that the health police want to push,” she said. “People want to make their own decisions about what they eat and what they drink and how they enjoy themselves.” She said she was “disappointed” that a Conservative government would bring forward such a “virtue-signalling piece of legislation”. There were enough “finger-wagging, nannying control freaks” on the opposition benches willing to support the proposals, she said, urging Tories to instead “stand by our principles and our ideals”. “I think the whole idea that we can protect adults from themselves is hugely problematic and it effectively infantilises people,” she said. Opening the debate, Victoria Atkins, the Health Secretary , said: “I totally understand the concerns of fellow Conservatives. “We are not in the habit of banning things, we do not like that, and so we will only bring these powers in when we are convinced… that there is no liberty in addiction. “Nicotine robs people of their freedom to choose. The vast majority of smokers start when they are young, and three-quarters say that if they could turn back the clock they would not have started. “There is no safe level of smoking and no safe tobacco product. In fact, it is the only product that, if it is consumed as the manufacturer intends, will kill two-thirds of its long-term users. “That is why, through this Bill, we are creating a smoke-free generation  that will guarantee that no one who is turning 15 or younger this year will ever be legally sold tobacco, saving them from the misery of repeated attempts to give up, making our economy more productive and building an NHS that delivers faster, simpler and fairer care. “I would argue it is our responsibility, indeed our duty, to protect the next generation, and this is what this Bill will do.” On Twitter, Mr Jenrick wrote: I believe in personal freedom. Let's educate more and ban less.I also believe in the principle of equality under the law. A phased ban of smoking would be an affront to that. I will therefore vote against the Tobacco and Vapes Bill. (1/2) He added: “I respect those who disagree. The proponents have good intentions. I’ve seen the harmful effects of smoking in my own family, so I understand their perspective. “But the best way to reduce smoking is to continue to educate, not a ban that will prove a nightmare to enforce.” In the debate, Sir John Hayes, a former Tory minister, said: “The idea of a rolling age of consent, for the consequence that someone of 35 will be able to buy tobacco, someone of 34 not, and so on and so forth, is at best a curiosity and at worst an absurdity.”                      Tim Stanley                    Another liberty disappears in a puff of smoke Sir Simon Clarke, a former levelling up secretary, said the Bill was “fundamentally illiberal legislation” and would lead to “further rights creep”. “I simply don’t understand how it is that a Conservative prime minister thought it was appropriate to bring forward legislation which is the opposite of why we in this House are sent here, which is to defend and uphold the principle of individual choice and individual liberty,” he said. Sir Jake Berry, the founder of the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, said: “If you believe in freedom, you have to accept that I have to be free to make bad decisions as well as good decisions. “If we live in a society where the only decisions we can make are the ones government tell us we can make, you may as well live in Russia, you might as well live in China.” All three voted against the Bill. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said he was “shocked” to see the Conservatives propose a tobacco ban but confirmed Labour was giving its “wholehearted” support to the Bill. He added that his party was “only too happy to defend the Health Secretary against the siren voices of big tobacco” gathered on the Tory benches.                      16 Apr 2024-07:09PM GMT                                         That’s all for today...                    Thank you for joining The Telegraph’s liveblog.                       My colleague Jack Maidment will be back tomorrow morning.                                         16 Apr 2024-06:56PM GMT                                         Penny Mordaunt abstained from smoking Bill vote as she believed it was unworkable                    Penny Mordaunt abstained from voting on Rishi Sunak’s smoking Bill as she believed it was unworkable, The Telegraph understands. It is understood that the Commons Leader felt unable to support the Bill for many reasons. In contrast, her Cabinet colleague Kemi Badenoch went a step further and voted against the Bill, as she said she had “significant concerns” about its approach.                      16 Apr 2024-06:46PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak ‘put this Bill at risk by granting a free vote’ says Labour                    Rishi Sunak of put the smoking Bill “at risk” by putting it too a free vote as he “is too weak to stand up to the Liz Truss-wing of his party”, Labour have claimed. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said in the wake of the Bill passing: “Rishi Sunak put this bill at risk by granting a free vote, because he is too weak to stand up to the Liz Truss-wing of his party. “Labour first proposed a progressive ban on smoking more than a year ago, and it was only thanks to Labour MPs that this bill passed. “If we are privileged enough to form the next government, Labour will implement this ban, so young people today are even less likely to smoke than they are to vote Conservative.”                      16 Apr 2024-06:39PM GMT                                         Serving ministers among those voting against Bill                    Several serving ministers were among those voting against the Tobacco and Vapes Bill. They included Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart, Northern Ireland minister Steve Baker, culture minister Julia Lopez, and communities minister Lee Rowley. Former prime minister Liz Truss and former housing secretary Sir Simon Clarke also voted against the legislation.                      16 Apr 2024-06:27PM GMT                                         More than 100 Tory MPs did not vote in Rishi Sunak’s Tobacco and Vapes Bill                    Over 100 Conservative MPs did not vote on Rishi Sunak’s flagship Tobacco and Vapes Bill. Some of those MPs will have decided to abstain, but others could have a procedural reason for not voting or been unable to attend the vote for other reasons. A total of 57 Tory MPs voted against the Bill, including as expected Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick. Among those who voted against the legislation were deputy Tory Party chairmen Rachel Maclean and Jonathan Gullis. Also voting against the Bill were Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, and Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs.                      16 Apr 2024-05:51PM GMT                                         Rolling tobacco ban ‘biggest single intervention we can make to improve our nation’s health’ says health minister                    The proposed rolling tobacco ban in the Tobacco and Vapes Bill is the “biggest single intervention we can make to improve our nation’s health”, a Government health minister said. Andrea Leadsom told the Commons: “83 per cent of people start smoking before the age of 20, and that’s why we need to have the guts to create the first smoke-free generation across the United Kingdom, making sure that children turning 15 or younger this year will never be legally sold tobacco. “It is the single biggest intervention we can make to improve our nation’s health.” She added: “The case for the Bill is totally clear. Cigarettes are the products that, when used as the manufacturer intends, will go on to kill two thirds of its long term users. That makes it different from eating a McDonald’s.” Ms Leadsom admitted that she had taken up smoking at 14 years old, and gave up the habit “as a 21st birthday present to myself”.  She added that, 40 years later, “I still feel like a fag sometimes...it’s that addictive.”                      16 Apr 2024-05:40PM GMT                                         Labour health minister hits back at Liz Truss’ ‘health police’ jibe                    A Labour health minister has hit back at Liz Truss’ comments that supporters of the rolling smoking ban were “the health police”. Labour’s Wes Streeting earlier in the Commons expressed support for Rishi Sunak’s Tobacco and Vapes Bill. Preet Kaul Gill, a shadow health minister, said: “I simply say that if wanting to stop future generations getting addicted to products that may eventually kill them, makes us the health police, then the health police we are.” Earlier, Ms Truss had said: “My real fear is that this is not the final stage that the health police want to push. They are the health police and people are concerned about this. “They want to be able to make their own decisions about what they eat, what they drink and how they enjoy themselves.”                      16 Apr 2024-05:33PM GMT                                         Jenrick: ‘Let’s educate more and ban less’                    Robert Jenrick has confirmed he will vote against the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, saying that he believes in “personal freedom”.  The former Home Office minister said on X: “I believe in personal freedom. Let’s educate more and ban less.  “I also believe in the principle of equality under the law.

She said that she had “pondered long and hard” about how to vote on the legislation, but said she believed the enforcement of the proposals in their current form was “impossible”. She wrote on X, formerly Twiter: “My granny smoked all her life, the rest of us have always been opposed to it as a result. But her ability to decide for herself is one which I would not want to remove. She added: “I look forward to the next stage of this bill coming back with amendments which will make vaping impossible to glamorise, an 18 or 21 age limit for purchase, and continued work to discourage smoking.” The Smoking & Vapes Bill will have its first outing in the House of Commons this evening. I have pondered long and hard about how to vote and have decided that in its present form I cannot support it. 1/                      16 Apr 2024-04:51PM GMT                                         Kemi Badenoch confirms she will vote against Rishi Sunak’s smoking ban                    Kemi Badenoch has confirmed that she will be voting against Rishi Sunak’s flagship Tobacco and Vapes Bill, saying that she had “significant concerns” with the legislation.The Business Secretary said that the Prime Minister had “honest” intentions with the Bill, and that it marks him out “as a leader who doesn’t duck the thorny issues”.But she wrote on X that she said she did not believe that adults should be treated “differently” with the rolling smoking ban and that she had concerns about enforcement. Smoking rates are already declining significantly in the UK and I think there is more we can do to stop children taking up the habit.However, I do not support the approach this bill is taking and so will be voting against it. (4/4)                      16 Apr 2024-04:40PM GMT                                         Brussels’ police action against NatCon ‘chilling’, says Robert Jenrick                    Robert Jenrick has accused the Brussels mayor of “Putin-esque tactics” in moving to shut down the National Conservatism conference. The former Home Office minister said on X, formerly Twitter: “This is chilling. “The mayor has banned conservatives who articulate the view of millions of people from meeting because he doesn’t like their opinions. “Meanwhile the Labour Party laugh at these Putin-esque tactics. Anyone who believes in freedom of speech should be concerned.” Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, had referenced Suella Braverman attending the event during a Commons debate earlier in the day. He said: “A source close to the Rt Hon member for Fareham, who couldn’t be with us... because she’s currently in Brussels surrounded by the police who are trying to shut down the event she is attending with some far-right fanatics, with whom she has much in common.”                      16 Apr 2024-04:35PM GMT                                         Nigel Farage: Nasty Brussels police have just proven Brexit right                    It was no surprise to me that I wouldn’t be welcomed back to Brussels, writes Nigel Farage. I first got wind that trouble was brewing on Saturday afternoon, when I received word from the organisers of the National Conservative Conference that political pressure was being put on the venue to cancel the rally. A new venue was found, but despite best efforts, that option too was closed off. Having one venue cancel I could live with, but two is absolutely outrageous. Yet we hadn’t even reached the lowest point. On arrival at the third venue, the mood was tense and we were told by security that the police were on their way to stop people from entering! A warm welcome back indeed. The excuse given by officials to harass a peaceful political event “to guarantee public safety” is simply extraordinary. How on Earth could the public be threatened by the speeches of the prime minister of Hungary and leaders of national political parties bidding to win in the upcoming European elections? No, the real threat seems to be ideological: the questioning of Brussels’ “ever closer union”. Holding these beliefs appears to have been enough to attempt to shut the conference down.

Christopher Snowdon, of the free market think tank, said: “A new era of prohibition has begun. No matter how this absurd policy is dressed up, it is a gross infringement on freedom and opens the door to future prohibitions on alcohol, gambling, vaping and so-called junk food. Don’t say you haven’t been warned.”                      16 Apr 2024-04:20PM GMT                                         Sir Simon Clarke: Smoking ban will be a ‘nightmare’ for shop staff                    The proposed progressive smoking ban would be a “nightmare for shop workers” when it comes to enforcement, a former Cabinet minister has said. Sir Simon Clarke told the Commons: “I do also believe in practice it is going to be a nightmare for shop workers up and down the country to be asked to enforce this. “And I do think that it places them in a very invidious position, one which is likely to lead either to them facing real trouble in their shops or to them frankly, passing the buck and ignoring the law and making a mockery of it.” He added: “I simply don’t understand how it is that a Conservative Prime Minister has thought it was appropriate to bring forward legislation which seems to me as the opposite of the reason why we in this house are sent here, which is to defend ever hold the principle of individual choice and individual freedom.”                      16 Apr 2024-04:07PM GMT                                         Former Tory deputy party chairman: ‘What next, a ban on alcohol? A ban on takeaways?’                    Former Tory deputy party chairman Brendan Clarke-Smith has said he “cannot support” the Government’s flagship smoking ban, as he said that the Government should “get back to trusting adults to make their own decisions”.  The MP for Bassetlaw said: “As Margaret Thatcher once said: ‘When people are free to choose, they choose freedom.’ “But what next, a ban on alcohol? A ban on takeaways? I declare an interest in both of those.” He added: “Both of these are bad for us when they’re not done responsibly, but we are adults. These are our choices. These are not the state’s choice. We need to get back to trusting adults to make their own decisions in life. “                      16 Apr 2024-04:06PM GMT                                         Braverman: It’s ‘laughable’ that Brussels ‘thought police’ were sent to shut down NatCon                    Suella Braverman has said it is “laughable” that Brussels “thought police” were sent to shut down the National Conservatism conference. The former home secretary, who was a keynote speaker at the event, wrote on X: “It’s laughable that the Brussels’ thought police were sent out to shut down a conference of democratically elected politicians representing the views of millions of people. “They clearly didn’t want to hear about how we can secure our borders & protect our citizens.”                      16 Apr 2024-04:01PM GMT                                         Defiant peers inflict fresh defeat to Rwanda deportation plan                    Defiant peers have blocked Rishi Sunak’s flagship Rwanda deportation plan by inflicting a fresh defeat,Charles Hymas writes. The House of Lords backed an amendment by 258 votes to 233, majority 25, that the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill has “due regard” for international and key domestic laws, including human rights and modern slavery legislation. The defeat means the Bill will be sent back to the Commons in an extension of the wrangling over the proposed law that aims to clear the way for the first flights to Rwanda. The legislation has returned to the Lords after MPs voted down all the Lords’ amendments in the latest round of “parliamentary ping-pong” in the Commons last night. The Bill and a treaty with Rwanda are intended to prevent further legal challenges to the stalled asylum scheme after the Supreme Court ruled the plan was unlawful. As well as compelling judges to regard the east African country as safe, it would also give ministers the power to ignore emergency injunctions.                      16 Apr 2024-03:37PM GMT                                         What is Rishi Sunak’s smoking ban and who will it affect?                    Rishi Sunak’s flagship smoking ban is being debated by the Commons for the first time on Tuesday amid a backlash to some of his proposals. MPs will have a free vote on the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which would bar anyone born after 2009 from buying cigarettes. Take a look at The Telegraph’s in-depth explainer at Mr Sunak’s plans here.                      16 Apr 2024-03:24PM GMT                                         Downing Street pushes back on Truss’ claims that ‘finger-wagging, nannying, control freaks’ back smoking ban                    Downing Street has pushed back against former prime minister Liz Truss’s attack on “finger-wagging, nannying, control freaks” supporting the Government’s proposed smoking ban. A No 10 spokeswoman told reporters: “I think the Prime Minister would disagree with that. “I think, as he set out right when he first announced this, this is an important change which will save thousands of lives and billions of pounds for the NHS. And the Prime Minister thinks that that is an important thing to do.” Asked why Mr Sunak believes the move is not unconservative, the spokeswoman said: “This has always been a free vote and that’s because he respects that people’s attitudes to smoking is a matter of conscience and that’s why the approach that we’re taking with this legislation has been in line with previous interventions.”                      16 Apr 2024-03:15PM GMT                                         Belgian police moving to shut down NatCon is ‘extremely disturbing’, Downing Street says                    Belgian police action to shut down the National Conservatism conference was “extremely disturbing”, Downing Street has said. A Number 10 spokeswoman said: “Clearly, these reports are extremely disturbing. “The Prime Minister is a strong supporter and advocator for free speech and he believes that should be fundamental to any democracy. “Speaking more broadly to the principle of such events, he is very clear that cancelling events or preventing attendance and no-platforming speakers is damaging to free speech and to democracy as a result. “He is very clear that free debate and the exchange of views is vital, even where you disagree.” The spokeswoman added she was not aware of any plans to raise the issue with the Belgian government.                      16 Apr 2024-02:55PM GMT                                         Clear majority of voters back Sunak’s smoking ban plan                    A clear majority of voters are in favour of Rishi Sunak’s plan to introduce a phased ban on smoking, according to a new Savanta poll for The Telegraph.  A survey conducted between April 12-14 found that almost six in 10 people (59 per cent) supported the ban while just one in five (20 per cent) are opposed to the policy.  Opposition to the ban is highest among younger people.  Some 43 per cent of 18 to 24 year olds said they supported the ban but 28 per cent said they opposed it.  Chris Hopkins, political research director at Savanta, said: “Young people appear to be increasingly libertarian in their views across our research, and this has been shown again with their opposition to the Government’s proposed smoking ban – despite no one surveyed at risk of being impacted by the legislation. “Gen Z are broadly less likely to smoke than older generations, but 18-24 year old’s are the least likely to support the ban compared with every other age group. In fact, over 55s are four times more likely to support the smoking ban than oppose it.”                      16 Apr 2024-02:48PM GMT                                         Sir Sajid Javid backs ‘robust’ plan to ban smoking                    Sir Sajid Javid, the former health secretary, backed the Government’s plan to introduce a phased ban on smoking.  He told the House of Commons: “It is only right that we take robust action to protect future generations from these harmful products.” Sir Sajid criticised MPs who have argued the ban would impinge on personal freedom.  He said: “Can we honestly say that this drug enhances personal liberty and freedom? It is a nonsense argument. Anyone who makes that argument, they are choosing to stand up for big tobacco against the interest of their constituents and to erode someone’s personal liberty and remove their freedom to choose, by using drugs, buy giving them access to drugs. “This drug diminishes economic freedom and it diminishes the wealth of individuals, it diminishes the wealth of our country.”                       16 Apr 2024-02:37PM GMT                                         Don’t back ‘finger-wagging’ measures, Truss tells fellow Tory MPs                    Liz Truss warned her fellow Tory MPs not to support what she described as “finger-wagging” measures like the proposed ban on smoking.  Delivering a message to her colleagues, Ms Truss said: “If people want to vote for finger-wagging, nannying control freaks, there are plenty of them to choose from on the benches opposite and that is the way they will vote.  “And if people want to have control over their lives, if they want to have freedom, that is why they vote Conservative and we have to stand by our principles and our ideals…”                      16 Apr 2024-02:31PM GMT                                         Truss attacks ‘health police’ over smoking ban                    Liz Truss said she feared the Government’s smoking ban would not be the “final stage” of activity by what she described as the “health police”.  She told the House of Commons: “My real fear is that this is not the final stage that the health police want to push. They are the health police and people are concerned about this.  “They want to be able to make their own decisions about what they eat, what they drink and how they enjoy themselves.”  Ms Truss suggested the Tobacco and Vapes Bill was a “virtue-signalling piece of legislation about protecting adults from themselves in the future”.                       16 Apr 2024-02:00PM GMT                                         Truss: Phased smoking ban ‘emblematic of a technocratic establishment’                    Liz Truss, the former prime minister, has described the Government’s phased smoking ban as “emblematic of a technocratic establishment in this country”, as she spoke against the Tobacco and Vapes Bill. Ms Truss said: “The reason I’m speaking today is I’m very concerned that this policy being put forward is emblematic of a technocratic establishment in this country that wants to limit people’s freedom, and I think that is a problem.” She added: “The problem is the instinct of this establishment, which is reflected by a cross-party consensus today in today’s chamber, is to believe that they, that the Government are better at making decisions for people than people themselves and I absolutely agree that that is true for the under 18s. “It is very important that until people have decision-making capability while they are growing up that we protect them. But I think the whole idea that we can protect adults from themselves is hugely problematic and it effectively infantilises people, and that is what has been going on. “And what we’re seeing, is we’re seeing not just on tobacco but also on sugar, also on alcohol, also on meat, a group of people who want to push an agenda which is about limiting people’s personal freedom, and I think that is fundamentally wrong.”                      16 Apr 2024-01:50PM GMT                                         Streeting: Sunak ‘too weak’ to take on Tory MPs over smoking ban                    Wes Streeting has taken aim at Rishi Sunak over party disunity over its flagship smoking Bill, accusing the Prime Minister of being “too weak” to take on arguments from Tory MPs opposing the proposed progressive smoking ban. The shadow health secretary said: “Someone’s got to defend [this Bill] and I get the sense that there aren’t going to be too many on the side opposite. So let me have a go at doing what the Prime Minister is too weak to do and take on the arguments of his own party. “They say the progressive ban on smoking is unconservative. What, let me tell them, what is unconservative… (is) the heaviest tax burden in 70 years and it will get heavier if we do not act to prevent ill health.” He told the Commons: “We happily align ourselves with big health in defence of the nation and we are only too happy to defend the Health Secretary against the siren voices of big tobacco we see gathered around our former prime minister (Liz Truss) in the corner of the chamber.” He added: “A stopped clock is right twice a day, and I find myself agreeing with the former prime minister. This is absolutely an un-Conservative Bill, it is a Labour Bill, and we are delighted to see the Government bring it forward.”                      16 Apr 2024-01:41PM GMT                                         Mordaunt and Badenoch weigh up voting against PM’s smoking ban                    Penny Mordaunt and Kemi Badenoch are both considering voting against Rishi Sunak’s flagship smoking ban on Tuesday evening, The Telegraph understands.

She told the Commons: “What we are saying is, it is already unlawful to sell vapes to under 18s but we want to take the power in this legislation to consult on flavours, design and so on to ensure that vapes are being sold as they should be, as they are intended in order to help adult smokers to quit because no child should veer vape.” She added: “The tobacco industry claims that there will be unintended consequences to raising the age of sale, they assert that the black market will boom. Before the smoking age was increased from 16 to 18, they sang from the same hymn sheet but the facts, I’m afraid, showed otherwise.                      16 Apr 2024-01:20PM GMT                                         Braverman tells NatCon: UK Government ‘doesn’t have the political will to take on the ECHR’                    The British Government “doesn’t have the political will to take on the ECHR”, Suella Braverman has told the National Conservatism conference.  The former home secretary used her conference speech to publicly express that the UK would leave the European Court on Human Rights “now”, calling it “the politically expedient thing to do.” She told the conference: “Regrettably, the UK Government doesn’t have the political will to take on the ECHR and hasn’t laid the groundwork for doing so. “It’s therefore no surprise that recent noises in this direction from the Prime Minister are being dismissed by the public as inauthentic. “It must also be said that any attempt by the Government to include a plan for ECHR withdrawal, or a promise to hold a referendum on the question, in a losing Conservative Party election manifesto would likely set the cause back a generation.” Her remarks came after Rishi Sunak said earlier this month that controlling immigration was “more important” than membership of he convention.                       16 Apr 2024-01:14PM GMT                                         Victoria Atkins: ‘There is no liberty in addiction’                    The Health Secretary has told MPs that “there is no liberty in addiction” in response to arguments from Conservative colleagues that the Tobacco and Vapes Bill on personal freedom grounds. Victoria Atkins told the Commons: “I understand the argument, the concern that we are banning things, I totally understand the concerns of fellow Conservatives, we are not in the habit of banning things, we do not like that and so we will only bring these powers in when we are convinced, following a no-doubt robust debate with the intellectual self-confidence that we have to have such debates on this side of the House, we come to the conclusion that there is no liberty in addiction. She added: “Nicotine robs people of their freedom to choose. The vast majority of smokers start when they are young, and three quarters say that if they could turn back the clock they would not have started.”                      16 Apr 2024-01:05PM GMT                                         Braverman accuses authorities in Brussels of trying to ‘undermine and denigrate’ free speech                    Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, accused authorities in Brussels of trying to “undermine and denigrate” free speech, as police moved to shut down the National Conservatism conference. Speaking from inside the conference, where she is a keynote speaker, Ms Baverman told Sky News: “It’s a real shame that the thought police, instructed by the mayor of Brussels, has saw fit to try and undermine and denigrate what is free speech and free debate. “I remember the words of Mrs Thatcher, I’m going to misquote her, but the more ridiculous and far-fetched and extremist their attempts are to silence us, the more cheered on I am because it just shows that they’ve lost. They’ve lost the political argument.” When asked if she believes something similar could happen in the UK, she said: “What really does concern me here in Brussels is that only last year, the mayor of Brussels was happy to host the mayor of Tehran here in Brussels. “And yet he seems to be pretty offended by democratically elected politicians, people from all over the European continent who are giving voice to millions of people talking about things like securing our borders.” “Could this happen in the UK? I generally think we have a culture of freedom of speech, we value debate and a free flow of ideas. It’s a cherished foundation of our democracy and long may continue.”                      16 Apr 2024-01:03PM GMT                                         Pictured: Angela Rayner and Rachel Reeves visit a housing development in West Sussex                                         16 Apr 2024-12:52PM GMT                                         NatCon organisers claim food and water deliveries being blocked to venue                    Food and water is being blocked from being delivered to the National Conservatism conference as police move to shut it down, organisers have claimed.

The MP for Rossendale and Darwen said in a video on X: “While there may be good things in this, maybe you, like me, agree that children should not be taking up vaping. I am going to be speaking today and opposing the out and out ban for people ever smoking. “And the real reason is that freedom is really important to me as a conservative. And freedom to do just what the Government wants you to do is not freedom at all. He added: “We have to accept that as people grow older, even if they make bad decisions they are still their decision to make.”                      16 Apr 2024-12:45PM GMT                                         Pictured: Farage’s view of ‘current situation’ in Brussels                    The current situation in #Brussels.   pic.twitter.com/65NYR0ox8r                      16 Apr 2024-12:32PM GMT                                         Farage: ‘There is no public order threat in here whatsoever’                    There is “no public order threat” at the National Conservatism Conference “whatsoever”, Nigel Farage has said, as police officers attempt to shut it down.

But he said he had “never seen it acted out” on a broader public stage. He also suggested the attempt to shut down the NatCon conference in Brussels would look bad on the world stage.  He told broadcasters in Brussels: “On an individual scale, yes, I was banned from restaurants, I was banned from pubs, I was even banned from coffee bars, refusing to serve me.  “So I am used to this deep intolerance of anybody with a different point of view. I have never seen it acted out, that was on a private stage, that was just me that they hate, fair enough.  “But this is on a public stage.

Yoram Hazony, the conference chairman, said his team had been told by the venue that it had to pull the event amid “political pressure” from Philippe Close, the Socialist Party mayor of Brussels. Pressure had been growing on Concert Noble to cancel the conference, including from the Belgian League of Human Rights and the Belgian Anti-Fascist Coordination, according to local reports.                      16 Apr 2024-11:47AM GMT                                         Farage: Attempt to shut down NatCon conference is ‘monstrous’                    Nigel Farage described the attempt to shut down the National Conservatism conference in Brussels as “monstrous”.  He said it had further convinced him that the UK leaving the European Union “was the right thing to do”.  Speaking to broadcasters, Mr Farage said: “We have got the prime minister of country coming, we have got a Roman Catholic bishop coming, we have got representatives of parties at the top of the polls all around Europe in elections.  “This is the sort of complete old communist-style thing. You don’t agree with me, you have got to be banned, you are mad, and to be shut down. It is monstrous. “I’ll tell you what , it has done me a favour because at times I think oh, I wish the government had done Brexit a bit better than they have and why haven’t they tightened the borders up.  “But if anything has convinced me that leaving the European Union ideology was the right thing to do it is the events of today.”                      16 Apr 2024-11:42AM GMT                                         Farage blasts attempt to shut down NatCon conference in Brussels                    Nigel Farage suggested the attempt to shut down the National Conservatism conference in Brussels amounted to a “modern, updated form of communism”.

And the reason this is doubly problematic is that the great majority of smokers wish they never started, but they become addicted at an early age and then they’re trapped and their choice has been taken away by that addiction. “This is one of the reasons why the argument that if you’re pro-choice, you’re in favour of cigarettes is so surprising because this is a product which is designed to take your choice away from you.” He added: “The aim of this legislation, as you say, is to ensure that no children 15 or below actually become addicted to smoking, or at least cannot be legally sold cigarettes, and we do expect that over time to lead to essentially smoking dying out almost completely, which would be an enormous public health achievement.”                      16 Apr 2024-09:16AM GMT                                         Reader poll: Do you support the Government’s smoking ban?                    MPs will vote this evening for the first time on Rishi Sunak’s plan to introduce a phased ban on smoking.  The policy has prompted a revolt from some Tory MPs who are opposed to the ban on freedom grounds. Many believe the policy is unconservative. But what do you think? You can have your say in our reader poll below:                      16 Apr 2024-09:10AM GMT                                         Lord Hague: Liz Truss returning as Tory leader ‘definitely not a good idea’                    Lord Hague said another Liz Truss premiership is “definitely not a good idea” after she said she had “unfinished business” at the top of politics.  Lord Hague, the former leader of the Conservative Party, rubbished the suggestion that Ms Truss could return.  He told Times Radio: “I am not in general in favour of former leaders having another go at being the leader, having experienced being the leader of the party myself and I certainly never wanted another go.  “It is definitely not a good idea to have another go if it was a particularly catastrophic episode when you were the leader. “So no, I don’t think that would be a good idea. But there is a debate, let’s acknowledge, as in all political parties and it has often happened in the Labour Party, there is a debate about its future orientation and she has shown she is going to be part of that debate. I will happily take the other side of the debate.”  Ms Truss yesterday refused to rule out running for leader of the Conservative Party again. She suggested that “it’s never wise to rule anything out in politics”.                      16 Apr 2024-08:58AM GMT                                         Position on Islamic Revolutionary Guard ‘not fixed’, says minister                    A Home Office minister said the Government’s stance on the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was “not a fixed position” amid calls for the UK to proscribe the group.  Laura Farris told LBC News that “a range of sanctions remain under review” and “this isn’t the fixed position, but at this point in time I did notice that the Foreign Secretary was talking about the value of that direct line (to Tehran)”. She added: “I don’t think there’s any disagreement, actually, on the principle. “We’re not for a second defending the IRGC. We’re simply saying that maintaining that channel with Tehran at this moment in time is, at present, in our national interest.”                      16 Apr 2024-08:42AM GMT                                         Truss: ‘I can’t see a purpose for the UN as it stands’                    Liz Truss has suggested the United Nations should be abolished as she claimed it was not fit for purpose in its current form. The former prime minister, who served as foreign secretary under Boris Johnson, accused the UN of playing a “damaging” role in the Israel-Gaza conflict. Ms Truss told the BBC’s Newscast podcast: “I can’t see a purpose for the UN as it stands. At present it has been very ineffective at dealing with international situations, in fact positively damaging, for example, on Israel.” Asked whether she wanted to abolish the UN, she replied: “I do recommend abolishing quite a lot of things in my book. I’m not a UN fan. I think the best use it has is actually a meeting point for governments.”                      16 Apr 2024-08:32AM GMT                                         Pictured: Angela Rayner leaves her London home this morning                                         16 Apr 2024-08:20AM GMT                                         Big day in Westminster for two of Sunak’s flagship policies                    The Rwanda Bill returns to the House of Lords today for further scrutiny while MPs will vote for the first time on Rishi Sunak’s proposed smoking ban.  The House of Commons removed all of the amendments made by peers to the Rwanda Bill last night and the upper chamber is expected to try to make further changes to it this afternoon as the “ping-pong” process continues.  Meanwhile, the Tobacco and Vapes Bill is scheduled for its second reading debate-the first major hurdle all new Bills must clear on the path to becoming law.  The smoking ban Bill is expected to pass but it looks like Mr Sunak will suffer a Tory revolt over the plan.  The Rwanda Bill debate should get underway in the Lords at about 4pm while the vote on the smoking ban should take place at 7pm.                       16 Apr 2024-08:08AM GMT                                         Pictured: Lord Cameron arrives in Downing Street for weekly Cabinet meeting                                         16 Apr 2024-08:04AM GMT                                         Whitehall had EU ‘Stockholm Syndrome’ after Brexit, claims Truss                    Whitehall had a case of EU “Stockholm Syndrome” after Brexit because it was so used to being a “supplicant” to Brussels, Liz Truss has said.  The former prime minister said that officials were used to “looking to Brussels for validation” and that needed to change.  Stockholm Syndrome describes a situation in which a captive develops positive feelings towards their captor.  Ms Truss told Nigel Farage during an interview on GB News: “Given that we have decided to leave the European Union, the consequence of that is we need to become more dynamic, more nimble, more competitive. We need to get rid of all the EU laws straight away.  “We need to get on with doing trade deals with our allies. We made a decision and that has huge consequences.  “We’ve had a Whitehall that’s been shaped by being in Europe, essentially supplicants to Europe, and it’s almost like Stockholm Syndrome… officials are constantly looking to Brussels for validation and all of that needed to change.”                      16 Apr 2024-07:49AM GMT                                         Minister: Smoking ban is ‘very sensible policy’                    A Home Office minister who took up smoking at the age of 12 said she would back the plan to ban young people from ever legally being able to buy cigarettes. Laura Farris rejected the criticism of the plan from some senior Tories including former prime ministers Liz Truss and Boris Johnson, telling LBC: “I think this is a very, very sensible policy and I’m not particularly interested in arguments about freedom on this one.” The minister said: “It took me years and years and years to quit. It’s one of my biggest regrets, actually. I’ve got two young kids now and the fact that they will never be able to walk into a shop and buy a packet of cigarettes is something I welcome. “I have never met a single smoker who’s glad they did it, wishes that their children do it, can identify a single health benefit or any other life benefit. “It gets you hooked. It’s a horrible habit. And even when you’re doing it, you know that you’re causing yourself irreparable harm. And it’s incredibly difficult to get off.”                      16 Apr 2024-07:36AM GMT                                         Polling expert: Nearly two-thirds of public back smoking ban                    There is “really significant” public support for Rishi Sunak’s smoking ban, a think tank expert and pollster has said as MPs prepare to vote on the Prime Minister’s proposals later today. Luke Tryl, the UK director of More in Common, said support for Mr Sunak’s plan, which includes a year-on-year increase in the smoking age, was particularly high among 2019 Tory backers. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The top line finding is there is really significant support for this phased smoking ban. We find that nearly two-thirds of the public back a ban and what’s particularly interesting is among those who voted Conservative in 2019, support is even higher, 71 per cent of that group back a ban. “It’s got really significant support among those voters that the Conservatives desperately need to get hold of. There’s this myth that has emerged that the public are pseudo-libertarians… people like the Government taking tough measures, particularly on public health and particularly on things that affect children and young people. “If you ask people about a general smoking ban, they say I’m not sure how that’s enforceable, I’m not sure about how it’s going to work. But the idea of doing it for the future generations, this idea that it’s a phased ban… This measure that the Government is putting forward is particularly popular.”                      16 Apr 2024-07:25AM GMT                                         Use education and tax to curb smoking, argues Tory MP                    There is “more than one way to crack a nut”, Sir Simon Clarke said as he said smoking should be curbed through taxation and education rather than prohibition.  The senior Tory MP told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “In the end we are sent to Parliament to make decisions and to follow our conscience and this is a conscience vote for the Conservative Party.  “I don’t think that this is the right way to go about stopping the next generation from smoking.  “That is a laudable goal but there is more than one way to crack a nut and I think that it is far better for us to focus on education and the tax system as tools to stop people from smoking than trying to introduce bans.”                      16 Apr 2024-07:16AM GMT                                         Smoking ban is unconservative, says ex-Cabinet minister                    A ban on smoking is unconservative, Sir Simon Clarke said this morning as he set out his opposition to Rishi Sunak’s plan.  Sir Simon, a senior Tory MP and former Cabinet minister, said he believed the ban on young people smoking could end up being the “thin end of a wedge” which leads to other unhealthy things being banned.  It was suggested to Sir Simon during an interview on BBC Radio 4 Today that people would have used the same arguments against the ban on smoking in pubs.  But he said: “I think there is quite a significant difference between saying that it shouldn’t happen indoors, in pubs and clubs, and then the state saying outright you cannot do something.  “Philosophically I think that is an undesirable place for us to be because I think we ought to be talking in terms of both education and using the tax system to deter young people from starting smoking.  “I don’t think that an outright ban is a Conservative thing to do. I think it is the thin end of a wedge which once allowed in will then start to spiral to lots of other things, so let’s have an outright ban on fast food or an outright ban on alcohol. Once you start on the business of stopping people from doing things which are unhealthy for them that is the definition of a slippery slope.”                       16 Apr 2024-07:09AM GMT                                         Sunak’s ban ‘risks making smoking cooler’, warns Sir Simon Clarke                    Rishi Sunak’s plan to introduce a phased ban on smoking risks making it “cooler”, a former Cabinet minister has warned.  Sir Simon Clarke argued the ban could fuel a black market and create an “unmanageable challenge for the authorities” to enforce it.  The former levelling up secretary made the comments as MPs prepare to debate and vote on Mr Sunak’s plan for the first time later today.  Mr Sunak’s Tobacco and Vapes Bill will make it illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone born after Jan 1 2009.  Asked if he was sceptical of the ban or downright opposed to it, Sir Simon told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “Both sceptical and downright opposed, I think it’s fair to say, because the truth is that we all agree that smoking is a very bad thing and that no young person ought to start.  “That is something which I think the science is unequivocal on, anyone who has spent any time talking, as I have, to doctors in the NHS about this will be in no doubt of the social and economic and health consequences of smoking.  “But there are good ways to tackle a problem like this and then there are bad ways and I think that an outright ban risks being counterproductive, I think it actually risks making smoking cooler, it certainly risks creating a black market, and it also risks creating an unmanageable challenge for the authorities.” Load-Date: April 17, 2024  End of Document
