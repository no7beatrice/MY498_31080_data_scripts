   LEO MCKINSTRY: How my vain attempts to find a builder in Brittany lay bare the reasons Brexit Britain is powering ahead of the sneering French MailOnline December 27, 2023 Wednesday 9:55 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: DEBATE; Version:1 Length: 1258 words Byline: Leo Mckinstry Body   Ever since the vote for Brexit in 2016, the Remain lobby has been peddling its gospel of gloom about Britain's inevitable decline because of our supposed isolation on the global stage. Yet their dire warnings have never materialised. On the contrary, the UK has shown astonishing resilience during a period of turbulence that has included the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the energy price hike. Far from sliding into meltdown, the economy is performing impressively on a number of fronts: inflation has fallen dramatically, public finances have stabilised, Government revenues are buoyant, and wage growth is outstripping price rises. The upbeat mood was encapsulated in the words of the highly respected banker Jamie Dimon of the global giant J.P. Morgan during a summit at Hampton Court. Once a stubborn critic of Brexit, Dimon - who is now an admirer of Britain's approach - told the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt: 'You guys are doing great.' Superstate Meanwhile, there is a rich irony at the heart of this success: Britain is on course to widen its economic lead over France, the chief architect of European integration and the strongest opponent of the UK's independence. Like Remoaners, the French political class was convinced that Brexit would be a disaster for Britain. In this narrative of disdain, we would shiver on the sidelines while the Paris government advanced towards its destiny of building a Gallic powerhouse at the heart of a federal superstate. But it has hardly worked out like that. Only yesterday, a report by the accountancy giant PwC argued that growth here in 2024 will outpace that of Germany, Japan and France. This upbeat prediction was in line with a study earlier this week from the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) which forecast that the UK economy will be 10.2 per cent larger than that of France by 2033.

According to the CEBR, the key explanation for this disparity is the greater tax burden in France to pay for its bloated public sector. As its new report states, French tax as a proportion of national economic output - or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - was 45.1 per cent in 2021 which 'stands in stark comparison to the UK's ratio of 33.5 per cent'. The heavier taxes needed to sustain 'the expansive French state over recent decades', claimed the report, had resulted in a 'comparatively less dynamic private sector and lower GDP growth rates in contrast to the UK'. In effect, the vast, sclerotic machine of the French state is both costing a fortune and undermining enterprise. That matches my own experience of France, where my wife and I are lucky enough to own a house in a remote village in Brittany. It is a land of breathtaking beauty, magnificent historic architecture, wonderful cuisine, and a rich sense of pride in its cultural heritage. But its greatness is undermined by the sprawling civic bureaucracy, whose appetite for taxpayers' money and addiction to excessive regulations is causing real economic damage. It is impossible to escape a sense of decay in much of rural France. Many of the towns and villages around us are full of boarded-up shops, while nearby cities like Rennes have growing numbers of homeless people. Yet in the face of this malaise, it is not easy to employ people because of the high costs imposed by the state. I have lost count of the number of times that I have contacted a local firm for a quote on work on our Brittany house or garden. Despite arranging a visit, they never turn up, fail to give a quote as promised or reject the job after initially agreeing a price. As a rule of thumb, for every euro that is paid in wages, another euro goes to the government. It is little wonder, then, that joblessness remains stubbornly high in France, with the unemployment rate going up from 7.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year to 7.4 per cent in the third quarter, compared to a rate of 4.3 per cent in Britain. The erosion of the work ethic is further fuelled by the welfare system, which is one of the most comprehensive in Europe and provides substantial payments to people out of work. President Emmanuel Macron came to power in 2017 promising to make social security reform one of his priorities, but he has had only limited success, partly because the vested interests in defence of the status quo - led by the trade unions and Left-wing pressure groups - are so powerful. Indeed, so wedded is France to this culture of dependency that even Macron's sensible move to raise the state retirement age from 62 to 64 - which is still lower than in Britain - caused an explosive controversy and violent hostility on the streets earlier this year. Deadweight The huge public sector payroll represents one of the citadels of opposition to change. It, therefore, continues to be a deadweight on the economy, riddled with outdated working practices and systematic abuses. In one outrageous case in the southern port of Toulon, a group of 10 civil servants were paid their salaries for 25 years for literally doing nothing after the water industry in the city was privatised. In another, 40 members of the Academie Francaise were found to be enjoying lavish perks, including properties and top-of-the-range cars. One senior Academie official was paid £94,000-a-year and given a free flat. This remuneration was reportedly justified on the grounds that the post had forced her to give up her work as a historian, but in fact she had authored no fewer than nine books since her appointment. Entitlement was also displayed by the civil servant who headed France's broadcasting archives and spent £29,000 on taxis in 10 months, despite having her own chauffeur and a private car. Oozing energy and youthfulness, President Macron promised a shake-up of France's economic structure so the country would become more competitive. Plagued But like many of his predecessors, he has floundered on the rocks of reaction. The workforce remains too featherbedded, too shielded from economic realities and too focused on its own demands rather than the economy. Sick leave, maternity rights and redundancy packages are among the most generous in the world. Civil servants are entitled to 42 days paid holiday-a-year, while all workers have a right to a minimum of five weeks' vacation. Tellingly, France has 12 Bank Holidays compared to England and Wales's eight. But all this generosity has not brought harmony or prosperity. France is still plagued by strikes and its national debt stands at 115 per cent of GDP. When public and private debt are combined, the total reaches a staggering 361 per cent of GDP, compared to 289 per cent in Britain. Sneering at our country has long been one of the French establishment's pastimes. When Nicolas Sarkozy was in office, he proclaimed that 'the UK has no industry any more'. Yet, in September, the UK overtook France to become the world's eighth largest manufacturer. And our success in pulling ahead of France is not the only good news in the CEBR report. By 2038, we're also expected to gain ground on Germany. When you're doing better than the country widely reputed to be Europe's economic powerhouse you must be doing something right.
