He has vowed to partly fund a new “elite” border unit as he set out his plans to stop small boats crossing the Channel. In a speech at Dover, the Labour leader accused the Conservatives of operating a “Travelodge amnesty” by housing asylum-seekers in hotels rather than processing their claims. He was accompanied by new Labour MP Natalie Elphicke , who has slammed the Tories approach on boats just days after defecting from the party.  Speaking about her admission, he said the move represents the “mood of the country” as Rishi Sunak is “clinging on by his fingernails” to power. During the press conference, the opposition leader hasn’t ruled out letting Nigel Farage join the Labour Party. It comes after as government lawyers have confirmed the first deportation flights as part of the Rwanda  scheme could take off in June.

The first asylum seekers were originally set to be flown out of the ground in July. But court documents have now revealed that flights could take off in June. Government lawyers said: “In the prime minister’s press conference on 22 April he said the first flight would leave in 10 to 12 weeks. The 10th week after 22 April starts with the week commencing 24 June.“We are instructed that this is the earliest possible date for the first removals and that the decision on the precise date will be based on operational considerations and progress over the coming weeks.”18:23 , Jane Dalton We are now putting our coverage of UK politics on hold for the night, resuming soon.Comment: The economy climbs out of recession – but, hold on, there may be a catch…18:00 , Salma Ouaguira The strength of the UK’s emergence from recession came as a surprise even to the City – but, says James Moore , finally turning the corner makes a cut in interest rates less likely. 'Scottish independence can be delivered in five years,’ says John Swinney17:40 , Salma Ouaguira Scotland’s first Minister has toldSky Newsthat the “answer” to their problems including the cost-of-living and Brexit. When asked whether independence can happen in five years, Mr Swinney told the broadcaster: “I think independence can be delivered in that timescale because the arguments for it are compelling.“If we look at two of the biggest issues we face as a country in Scotland: the effect of the cost of living and the implications of Brexit.“Both of those major strategic factors that are doing severe economic and social damage to Scotland are because of bad decisions taken in Westminster, and independence is the answer to that.”Rwanda flights could come as soon as June as Starmer slams Tory ‘gimmicks’17:23 , Jane DaltonThe earliest possible date for flights to Rwanda is 24 June, government lawyers have told the High Court :Rwanda flights could come as soon as June, court documents suggest Labour ‘not interested in repatriating people', Starmer says17:20 , Salma Ouaguira Addressing the government’s Rwanda plan becoming law, Sir Keir said: “They will get flights off the ground – I don’t doubt that.”He added that Mr Sunak is likely to get “a couple of hundred” migrants to Rwanda before the election “for party management”.But, asked by The Independent what would happen to those deported to Rwanda in the coming months once Labour scrapped the plan, he said Labour was “not interested in repatriating people”.Starmer will stop Rwanda flights right after general election17:05 , Salma OuaguiraSir Keir Starmer  has toldSky News he will act fast and cancel Rishi’s deportation flights to Rwanda as soon as he wins the general election. If he gets elected, the opposition leader said he will stop them even if “they carry with it “a cheque” to the African government.He added: “Every flight that takes off carries with it a cheque to the Rwanda government.“So I want to scrap the scheme -so that means the flights won’t be going.”Labour will stop Rwanda deportation flights, Starmer promises16:46 , Salma Ouaguira While Rishi Sunak sets up a date to fly asylum seekers  out of the country, Keir Starmer said he will scrap it all together if he is crowned Primer Minister. During the Dover conference, the Labour leader promised voters: “We will scrap the Rwanda scheme.“I said that to you when we last met last week, the time before last and you know, that means ending the scheme. Absolutely. Flights and all.”No more gimmicks.Labour will stop the chaos. Labour will bust the backlogs.

Ben Houchen, the Tory Mayor of the Tees Valley, has also urged Mr Sunak to get a grip of his party as he warned the “public do not vote for parties who are not united”.Asked about both Lord Houchen’s comments and Ms Elphicke’s defection said: “What he (Houchen) said was divided parties don’t win elections and we need to pull together as a Conservative Party.“I think that when you see we are behind in the polls, unfortunately some colleagues do lose their nerve.” Labour accuse Rishi Sunak of ‘out of touch victory lap’ after UK exits recession16:24 , Salma Ouaguira Mr Sunak claimed that “things are starting to feel better” hours after figures showed the economy had grown by 0.6 per cent over the first three months of this year, Kate Devlin  writes.

He added: “Punching through the backlog, having more law enforcement officers do more, that’s all happening already”.“We’ve announced all of that more than a year ago,” the prime minister adds.“The question for Keir Starmer if he cares so much about that, why did he vote against the new laws that we passed to give our law enforcement officers new powers?“They’ve now used those to arrest almost 8,000 people connected with illegal migration, sentenced them to hundreds of years in prison.“And if it was up to him, all those people would be out on our streets, so I think it’s rank hypocrisy property of his position.”Let’s recap...15:44 , Salma Ouaguira If you’re joining us now here’s what you’ve missed:Sir Keir Starmer has outlined a plan to curve small boats crossings and crack down on people smugglers.

CEO of the Refugee Council Enver Solomon said:“Whoever is in government must focus beyond anything else on running a fair and effective asylum system that actually processes people’s claims. “The current system is in meltdown, with thousands of people shut out of the asylum process and living in indefinite limbo. “Men, women and children from countries such as Afghanistan and Syria with clear protection needs face endless uncertainty, while those whose claims have been refused are not being supported to return to the countries from which they came.”Dominic Cummings plans to replace the Tories15:01 , Salma Ouaguira Beyond defections and seat losses, the Tories have a another problem to worry about.Former advisor to Boris Johnson Dominic Cummins has unveiled a ‘Start-Up Party’ that could rival the Conservative Party.The anti-establishment party leader has been organising focus groups to explore voter’s views. He previously said he wants the party to be “credibly anti-insider” to “replace the Tories”.Watch: Government’s ‘failed’ asylum system offers false hope to migrants, says Starmer14:40 , Salma Ouaguira Sir Keir Starmer  said the UK’s failed asylum system has turned refugee camps into a “job-centre for modern slavery” as he outlined Labour ’s plan to stop small boat crossings on Friday 10 May.The Labour leader delivered a speech  on the Kent coast in which he attacked the government ’s current approach as “rank incompetence” and dismissed the Rwanda scheme.Sir Keir also recalled a visit to a refugee camp on the outskirts of Calais in 2016 and described the situation as a “monumental failure”.“People had been brutally let down,” he said.“Not just in terms of the truly awful conditions but also because the failure of our asylum system had encouraged a false hope.”In full: Keir Starmer attacks ‘unquenchable Tory thirst for gimmicks’14:25 , Salma Ouaguira The Labour leader attacked Rishi Sunak’s approach to the small boats crisis as ‘gimmicks, not serious government’ and set out the party’s own plans to crack down on people smugglers.He promised “a new politics” on everything from small boat crossings to the economy , saying: “The character of politics will change, and through that, we will deliver higher growth, safer streets, an NHS back on its feet, more opportunity in your community, cheaper bills in your home, and secure borders for our nation.”Click here for the full story Politics explained: How ‘The Independent’ killed off Nadhim Zahawi’s political ambitions14:15 , Salma Ouaguira The ‘boy from Baghdad’ believed he could be prime minister, says Sean O’Grady.

The former Tory MP ignited a huge wave of backlash after comments defending her ex-husband emerged. Jess says the apology was “an absolute start, but is also a bare minimum”.She added: “I’m going to give her a chance to talk to me personally. There is a part of that statement about abuse and harm that he caused to her as well.“I’m not saying that to excuse her. I am saying that because I think that she provides us with a lesson of how we could actually prevent this going forward and have some sort of cultural shift. “So I don’t excuse her and I will give her, like I would with any woman, I will give her a fair chance.”Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper hits back at Cleverly13:48 , Salma Ouaguira Earlier today James Cleverly posted a statement slamming Keir Starmer for his approach on small boats crossings. He posted the comment with a snap of an FT article titled “Yvette Cooper urges ‘immoral’ UK to take 10,000 refugees”.The shadow Home Secretary has now clapped back.Er, James…… This is your Government’s policy to help 20,000 Syrian refugees, announced just after this article! Which 4 days later you welcomed!! “I welcome David Cameron’s announcement that the UK will provide sanctuary to thousands more Syrians” https://t.co/8RLMEYDiGo  ‍️ https://t.co/5es1F2kzDP — Yvette Cooper (@YvetteCooperMP) May 10, 2024 Meanwhile in Scotland...13:38 , Salma OuaguiraLabour small boat crossing plan ‘absolute joke' says Chancellor13:28 , Salma Ouaguira Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has slammed Sir Keir Starmer’s plan to curve small boat crossings.Speaking onLBC, he said: “I mean, you know what they want to do is they want to cancel the Rwanda policy. “That we are now seeing beginning to work because we’re getting reports from people in Ireland saying they don’t want to come to the UK because of the risk of being flown to Rwanda.”‘Elphicke said UK should open fire on the French if they don’t accept returned small boats,’ Tory MP says13:14 , Salma Ouaguira Tory MP Michael Fabricant revealed he spoke with Ms Elphicke at a Christmas event in which she said the Royal Navy should “open fire” on the French Navy if they do not accept small boats being returned.He adds that Ms Elphicke wanted to see small boats being “nudged back”.Speaking about her defection to Labour, Mr Fabricant said it was “amazing” to see her alongside Sir Keir Starmer.And that Ms Elphicke isn’t a “good fit” in the Labour Party -and that she “wasn’t a good fit in the Conservative Party either”, he said. Starmer’s plan ‘already being done,’ Tory MP says12:54 , Salma Ouaguira Conservative MP Michael Fabricant said Sir Keir Starmer’s plan top stop small boat crossings is nothing new. He said all his promises “are things that the government and other agencies are already doing”.Sir Keir Starmer’s plan will ‘protect human rights’12:45 , Salma Ouaguira Labour’s immigration policy would “align with global rules that protect individual human rights,” Sir Keir Starmer said.He added: “Our rules-based system should align with global rules that protect individual human rights.“That is in our interests and the right thing to do.”Elphicke says Tories ‘cannot be trusted’ days after defecting from party12:35 , Archie Mitchell Ex-Tory MP Natalie Elphicke has said Rishi Sunak “failed to keep our borders secure and cannot be trusted” only two days after leaving the Conservative Party. In a savage attack on her former boss, the Dover MP said: “Nowhere is Rishi Sunak’s lack of delivery clearer than on small boats.“We are failing to keep our borders safe and secure, lives are being lost in the English Channel while small boat arrivals are once again at record levels.“It is clear that Rishi Sunak has failed to keep our borders secure and cannot be trusted.”Introducing Sir Keir Starmer ahead of a speech on border security, Ms Elphicke said “a fresh approach is needed” under the Labour Party.She said Sir Keir would build a Britain of “hope, optimism, opportunity and fairness” that “everyone can be part of”.In pictures: Sir Keir Starmer’s small boats crossings speech12:22 , Salma OuaguiraMeanwhile in Downing Street...12:46 , Salma Ouaguira Rishi Sunak has slammed pro-Palestinian protests and boycott calls over Israel’s Eurovision appearance. Downing Street  said the prime minister urged demonstrators to consider the feelings of Israelis and Jewish Eurovision fans watching the scenes “in the aftermath of what was an atrocious terror attack and while hostages are still being held by Hamas”. Click here to read the full story A day before Starmer’s promises, hundreds crossed the English Channel12:06 , Salma Ouaguira Provisional figures from the Home Office  revealed 211 people were detected crossing the Channel on Thursday. Figures show cumulative number of arrivals by small boats in 2024 now stands at a provisional total of 9,037.This is 35% higher than the total at this point last year, which was 6,691, and 16% higher than the total at this stage in 2022, which was 7,801.Three boats were detected on Thursday, which suggests an average of around 70 people per boat.There were 29,437 arrivals across the whole of 2023, down 36% on a record 45,774 arrivals in 2022.In context: Starmer says Rwanda scheme costs taxpayers billions11:46 , Salma Ouaguira Sir Keir Starmer has criticised Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda deportation scheme  for costing taxpayers “billions”.Let’s take a look at the numbers: The government initially committed £290 million to the troubled scheme. According to the National Audit Office (NAO), there will be millions more in spending, including £11,000 for each migrant’s plane ticket. While Rwanda will get £20,000 for each asylum seeker relocated there and a £120 million top-up once 300 have arrived.Read James Cleverly’s statement in full11:34 , Salma Ouaguira In a statement, Mr Cleverly says: “Labour have no plan to stop the boats.“Labour have an illegal immigration amnesty, Labour blocked of the deportation of violent sexual offenders and Labour voted over 130 times against tougher legislation to stop the boats.“They will create a haven for criminal gangs, not stop them. Even Labour MPs are saying Labour can’t be trusted to stop the boats which shows you nothing will change.“If people can apply for asylum from outside the UK then unlimited claims can be made, many of which will have to be accepted under the law and even then, many of those declined will then get on a small boat anyway.“Labour’s announcement would make the UK the asylum capital of the world.”‘Labour will make UK’s asylum capital of the world,’ Home Secretary says11:32 , Salma Ouaguira Sir Keir Starmer has hit hard on the Conservative’s Rwanda scheme dubbing it “an insult to intelligence”. But just minutes after his speech, where he set out his small boat crossings plan, the Tories have clapped back. Home Secretary James Cleverly says Labour’s system “would make the UK the asylum capital of the world.”Watch: Sir Keir Starmer’s small boat crossings speech in full11:26 , Salma Ouaguira Watch Sir Keir Starmer ‘s speech on Labour ’s small boat policy from Dover  today. Labour will use new counter-terrorism powers to tackle people-smuggling gangs bringing migrants  across the Channel, Sir Keir announced.In full: Rwanda policy is not a deterrent to illegal immigration, Starmer says11:24 , Salma Ouaguira Sir Keir Starmer said the Rwanda policy is not a deterrent to illegal immigration. But processing claims and sending people back to their countries of origin is.He said: “Stopping the gangs getting people in boats is the most effective deterrent because you can’t actually make the crossing to get here.“The biggest deterrent is that it’s a pointless exercise and you go back where you started.”Sir Keir said he would get rid of the Rwanda policy immediately and that some aspects of scrapping it require legislation and some do not.There will be a “fast timetable to get this off the ground,” he said.In full: Starmer says Elphicke’s defection represents mood of the country11:13 , Salma Ouaguira During his speech in Dover, Sir Keir Starmer was asked whether he was concerned about the backlash from within the Labour Party.He responded: “This is a very important and significant crossing of floor for reasons Natalie set out.“I think anyone reading the words she set out this morning would be persuaded this is a very significant thing, you’ve got a Tory party that is losing votes, losing MPs, losing councillors, losing mayors across the country.“It’s a Conservative Party that is on its last legs, it’s out of road, out of ideas, and that is why I genuinely think the mood of the country and Natalie has picked up on this, is for change and a general election.No one can understand why Rishi Sunak is “clinging on by his fingernails” to power, he said.Sir Keir Starmer’s speech on small boats has ended11:06 , Salma Ouaguira If you’ve just joined us now here’s a quick summary of what happened: Sir Keir Starmer said he does not doubt the Government will get flights running to Rwanda but said the flagship deportation policy would not work as he insisted “our asylum system must be rebuilt”.He aid Labour will end the Rwanda policy permanently and establish a border security command that will be an “elite force, not a Cinderella service”.The Labour leader added turning a blind eye to people smuggling was “not a progressive or compassionate position” as he outlined his plans to tackle small boat crossings.On returning to countries of origin10:51 , Salma Ouaguira Starmer says: “It is perfectly possible possible to return people to the country of origin rather than the EU.”But he clarifies Labour will not be returning to the European Union. Deal with the Taliban?10:50 , Salma Ouaguira A reporter from the Exrpress asks about whether Keir Starmer will be working with the Taliban. Poeple who came from Afghanistan are escaping from the Taliban to “find safety”, Starmer responds. He adds:“But we shouldn’t overestimate the difficulty here.”Watch: Government’s ‘failed’ asylum system offers false hope to migrants, says Starmer10:46 , Salma Ouaguira Sir Keir Starmer  said the UK’s failed asylum system has turned refugee camps into a “job-centre for modern slavery” as he outlined Labour ’s plan to stop small boat crossings on Friday 10 May.The Labour leader delivered a speech  on the Kent coast in which he attacked the government ’s current approach as “rank incompetence” and dismissed the Rwanda scheme.Sir Keir also recalled a visit to a refugee camp on the outskirts of Calais in 2016 and described the situation as a “monumental failure”.“People had been brutally let down,” he said.“Not just in terms of the truly awful conditions but also because the failure of our asylum system had encouraged a false hope.”‘I’m not going to flog a dead horse’, Starmer says10:43 , Salma Ouaguira If he wasn’t clear enough, Starmer vows the Rwanda scheme will be totally scrapped.He says it is a gimmick that costs tax payers millions. Nigel Farage joining Labour?10:40 , Salma Ouaguira Sir Keir Starmer denies Nigel Farage joining the Labour Party.He said that the former UKIP leader is “the last person who’d want to join the Labour Party” and a “list of names doesn’t help anyone”.With Westminster just recovering from the lates defection, that would be the last straw for Labour MPs already furious about Elphicke joining. Starmer says Rwanda bill is an ‘insult to anyone’s intelligence'10:38 , Tom Barnes He said: “A scheme that will remove less than 1% of arrivals from small boat crossings a year can not and never will be an effective deterrent. “It’s an insult to anyone’s intelligence and the gangs that run this sick trade are not easily fooled.” The Labour leader is taking questions from the press10:36 , Salma Ouaguira Starmer is asked about not recreating the Rwanda scheme. He replies it is not “compassionate” to allow those perilous journeys. He vows to tackle people smugglers as his top priority. He adds: “We will scrap the Rwanda scheme, It is not going to work, it is an absolute waste of money.”‘An end to the chaos,’ Starmer vows10:33 , Salma Ouaguira Concluding the speech, Starmer says: “No more gimmicks. “The character of politics will change and through that, we will deliver higher growth, safer streets, an NHS back on its feet, more opportunity in your community, cheaper bills in your home, and secure borders for our nation.“An asylum system – rebuilt. The criminal gangs – smashed. The exploitation of some of the most vulnerable people in the world – prevented.An end to the chaos. A turning of the page. A politics returned to service, and a careful, patient, determined renewal of our country with Labour. “That is the future you can choose. That is what serious government can deliver.”‘Politics will change,’ Starmer says10:32 , Salma Ouaguira Starmer promises to turn the tables and improve the status quo if he gets the keys of Downing Street. Addressing voters he says: “If I am elected to serve this country, if I earn that privilege, I will turn the page on Westminster’s ‘talk tough do nothing culture’”‘Politics of practical solutions’10:30 , Salma Ouaguira Starmer says: “A question: can you prioritise, at all times, the politics of practical solutions, and can you reject the politics of performative symbols, the gimmicks and gestures. “This is the story of what has happened to the Government, the explanation of how a party that cares about illegal migration – there’s no doubt about that -finds itself with a record of failure as total and stark as this.”Plans will face resistance, says Labour leader10:29 , Salma Ouaguira Sir Keir Starmer admits the plans, which promise to improve the current system, will be hit by backlash. He proceeds: “These plans will be fiercely resisted, of course they will. That is par for the course on this issue.“I have no doubt that the British people fully support a rules-based asylum system. “No doubt that the fair-minded majority want a system that can secure Britain’s borders and uphold this country’s fine tradition of providing sanctuary for people fleeing persecution.”Like hotel California: ‘never leaving’10:28 , Salma Ouaguira Starmer claims 100,000 people are currently in permanent backlog.He says: “Even if they have absolutely no right to be here – they cannot be removed -billing the taxpayer for expensive hotel accommodation.“Because like Hotel California, there is no prospect of ever leaving and no prospect of a decision for or against.”A ‘Tory short-cut,’ Starmer criticises Rwanda10:25 , Salma Ouaguira He says: “So it’s not hard to see why the Prime Minister might want a path to deterrence, without the hard graft – the boring graft perhaps -of fixing the wider system. “But I’m afraid, like so much of what he says these days, it’s magical thinking, a symbol of an unquenchable Tory desire for the short-cut. “The easy-fix, the sticking plaster, gimmicks not serious government.”‘We will find you and we will stop you,’ Starmer says10:24 , Salma Ouaguira Sir Keir Starmer says shores will become hostile territory for people smugglers. He slams: “We will find you, we will stop you, we will protect your victims, and with Border Security Command, we will secure Britain’s borders.”People smugglers will be treated like terrorists10:22 , Salma Ouaguira Starmer says: “That means new powers that, as with would-be terrorists, can be used pre conviction with High Court approval and that can limit the ability of the gangs to conduct their vile business – before arrest. “Powers that will allow us to shut off internet access, close their bank accounts, trace their movements – using information provided by the intelligence services. “Or powers like stop and search at the border. Or raiding and seizing evidence -before an offence has taken place.”Further Europe partnership will be back10:21 , Salma Ouaguira Sir Keir Starmer says: “We can co-operate across borders, that’s not some kind of weakness, it’s absolutely essential. These criminals do not respect national boundaries. “When I was at the Crown Prosecution Service we had prosecutors posted in Pakistan working on counter-terrorism operations. In the Caribbeanon smuggling. “In West Africa, disrupting the flow of drugs coming from South America on their way to Europe and ultimately to Britain.”‘Not a Cinderella service'10:20 , Salma Ouaguira Starmer will hire front-line defence to tackle people smuggling. Border Security Command will bring together hundreds of specialist investigators. The best of the best.Workforce will include the National Crime Agency, the Border Force, Immigration Enforcement, The Crown Prosecution Service, and MI5. Starmer sets out the plan10:18 , Salma Ouaguira He says: “Britain can do better. Labour will do better. We will end this farce. “We will restore serious government to our borders, tackle this problem, at source, and replace the Rwanda policy permanently.”Rwanda scheme is a ‘gimmick’, Starmer says10:16 , Salma Ouaguira Sir Keir Starmer says: “But the question this record must raise is whether the latest gimmick, the Prime Minister’s Rwanda scheme, can really be taken as a serious solution to this important challenge? I don’t think so. “They will get flights off the ground – I don’t doubt that. But I also don’t doubt – that this will not work. “A policy that will see just a few hundred people a year removed to Rwanda, less than one per cent of the people who cross the sea in small boats every year, less than one per cent – for six hundred million pounds... that is neither an effective deterrent or a good use of your money.”Starmer splashes figures10:15 , Salma Ouaguira He says: “Over 8,000 people have made the perilous journey across the Channel in small boats this year. On track to surpass the record set in 2022.”‘Asylum system must be rebuild'10:14 , Salma Ouaguira Sir Keir Starmer adds: “This problem must be tackled. “These gangs must be stopped, our asylum system must be rebuilt, our borders must be secured.”‘Children are dying in our waters,’ Starmer says10:13 , Salma Ouaguira He said: “The children dying in our waters. Just three weeks ago – a seven year old girl... That all remains.“So no matter how good anyone thinks their intentions are, turning a blind-eye to this business, not understanding how important a rules-based asylum system is for tackling that exploitation, for removing the criminal business-model if you like -that is not a progressive and compassionate position, it is the complete opposite of a progressive and compassionate position.”Starmer was in the Calais refugee camps in 201610:12 , Salma Ouaguira Sir Keir Starmer was left “profoundly depressed” by the state of the refugee camps. He added: “The ground was sodden with mud and human waste. I saw the children there – the same age as my own, huddling together in flimsy tents that offered almost nothing in the way of warmth.”‘Gravest challenge we face as a nation,’ Starmer says10:10 , Salma Ouaguira Sir Keir Starmer said: “Tackling organised crime is always hard, especially across borders. I know that from my work at the Crown Prosecution Service, on drug smuggling or counter-terrorism operations. “And let’s be clear at the start – this is a criminal enterprisewe are dealing with. “A business that pits nation against nation, that thrives in the grey areas of our rules -the cracks between our institutions, where, they believe, they can exploit some of the most vulnerable people in the world with impunity. “A vile trade -that preys on the desperation and hope it finds in its victims. The common humanity that ultimately it seeks to extinguish.”Sir Keir Starmer is here10:08 , Salma Ouaguira The Labour leader is addressing the crowd. He welcomes Natalie Elphicke to the Labour Party, despite the backlash he received in the last days. ‘We cannot let them get away with it,’ Shadow Home Secretary says10:07 , Salma Ouaguira The Shadow Home Secretary vows to go hard on people smugglers. She calls them “terrorists” and promises to make use of terrorism policies to stop them.
