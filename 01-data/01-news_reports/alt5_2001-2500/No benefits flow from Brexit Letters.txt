   No benefits flow from Brexit; Letters Ipswich Star August 31, 2023 Thursday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Archant Community Media Ltd All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 22 Length: 263 words Body   WITH (business and trade secretary) Kemi Badenoch desperately trying to cobble together a deal with India - a gesture that she presumably hopes can be sold as a justification of Brexit - the comparison with Liz Truss as she tottered between one American state and another in a bid to cobble something together there is inescapable. There is still no deal with the US and every president told us there wouldn't be. But we wouldn't listen. Central to India's demands is a massive increase in UK visas. After all, since Brexit we have a huge labour shortfall to fill, from agriculture to IT, and India would like to plug the shortfall. But there is a deal imbalance here and, as always, our deals favour our new partners, not us. Sadly, there is a big difference between countries like India and the one we had with the EU. Whereas our EU deal was based on reciprocation, for example whereas Portuguese citizens could work and live in the UK, and contribute to our economy, we could do likewise in Portugal. We could stay there as long as we liked, either working or in www.retirement.No 90-day restrictions and no red tape. None. The difference between what we once had and what is now being served up as a 'Brexit dividend' is massive. Are such benefits that we afford countries in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa offered to us? No. We cannot live and work indefinitely, own property as easily as at home, and retire. There is no reciprocation. So, I'm at a loss. What was the point of Brexit? With all the lies now laid bare can anyone point to a single benefit? RICHARD HARE, Woodbridge. Load-Date: August 31, 2023  End of Document
