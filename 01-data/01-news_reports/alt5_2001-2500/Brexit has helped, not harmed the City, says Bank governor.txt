   Brexit has helped, not harmed the City, says Bank governor Scottish Daily Mail October 5, 2023 Thursday Edition 1, Scotland  Copyright 2023 Associated Newpapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 12 Length: 217 words Byline: John-Paul Ford Body   THE governor of the Bank of England has hailed the opportunities created by Brexit, saying it has 'protected' Britain. In an interview with Prospect magazine, Andrew Bailey said: 'We have protected, and in a sense ensured, that much of the market and much of the industry remains here. And that's been important.' Mr Bailey said Britain 'will have to work even harder to make sure we don't become isolationist'. But it was a sharp change of tone from that of his predecessor Mark Carney who, in the run-up to the Brexit referendum in 2016, said Brexit would be Britain's 'biggest domestic risk', a statement he later retracted. The governor did not brush over setbacks which he said were likely to have been caused by Brexit but suggested they could be overcome. 'If you reduce the openness of an economy, in the short run it will have negative effects,' he said. 'It will have a negative effect on productivity, it will have a negative effect on growth... 'In the longer run, those trading relationships adjust in the real economy and we build new trading relationships.' Mr Bailey also acknowledged the potential benefits of breaking free of Brussels' regulation. 'I support what the Government is doing to think through how to make best use of those opportunities,' he said. 'That's the right thing to do.' Load-Date: October 5, 2023  End of Document
