   Brexit bad for the majority The Journal (Newcastle, UK) September 21, 2023 Thursday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 22 Length: 280 words Body   I THINK it's shameful that hard-line Brexiters haven't shown the slightest remorse or made any apology for the damage they have inflicted on the people of the www.UK.No apology to those who suffered the anguish of losing their business and who had to make loyal workers www.redundant.No apology for the fact that the extra red tape and delays has led to price increases making the cost of living crisis even www.worse.No apology to those who are suffering both physically and mentally due to the increased shortage of workers in the NHS and care homes and no apology to future generations that won't enjoy the benefits that past generations had from the UK being a member of the European Union. I could go on but, as recent polls show, more and more people are realising that Brexit is an overall disaster and the country and its people will never be as well off as they would have been if they had remained in the EU, although hardline Brexiters will of course continue to offer us jam tomorrow. The lifestyles of the leading Brexiters, I'm talking about the likes of Farage, Johnson, Gove, Rees- Mogg et al, as well as all those in the right-wing media with their lies and misinformation, will not have changed for the worse, unlike that of the majority of our population. We were told emphatically that we would all be better off after Brexit and the exact opposite is the case. I notice that all of those I mentioned are very quiet on the subject of Brexit these days, I wonder why? As a Labour supporter I believe that in most instances if right-wing Tories support something it is going to be beneficial for 'the few', not 'the many' and Brexit is a prime example of this.
