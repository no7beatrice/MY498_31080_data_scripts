   New visa joy for Brits with holiday homes as Spain joins France in calling for the post-Brexit 90-day visit limit to be axed, admitting it is harming their economy MailOnline November 15, 2023 Wednesday 3:11 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:2 Length: 671 words Byline: Elena Salvoni Body   French senate voted to give Brit homeowners automatic right to a long-stay visa Brits who own second homes in Spain may soon be able to stay longer than the post-Brexit 90-day limit, with the Spanish government joining calls to axe the unpopular rule. Under the law, Britons can stay in their holiday homes for just 90 out of every 180 days. In order to stay longer, they must apply for a long-stay visa of up to six months. Now, the Spanish government has admitted that the rule, which limits how long British travellers can spend in European Union countries without a visa, is negatively impacting Spain.  'Unfortunately, the rule is not something Spain has established by itself or can get rid of,' the country's acting Minister of Tourism, Hector Gomez said. 'It is in our interest to lobby and convince the EU that we can try to work an exception with them. But the solution must come from them.'  It comes after France's senate voted through an amendment to the immigration law that will give British second homeowners the automatic right to a long-stay visa, after politicians there said UK tourists had been 'punished by Brexit'. Andrew Hesselden, Campaign Director and founder of '180 Days in Spain', which campaigns for Brits' free movement in the country, told the Majorca Daily Bulletin that he is 'delighted to see French senators recognise the injustice of the situation that British part-year residents have found themselves in since Brexit'. He added that his campaign's members 'remain hopeful of similar recognition in Spain for everyone affected'. Now developments appear to be happening in Spain, with Gomez confirming earlier this week that he had held an 'important meeting' with the UK's Director of Consular Affairs and Crisis, Jennifer Anderson, at the Foreign Office.  The pair 'discussed issues of interest regarding the stays of British tourists in Spain and discussed collaboration projects for future seasons,' he said. This is understood to have included the 90-day cap. The UK is Spain's biggest and most profitable tourism market, with almost double the number of Brits visiting the country than German tourists last year. Data from Spain's National Institute of Statistics (INE) shows that two million people travelled to Spain from the UK last year, constituting 23.8 per cent of the total number of visitors.  Under Schengen Area rules, non-EU citizens, including those from the UK, entering the territory under the visa-free regime can only stay for a maximum of 90 days out of every 180 days. Those who overstay, be it intentionally or unintentionally, can face hefty penalties in Spain, including fines of up to (EURO)10,000 and jail terms. They could also be subject to deportation and entry bans, with the post-Brexit restrictions proving a nightmare for thousands of Brits with properties across Spain and France.

'The Britons I have spoken to say the current system is long-winded, difficult and full of pitfalls,' she said, according to The Daily Telegraph. She also said that the rules are keeping them from contributing to France's economy, and that the restrictions will already add to the rising number of vacant properties in the country's popular tourist regions. 'Ties are warming between France and the UK following the royal visit,' she said. 'And don't forget, King Charles reserved his only official speech for the French Senate. 'The British are privileged partners of France. History has shown this to be the case.' The amendment to the law still needs to be debated in France's National Assembly (the country's lower house) before it can be passed, and is being opposed by Emmanuel Macron's government.
