It comes after the stars clashed in the camp last night as their bitter feud reignited. Former UKIP  leader Nigel felt the wrath of First Dates ‘ Fred multiple times in the past with the maitre d branding him a “coward” and a “liar”  on social media in the aftermath of the Brexit  vote. Fred  is a diehard remainer, whilst Nigel  may have done more than anybody else to win a Brexit vote.                      But now it’s been revealed that Fred’s youngest daughter asked him if they would have to leave the country after Brexit.  Last night tensions were high when the topic inevitably came up in camp. Fred asked Nigel: “What is the benefit of Brexit then?” If you are an average person from Britain, what’s the benefit?” Nigel said: “To know that we’re independent, we stand on our own two feet in the world.”  Fred said: “Brexit was about immigration, I remember your poster. I thought it was shameful what you did, Nigel. Shameful.”  Nigel replied: “Sadly, sadly it was absolutely true. It was a poster showing mass young men moving illegally across borders.”  Fred said: “But it was about demonising migrants.” Nigel replied: “No it wasn’t. In your view it was, but it wasn’t.”  To which Fred said: “It’s not only just my view.”  Fred who has lived in the UK for 30 years, said that he will need to apply for “settled status” in order to remain in the country after Brexit. “I remember coming here, being a foreigner but never feeling a foreigner, ” Fred said during an appearance on Loose Women. “But I remember my daughter, who was 11 at the time, saying, ‘Daddy, do we have to leave?’ I have to apply for my settled status or the unsettling status as I call it. I don’t believe in the idea.” He added that he doesn’t think it’s “going to be good for the country” and he believes the UK will be “poorer as a result”.
