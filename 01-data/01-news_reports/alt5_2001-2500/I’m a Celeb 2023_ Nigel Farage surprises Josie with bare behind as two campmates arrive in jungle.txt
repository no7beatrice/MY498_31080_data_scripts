Ant explained: “This is Don’t Drop The Ball. Using only your mouths you have to move the balls from one end of the Scarena over the obstacles to the other end of the Scarena. The first coach to get five balls will be the coach of the Home team. And they’ll go to main camp and enjoy a lovely meal tonight. The loser will be the coach of the Away team.” Dec added: “You can only move one ball at a time… you may have noticed these are no ordinary balls, these are pigs’ testicles.”                      Welcome, Tony and Frankie... and now you have to put pigs’ testicles in your mouths!

Arriving at the new “Scarena” they found out they were to take on the “Locker Shocker Trial”. Ant explained: “This is Locker Shocker. The rules are very simple; you’ll each be placed inside one of the lockers in front of you. The first five to finish the Trial will form one team. The remaining five will form the other team. “Inside each locker there are five stars locked to the bottom of the mesh. What you have to do is, using the keys, you’ve got to unlock the stars and then move them up through the mesh maze and out and into the yellow collection slot. But, not every key works. When you’ve collected all five stars, all you’ve got to do is step outside of your locker.” Dec added: “And be prepared, there might be a few surprises along the way.”                      It’s challenge time...

Considering he’s nearly 60 it ain’t too bad.” Danielle replied: “He looks good doesn’t he? Nice little bum.” Danielle in the Bush Telegraph admitted: “It was the weirdest feeling seeing Nigel Farage’s a**e first thing in the morning.” Standing together Josie and Danielle said in sync: “Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No… it’s Nigel Farage’s a***!”                      One camp becomes two!                    Will Fred and Nella be on the same team? Eeek...

In the lead-up to the general election in 2010, Farage suffered a punctured lung, two chipped vertebrae, several fractured ribs and a fractured sternum  after the aircraft plunged to earth. At the time, the controversial politician was the leader of Ukip  and was beginning his Brexit  campaign to encourage the nation to back the ‘Leave’ campaign to exit the European Union.

However, the 2023 premiere, which saw a new crop of stars enter Australian jungle , had an audience peak of 7.8 million, and an average of just seven million. While this makes it the biggest entertainment launch across any channel, it was still down from the peak of 10 million, and average of 9.1 million, who watched the launch episode in November 2022. Viewers are attributing the dip to the inclusion of controversial ex-politician Nigel Farage.

Find out the full story below: I’m a Celebrity: Farage reveals injuries after plane crash while flying Brexit banner                      What did Nella say to Nigel Farage when she confronted him about immigration?                    Nella Rose faced a dilemma when she and Nigel Farage bonded during their first Bushtucker Trial on Monday. She felt conflicted about this since the controversial politician is known for espousing right-wing views on subjects ranging from immigration and the gender pay gap. She decided to confront Nigel about it on Wednesday night, asking him: “Let’s get everything out in the open. All the tea is coming out now… apparently you’re anti-immigrant?” Nigel tried to shrug it off, saying: “If you came with me through South London, you’d be astonished.” Nella asked: “So everyone hates you for no reason? Not that everyone hates you, that was so bad. Sorry.” Nigel: “You can disagree with somebody, but to chuck around accusations the way they’ve been chucked around is grossly unfair. Anti-immigrant, right? No, no, all I’ve said is we cannot go on with the numbers coming to Britain that are coming.” Nella said: “I’m one of the numbers?” Nigel replied: “So that’s it then, should it be 5 million a year, 10 million… you don’t seem to understand.” Nella said: “Those immigrants that are coming in, I came in.” Nigel insisted: “Hang on! Think!” Nella asked: “What is so wrong about immigrants?” Nigel said: “Listen. Since 2000, the British population has increased by 10 million. 10 million.” Nella said: “Good thing, right?” Nigel replied: “Good thing, unless you want a GP appointment…” Nella asked: “I’m stopping you getting a GP appointment? You’re not getting an appointment because the NHS is lacking funding. I bet you anything if every single immigrant or from immigrant descent was to leave the UK, all your doctors, go… most of your doctors are Asian right? Most of your nurses are African women, right? “You want us gone, that’s all I understood.” Nella said to Nigel: “My main point was that we’ve got into this jungle and I really like you and I want to know why everyone hated you. We don’t have to come to a common ground. You probably like a lot of things that I don’t like. And I probably like a lot of things that you don’t like…we can have these conversations.”                      Nigel Farage reveals why he’ll be exempt from some Bushtucker Trials                    Nigel Farage  has revealed that his health issues will prevent him from taking part in certain Bushtucker Trials during his stint on I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here.

Teamwork should hopefully make...dream-work?                      The campmates are lucky have chef Fred Sirieix in camp...                    Meanwhile, Nella continues to avoid Fred and refuses to eat the food he cooks following their argument yesterday night. I’m a Celebrity’s Fred Sirieix and Nella Rose butt heads after ‘dead father comment’                      Nella Rose confronts Nigel Farage over immigration policies in 2016 campaign                    Nella Rose faced a dilemma when she and Nigel Farage bonded during their first Bushtucker Trial on Monday. She felt conflicted about this since the controversial politician is known for espousing right-wing views on subjects ranging from immigration and the gender pay gap. She decided to confront Nigel about it, asking him: “Let’s get everything out in the open. All the tea is coming out now… apparently you’re anti-immigrant?” Nigel tried to shrug it off, saying: “If you came with me through South London, you’d be astonished.” Nella asked: “So everyone hates you for no reason? Not that everyone hates you, that was so bad. Sorry.” Nigel: “You can disagree with somebody, but to chuck around accusations the way they’ve been chucked around is grossly unfair. Anti-immigrant, right? No, no, all I’ve said is we cannot go on with the numbers coming to Britain that are coming.” Nella said: “I’m one of the numbers?” Nigel replied: “So that’s it then, should it be 5 million a year, 10 million… you don’t seem to understand.” Nella said: “Those immigrants that are coming in, I came in.” Nigel insisted: “Hang on! Think!” Nella asked: “What is so wrong about immigrants?” Nigel said: “Listen. Since 2000, the British population has increased by 10 million. 10 million.” Nella said: “Good thing, right?” Nigel replied: “Good thing, unless you want a GP appointment…” Nella asked: “I’m stopping you getting a GP appointment? You’re not getting an appointment because the NHS is lacking funding. I bet you anything if every single immigrant or from immigrant descent was to leave the UK, all your doctors, go… most of your doctors are Asian right? Most of your nurses are African women, right? “You want us gone, that’s all I understood.” Nella said to Nigel: “My main point was that we’ve got into this jungle and I really like you and I want to know why everyone hated you. We don’t have to come to a common ground. You probably like a lot of things that I don’t like. And I probably like a lot of things that you don’t like…we can have these conversations.”                      Nigel Farage hints to campmates he could be future PM                    In a chat with Made in Chelsea star Sam Thompson, controversial politician Nigel Farage was quizzed on his view on the current state of British politics, and whether he would go for being the PM himself. Sam asked: “Who is your favourite prime minister ever in your lifetime?” Nigel said: “Really, in my lifetime, two prime ministers who’ve been really strong, who’ve changed the country: one’s Thatcher and one’s Blair. I didn’t like the way Blair changed the country at all but I have to admit he was a strong leader. Margaret was a very strong leader. They were tough times, but she changed the country completely.” EastEnders star Danielle Harold then asked Nigel: “Would you ever want to run?” Nigel didn’t rule it out, stating: “I don’t know. We’ll see. Depends how much of a mess the country gets in. I honestly don’t know. It’s not an easy job.” Speaking to Bush Telegraph, Farage said: “Never say never...”                      Jamie finally has a swing in her step!                    Jamie Lynn admitted her campmates wouldn’t have expected her to get all 10 stars saying. “I think they were saying, ‘You’re going to do it’ but thinking, ‘No way, she’s been crying for five days straight, it ain’t happening’ so I’m really, really happy that I get to come back and bring them the joyous 10 stars.” She added: “I might cry a lot but I can come and do this.”                      Jamie Lynn Spears proves campmates wrong with impressive comeback challenge                    Jamie Lynn spoke to herself as she went along saying as she reached the 5th level, 90ft in the air: “I just want to be done with this.” But surprisingly, when she reached 100ft in the air, Jamie Lynn walked out onto a plank before jumping to catch the final 10th star! Good going, Jamie.                      Jamie Lynn Spears could be triumphant in sky-high challenge,,,                    Jamie Lynn Spears is making light work out of the sky-high challenge up to 90ft in the air. She has encountered green ants and all sorts of creepy crawlies. Ant exclaimed: “Look at that, she’s rapid! She’s not bothered!” As she tackled a see-saw mid-way through, Dec added: “Light on her feet!” Could she surprise her campmates and win all of the stars?                      Go on Jamie...                    Dec explained: “You have to climb from the bottom to the top of that rig, collecting the stars as you go. Every time you unclip a star, you clip it to yourself. Each star you collect is worth a meal for camp. You’ve got 10 minutes to make your way up there. You can expect a few surprises along the way.” Jamie Lynn insisted: “I want to do the trial.” Ant joked: “You can say, ‘No thanks, y’all!’”                      Jamie Lynn Spears takes on the ‘Climb of Cruelty’ as Danielle Harold ‘bets’ that actor will bow out of competition today                    Jamie Lynn is up for the next trial. Can she do it? EastEnders star Danielle Harold has said she doesn’t think Jamie will last the day before she quits the show altogether. Meanwhile, the uber-positive Sam Thompson thinks Jamie will step up to the challenge. Jamie Lynn insisted: “I’m not gonna let y’all down!”                      ‘If Jamie left yesterday, I would have been right behind her,’ says Nella as she threatens quitting the show                    YouTuber Nella Rose told food writer Grace Dent that she doesn’t usually follow through with things, suggesting that this mentality might influence whether she decides to stay in the I’m a Celeb jungle… Nella told Grace: “I’ve never, ever in my life started something and finished it. Ever. I always quit, or I always sign on short term or if I don’t like it I can leave… this is the one thing I said I’m going to try and stick it through but I can already see myself… if I get in my head too much…” Grace asked: “Do you bolt, you run the minute things start to pick up?” Nella said: “When I was younger I was put in a lot of situations that I had no control over. I was sad and miserable. So now that I have the control over my happiness and the things I want to do I think I’m kind of, I’ve become obsessed with it: ‘Oh, you don’t have to do this if you don’t want to.’” Nella then told Bush Telegraph that whenever she feels uncomfortable or sad, she tends to run away from her problems. Nella told Grace: “I used to have so much discipline but that was when I was in a bad space. Lack of self discipline got me from a size 12 to a size 20. Literally my dad passed, I locked myself in the house for two months, I drank every single day and ate every single day and I gained it all and it was pandemic.” Nella admitted: “If Jamie left yesterday I would have been right behind her… I’m leaving. I just don’t want to be the first.”                      There will be no Bushtucker Trial vote tonight because all 10 of them will be taking part in a challenge later...                    But the campmates don’t know it yet!                      Fred Sirieix and Marvin Humes plan to release a song called ‘Jungle Living'                    Featuring a verse from Nella Rose... Meanwhile, Josie got a bit distracted by Marvin’s abs.                      Josie thinks she hears ‘e-masturbation’ instead of ‘emancipation’                    Er...                      The real reason why contestants wear red socks during the show                    With all those red socks hanging out to dry at camp... it makes you think: Why are all their socks the same colour? During the show, campmates are likely to be bitten by all kinds of creepy crawlies, including leeches and to spare viewers from seeing such unsettling blood marks on contestants, they are required to wear red socks to mask it.

With the campmates predicting that Jamie Lynn might bow out tonight, how will she do in the trial?                      How will Jamie Lynn Spears do in tonight’s sky-high challenge?                    Jamie Lynn Spears has been open about the emotional distress she is facing while at camp, specifically missing her two daughters back at home. Her campmates have been doing their best to comfort her, but Spears has been adamant that she does not want to be in the jungle any more , like when she claimed “I quit” in last night’s episode. But the actor has been voted by the public to take part in tonight’s Bushtucker Trial titled the ‘Climb of Cruelty’. How will she do?

The actor will have to collect stars for camp as she takes on a sky-high trial. In last night’s episode, Lynn Spears begged to go home to her children as she lost out on winning her luxury item: a framed picture of her two daughters. The Zoey 101 star has had an emotional few days as she’s grappled with homesickness. But campmates, including reality TV star Sam Thompson and JLS’s Marvin Humes, have tried to cheer her up by serenading her and giving her several pep talks.                      Fred Sirieix and Nella Rose butt heads after comment ‘about dead father’                    Nella Rose and Fred Sirieix  have butted heads on I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here over a perceived slight about her late father. In scenes aired on Tuesday’s episode , the online content creator expressed her distaste for a comment the First Dates maître d’ made in reference to his age. While Sirieix was preparing food for the campmates’ dinner, he batted off compliments that he wasn’t “old” at age 51 by comparing his age to Nella’s. “Yeah, but I’m not 26 anymore, am I? I could be your dad,” he reasoned.

In the Bush Telegraph, Nella explained: “Last night after dinner Fred made a comment about him basically how he could be my dad. I took offence to that because one of the first conversations we had together was me opening up about the fact that my dad’s passed away.” She continued: “I didn’t say anything about it last night because I was kind of just annoyed about it. So I slept on it and I kind of thought about it and I was just like, this is not the kind of person I want to be around.” Nella decides to ignore Fred during breakfast to make a point, before asking him to ‘leave’ her alone. Fred realised he had upset Nella and asked her what he had done. Nella explained he’d made a comment the day before, saying: “You know that my mum’s dead, and you know that my dad’s dead. You know that, right? I’ve come to find out that every time I wanna get creative around the fire, or I want to have something my way, my own food that I am entitled to, my way, you tend to get an attitude, right?” Fred replied: “I am so sorry. Can I just say? First of all, I am sorry I’ve offended you. I am unaware that you felt offended. I am unaware that what I said would lead to this conversation, I only said that in a way because I am older than you, I am 51 and you’re 26.” Nella said back: “I’m not stupid, you’re not going to little girl me, you’re not.” Nella said she had accepted his apology but concluded that the pair should not be friends.

I’d always said to the boys, ‘I really like her, I think she’s hot’.’” “We went to a nightclub in Ireland after doing a show together one night and we were just chatting, getting on really well. She went to the toilet, right? She left her handbag at the table with me. So then, I thought, right, got her phone out and called myself so I had her phone number. It took about three months of pestering her to get a date.” He said that their first date was at McDonald’s car park in Wembley. ”Three and a bit years later, three kids… I’m very, very lucky.”                      Sam Thompson admits he took Zara McDermott on first date to Sticks’n’Sushi                    The pair met after Love Island star Zara McDermott slid into the Made in Chelsea star’s DMs...
