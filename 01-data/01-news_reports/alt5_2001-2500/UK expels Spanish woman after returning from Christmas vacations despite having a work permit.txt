   UK expels Spanish woman after returning from Christmas vacations despite having a work permit CE Noticias Financieras English January 7, 2024 Sunday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC. All Rights Reserved Copyright 2024 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved Length: 934 words Body            A 34-year-old Spanish woman has been expelled from the UK after returning from her Christmas vacation in Malaga despite presenting border officials with a document giving her the right to work in the country.          The Spanish citizen was sent back to our country after being stopped at Luton airport on December 26 and after being warned that she was "wasting her time" if she considered that her Home Office documentation, the equivalent of the Home Office in the UK, that she was showing was valid.          Alistair Strathern, the Labour MP representing the Mid Bedfordshire constituency outside London in the House of Commons, has said he is seeking explanations from the Home Office about what happened.          "I traveled home because my sister had had a daughter and on my return, four days later, at Luton airport in London, I was taken to a detention room, taken my belongings and my phone and told to wait there. I spent the whole night there and the next morning they put me on a plane back to Spain," explains Maria, whose name has been replaced by The Guardian.          The expulsion that has left Maria in shock illustrates the risks faced by EU citizens whose documentation to remain in the UK under the Brexit deal has not been definitively validated.          The young woman's husband has also traveled to Spain after border officials warned Maria that she will not be able to return to the UK for a month.          "I was due to return to work, but now my life has blown up. I have everything in the UK: my dog, my belongings, my car.... I was working as a trainee veterinary nurse, which was my dream. If I now try to go back after the first expulsion it will be worse."      A procedure affected by the pandemic          Maria, a designer who was shifting her working career to working with animals, had made a late application for residency under the Brexit deal in 2023 and was living until December with her husband and in-laws in Bedfordshire.          Her application was rejected in June on the grounds that she had not offered sufficient evidence of her status, but she had applied for a review of that decision and had a certificate of application (certificate of application, CoA) issued by the Home Office. This certificate states that the holder "may work in the UK until she receives a decision on her application under the EU agreement".          "I could have told the border agents that I was a tourist, but I am not and I had nothing to hide, so I told them that: I am waiting for the response to my application for review and, therefore, I am still working in the UK."          She explains that the agent who intercepted her, who happens to be the same one who let her enter the UK after stopping her and consulting a colleague in August, told her on this occasion that her documentation was not valid.          "She told me that I was 'wasting my time' and that it wasn't 'true' that I could continue working in the UK. I replied that my papers said so and that there would have to be some hole in the system if she was now telling me that this was not true."          Maria lived in the UK between 2014 and 2018 and recently returned to the country after a paper in South Africa where her husband was studying for his PhD. COVID confinements prevented both of them from being able to return to the country during the pandemic.          The rules state that, given the circumstances, Maria can make a late application for her work and residence permits under the UK-EU Brexit agreement, but that she must demonstrate that her disassociation from the UK was not so long as to invalidate the rights under the pact.          Border agents refused her return to the UK after spending Christmas in Spain on the grounds that "her request under the EU-UK agreement has been rejected" and that she "does not have the right to be admitted" under protection of the agreement that allowed European citizens to remain in the country after Brexit.          Maria, who is taking legal advice, rejects that version and points out that the certificate she received after requesting a review of her case clearly states that she has the right to work in the UK until she receives a definitive answer.          The Labour MP who is following the case says that "it is essential that to ensure that borders are secure and that citizens can feel confident in the work of border agents that they act in accordance with the law." "It appears that in this case the standard has not been met and there is a discrepancy that I am prepared to take this matter all the way to the Home Office."          Consulted by The Guardian, the Home Office assures that the element at issue for those seeking to enter the country with a certificate of application or CoA is not whether they have the right to work in the UK, but whether they provide sufficient evidence that they have the right to be in the country under the Brexit agreement with the EU.          Those who are refused entry to the UK "are liable to be detained pending their departure from the country," although that "does not amount to being subject to a deportation order, which would prevent re-entry to the UK."          Border Force's number one priority is to keep our borders secure and we will never compromise on this," explains a Home Office spokesperson.          "Officers will be able to detain any passenger arriving in the UK for further scrutiny if they are not immediately satisfied that they are eligible for entry. This decision is made on the basis of the information provided by the passenger, not their nationality."      Load-Date: January 8, 2024  End of Document
