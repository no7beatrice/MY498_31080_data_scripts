When Britain voted to leave the EU in 2016, there were 7,130 Spanish citizens working in the NHS, according to parliamentary figures. But this fell to 5,114 by last June. The number of Spanish nurses fell from 4,675 in 2016 to 1,467 last year. Brexit led to a shortfall of 330,000 people in the labour force as foreign workers left, according to a report published last January by thinktank the Centre for European Reform and UK in a Changing Europe. After 20 years in Britain, Magda Martínez moved back to Spain last summer. A senior nurse earning £50,000 per year, she still had to do two extra shifts on intensive care at weekends to ensure the family made ends meet in London. Brexit also meant her sick mother could not receive NHS treatment if she lived with the family in London. "The day of the Brexit vote, I felt that we were being kicked out of our own home. I had my life here, but I was not welcome," Ms Martínez, 49, who now lives in Valladolid, in northern Spain, said. She added: "We had the feeling the cost of living crisis got worse and worse and you think: 'What am I doing?'" Diego Ayuso, secretary general The Spanish the UK down in of the Spanish General Council of Nursing, said fewer Spanish nurses were moving to work in the UK because of Brexit. He said Britain was less attractive for nurses than other EU countries because if they returned to Spain their experience abroad does not count under an EU points system. of nurses in year, 4,675 2016 Eva Alonso, 50, a mortgage broker, says the cost of living in Britain made her decide to head home to Malaga with her British partner, Steve Hankins. "It is also the quality of life, which is better in Spain," she said. "Lots of my friends are heading home." Mr Hankins said he wanted some "sun on his back" and the punishing cost of staying in his own country had driven him out. The couple, who live in Cheam, in south-west London, have seen their gas and electric bills rise from £150 per month to £500 while their mortgage payments have increased from £330 to £1,600. 1,467 The number of Spanish nurses in the UK last year, down from 4,675 in 2016 Load-Date: January 25, 2024  End of Document
