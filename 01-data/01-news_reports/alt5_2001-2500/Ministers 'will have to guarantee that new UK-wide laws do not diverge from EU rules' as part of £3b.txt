   Ministers 'will have to guarantee that new UK-wide laws do not diverge from EU rules' as part of £3bn DUP deal to revive Northern Ireland power-sharing MailOnline January 31, 2024 Wednesday 9:27 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 1326 words Byline: David Wilcock, Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline Jason Groves, Political Editor For The Daily Mail Body   The deal will see Michelle O'Neill become Sinn Fein's first ever First Minister The DUP backed deal includes £3.3billion in funding for Northern Ireland Ministers will publish the Government's deal with the Democratic Unionist Party which sets the stage for the return of the Stormont power-sharing, amid fears it will force the whole UK to remain aligned with EU trade rules.  After tense talks that ran into the early hours of yesterday, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party was ready to back a deal that will see Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill installed as the first ever republican First Minister.  But questions have arisen over the detail of the arrangement and how it will affect Britain. The arrangement includes £3.3billion in new funding for Northern Ireland, together with promises from Government that post-Brexit trade barriers between the Province and the rest of the UK will be eased. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has already said that the agreement will remove all post-Brexit checks on goods destined for Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.  But Tory Brexiteers fear it could weaken the UK's ability to diverge from EU rules, with the so-called 'Irish sea border' for goods simply moved to include the whole of the UK. The Irish deputy premier Micheal Martin will take part in a round of talks with Northern Ireland's main political parties and business leaders in Belfast later today. Speaking ahead of the meetings, Mr Martin said the Irish Government has 'no issue' with streamlining and ensuring a seamless passage of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Speaking on Tuesday, following meetings with other Stormont parties, Sir Jeffrey said the deal would represent a 'significant change' in addressing unionist concerns over Brexit's so-called Irish Sea border. He said: 'On checks, on goods, moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and staying within the UK there will no longer by physical checks, identity checks, save where, as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity; that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom. 'On customs paperwork, customs declarations, supplementary declarations, will be gone.' Sinn Fein's national leader Mary Lou McDonald claimed the move meant the reunification of Ireland was now within 'touching distance'. The DUP walked out of Stormont in February 2022 in protest at post-Brexit trade checks blamed for driving a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The political deadlock has left Stormont paralysed. Sir Jeffrey yesterday said the new deal would mean 'zero checks, zero customs paperwork on goods moving within the United Kingdom'. He added: 'That takes away the border within the UK between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and that is something that's very important.' Downing Street declined to confirm his assessment, saying new proposals would be published following consultation with other parties in Northern Ireland. Ministers remain nervous that the fragile deal could collapse if hardline loyalists judge that the detail does not match Sir Jeffrey's rhetoric. Some members of the DUP's executive were so concerned by the plan that they attended Monday night's crunch briefing 'wired up' to enable loyalist activist Jamie Bryson to conduct a live commentary from outside on what were supposed to be private discussions. Mr Bryson said: 'If, as I suspect, the legislation is at variance with Sir Jeffrey's glossy power point presentation, then he has a very big problem.' Under the terms of the Brexit deal, Northern Ireland has full access to the EU's single market to prevent the need for a hard border with the Republic. But the arrangement has led to EU checks on certain goods entering from Great Britain, triggering unionist anger and shortages of some goods. Rishi Sunak's Windsor Framework deal last year dealt with some of the problems but was not enough to win over the DUP. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, who will publish details of the legislation today, said he now believes that 'all the conditions are now in place' for Stormont to return. The plans include a 'screening mechanism' to reassure unionists that proposals to diverge from EU laws will not create barriers to trade within the UK. Whitehall sources suggested the agreement would make only limited changes to the UK's deal with the EU. The Windsor Framework, signed by Mr Sunak last year, will not be amended.                      The women leading Sinn Fein to power in Ireland                      Sinn Fein is led by two women who may hold power north and south of the border in years to come.  Michelle O'Neill will become Northern Ireland's first republican first minister if the deal agreed by the DUP is ratified, in a momentous moment for the country.  And party president Mary Lou McDonald is in poll position to take power in Ireland in an election expected next year. SF has had the joint highest number of seats in the Dail in the 2020 election but were kept from power by a coalition of Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. McDonald's party is currently leading in the polls, though they are nine points below their peak popularity in 2020. Northern Ireland's First Minister-elect Mrs O'Neill was brought up in one of the most notorious battlegrounds of the Troubles.  And the family of the deputy leader of Sinn Fein were deeply involved in the clashes in East Tyrone. One cousin, Tony Doris, was one of three IRA men killed in an SAS ambush in 1991, when O'Neill was 14. A second, Gareth Doris, was involved in a high explosives attack on a police base in Coalisland in 1997, only a year before the Good Friday Agreement which was to bring peace was signed. He was shot by police but survived. He was sentenced to ten years in jail but, because of the GFA, he was released in less than three. Mrs O'Neill's father, too, was an IRA member. He was interned at the notorious Maze Prison at the height of the Troubles, and spent time in other jails, including Crumlin Road in Belfast, Armagh and Magilligan.  The 47-year-old was born in County Cork shortly after the height of the Troubles. She joined Sinn Fein only after the Good Friday Agreement was signed - at the time, she was 21 and married with a child - and worked for the SF MP Francie Molloy for seven years until 2005. In in 2010 she became the first woman mayor of Dungannon and South Tyrone and served as deputy First Minister under the DUP's Arlene Foster and Paul Givan from 2020.  And after the 2022 election she should have become First Minister, but for the DUP collapsing power-sharing.  And she has attempted to foster an image of moderation in the interregnum. She attracted criticism from allies and opponents when she attended both the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II and the coronation of Charles III, the later alongside Irish president Michael D Higgins. Mary Lou McDonald was born in Dublin on May 1, 1969 and is the new president of Sinn Fein. She was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, the University of Limerick and Dublin City University, studying English Literature, European Integration Studies and Human Resource management. After leaving university, the politician ran for the leadership unopposed and had served as deputy leader since February 2008. She has been a Member of Dáil Éireann, the equivalent of an MP, for Dublin Central since 2011 and had previously served as an MEP for the Dublin constituency from 2004 to 2009. McDonald was previously a member of Fianna Fáil, another Irish republican party, although quit to join Sinn Fein in 1998. She first ran for public office back in 2002, unsuccessfully contesting the Dublin West seat, winning just eight per cent of the vote. She married her husband Martin Lanigan in 1996 and has two children. Raised in the affluent Rathgar area, she she has two brothers and a sister. She has previously said that she 'completely understood and understand why people volunteered for the IRA'. Load-Date: January 31, 2024  End of Document
