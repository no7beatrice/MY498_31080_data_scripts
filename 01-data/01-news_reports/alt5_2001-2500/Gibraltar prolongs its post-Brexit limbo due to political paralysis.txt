   Gibraltar prolongs its post-Brexit limbo due to political paralysis CE Noticias Financieras English September 17, 2023 Sunday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC. All Rights Reserved Copyright 2023 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved Length: 942 words Body          At the time of the Brexit referendum, in which 96% of "yanitos" voted to remain in the EU, Gibraltar's chief minister, Fabian Picardo, described the historic divorce as an "existential threat" to The Rock. He has since retracted that statement, but the truth is that the expression quite accurately represents the profound change implied by the new framework for the Rock, whose border with Spain is the only land border - along with that of Ireland - that now links the UK to the EU bloc. Since Brexit, Gibraltar has been in limbo. And it does not seem that the situation will change in the short term, since negotiations to reach an agreement have been paralyzed by the recent elections in the Rock and the Spanish political uncertainty left by the elections of July 23. Last Tuesday, Picardo announced the dissolution of Parliament and the calling of elections for next October 12, coinciding with Columbus Day. The appointment with the polls was scheduled for the last quarter of this year and Picardo -who has governed the Rock since 2011- has not wanted to extend the calendar since, according to sources consulted, his intention is to get a renewed mandate while Spain decides who to put in La Moncloa, a situation that could be extended until early next year. The political paralysis does not benefit anyone, especially Gibraltar, where the consequences of Brexit are beginning to leave their mark on citizens with the problems that were recorded this summer with the external supply of platelets for patients in their health centers and the significant increase in the cost for ambulance services. The summer has also been marked by the tensions created after the incident between the Gibraltarian authorities and a patrol boat of the Customs Surveillance Service and the conflicts with Spanish fishing boats which have been followed by an escalation in the reproaches between the mayor of Algeciras, José Ignacio Landaluce, and Picardo. All in all, the Brexit forces Madrid and the Rock to find a pragmatic solution of coexistence. Around 30,000 people cross the fence every day. Among them, 15,000 workers, of whom 10,000 are Spaniards from an area such as Campo de Gibraltar, where unemployment rarely drops below 30%. Agreement in extremis on New Year's Eve On New Year's Eve 2020, a few hours before the end of the Brexit transition period, London and Madrid managed to reach an agreement in extremis to avoid strict border controls. The text contained the guidelines to close a treaty between the European Commission and the United Kingdom on the Rock. But it is only a temporary solution that can be rescinded at any time and that could have a different course depending on whether the PP or PSOE finally governs. If you want flexibility in the fence, the Schengen border must be outsourced to the port and airport of the Rock. But that requires the presence of agents from Spain (Schengen member). And therein lies the crux of the matter. Especially considering that the land where the airport is built was not contemplated in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713-1715). The British took it over in the 19th century, when epidemics forced the population to move to the isthmus. What has been proposed is that Frontex, the EU's Border and Coast Guard Agency - with which, incidentally, the UK signed a preliminary working arrangement just this week - will carry out the checks during a four-year transition period, after which Spanish officials will take over. But for Gibraltarians, the idea of "Spanish boots on the ground" is a deep red line, harking back to the days of the Franco regime when the border was closed in 1969, leaving many families divided. Anxiety was heightened ahead of the Spanish elections when polls gave a prominence - which later proved wrong - for Vox, whose leader, Santiago Abascal, said that anything short of sovereignty over Gibraltar would be a "betrayal". The recovery of sovereignty was also in the PP manifesto for the 23J. Waiting for white smoke In the now paralyzed negotiations there is talk of "a zone of shared prosperity", a euphemism to avoid talking about sovereignty over the British colony. But it is sovereignty, after all, that has marked the context of the last 300 years. And the issue that, ultimately, now hinders the longed-for white smoke to close a pact. Nobody wants to close a fence that would shake both the economy of the Rock and that of the surrounding Spanish regions. But, at the same time, nobody wants to sign any term, any point, any comma that could affect the sovereignty issue in an international treaty. In Brussels, there is an interest in getting the negotiations to move forward. It would be incomprehensible to have reached an agreement on Ireland earlier this year - where the situation was infinitely more complex because of the historical problems between Catholics and Protestants - and not to have reached one now on the Rock. In any case, it wants to give its place to Spain which, as a member of the bloc, after Brexit managed to get the EU to guarantee it veto power for any pact reached regarding the Rock. Also, Madrid got the EU to mention, for the first time, Gibraltar as a colony thus joining the criterion maintained by the UN since 1967. Picardo stressed last Tuesday that they were in "advanced talks with senior officials from the EU, Spain and the UK". "We are on the doorstep of a historic agreement in which all parties will win and none will lose," he said during a speech in which he repeated that "British sovereignty over the whole of Gibraltar is not for sale." "However sweet the carrot or hard the stick, my answer will always be the same," he said. Load-Date: September 18, 2023  End of Document
