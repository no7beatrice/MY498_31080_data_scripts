   I'm A Celeb's Fred Sirieix and Nigel Farage come to blows AGAIN over politics as the First Dates star explodes in a foul-mouthed rant: 'He's talking b*******!'

All Rights Reserved  Section: TV&SHOWBIZ; Version:1 Length: 476 words Byline: Geraint Llewellyn For Mailonline Body                        I'm A Celeb's Fred Sirieix and Nigel Farage bumped heads as they argued about politics yet again on Sunday. The First Dates star, 51, was left fuming and declared the former Brexit Party leader, 59, was 'talking b*******'. The duo clashed after Nigel said as they cooked: 'I wonder how many people at home have had eel risotto for breakfast. From an environmental perspective, the way we're fishing some of the oceans is not very clever.' While Tony Bellew, 41, concurred: 'We're destroying the oceans.' After politician Nigel said he spoke about the subject in parliament, Fred quipped: 'I'm sure you did'.  Nigel began 'A combination of European greed...' only for his furious campmate to interrupt him.  The French maître d' said: 'It's not just European greed, you've got to stop saying that. Because it's the world who is overfishing. You've got to stop saying European greed in all of this. This is just not right Nigel.' After continuing to argue, Fred said in the Bush Telegraph: 'He never answers the questions. But do you know why? Because he's talking b*****.' They previously clashed during a heated debate about Brexit within days of entering the camp.  Politician Nigel was the leader of the UK Independence Party from 2006 to 2009 and 2010 to 2016, and leader of the Brexit Party from 2019 to 2021, with a referendum on Brexit being held in 2016. His previous work in politics prompted questions from his fellow campmates while sat in the jungle camp during Monday's episode, with many of his fellow celebrities disagreeing with his views on the UK's exit from the European Union.  Around camp, This Morning host Josie Gibson asked Nigel what former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who worked on completing Brexit after the referendum, was like, saying: 'What's he like on a personal level?' Former EastEnders actress Danielle Harold added: 'Forget politics, as a guy.' Nigel replied: 'Entertaining... in small doses. [He's] surprisingly introverted. You see this big act, fluffing the hair... surprising.' Josie asked: 'Is he quite a fumbler in real life, or is that just on the stage?' Nigel continued: 'I think he's one of the most disorganised human beings that possibly ever lived. The whole thing's bloody chaos. Shambles.' In the Bush Telegraph, Danielle said: 'I found it so interesting to listen, sat with him picking his brains, having a chat. Then it got a little bit heated.' Fred asked Nigel: 'What's the benefit of Brexit then? If you are an average person from Britain, what's the benefit?' Nigel said: 'To know that we're independent, we stand on our own two feet in the world.' Fred said: 'Brexit was about immigration, I remember your poster. I thought it was shameful what you did Nigel. Shameful.' Nigel replied: 'Sadly, sadly it was absolutely true. It was a poster showing mass young men moving illegally across borders.'
