   Most Leavers still believe Brexit will turn out well The Times (London) June 23, 2023 Friday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 2 Length: 250 words Byline: Oliver Wright Body   A majority of voters who supported leaving the EU in 2016 still believe that Brexit will turn out to be a success in the long run, a new poll suggests. The survey, carried out for the UK in a Changing Europe think tank, found that while the majority of Leave voters were unhappy with the way Brexit had been handled by the government, their regret at leaving the EU was still low. More than 70 per cent said they would still vote Leave if another referendum were held today, compared with 16 per cent who would vote Remain. The poll of 4,000 people, carried out by Public First to coincide with the seventh anniversary of the Brexit referendum in 2016, found that while Leave voters had significant regrets about Brexit they tended to blame politicians for its failure and still hoped that the situation could improve. More than a fifth (22 per cent) believe that Brexit will turn out very well in the long run, with 39 per cent believing it will turn out well. Twelve per cent think that it will turn out badly or very badly. Less than a third of the Leave voters polled (29 per cent) believe Brexit has had a negative economic impact. Nearly half (48 per cent) said there was a way in which politicians could have made Brexit work, but that they did not even try. Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe, said: "Many Leave voters believe Brexit has not been a success because politicians have let them down. The danger is that this will lead to an erosion of faith in politics and politicians." Load-Date: June 23, 2023  End of Document
