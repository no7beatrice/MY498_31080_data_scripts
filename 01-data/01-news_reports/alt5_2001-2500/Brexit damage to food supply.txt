   Brexit damage to food supply Liverpool Echo August 19, 2023 Saturday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: SPORT; Pg. 16 Length: 287 words Body   LIZ Webster, founder and chair of Save British Farming, gave some stark facts and warnings about our food supply when she phoned James O'Brien on LBC this week. Her passion and fears were palpable. She claims we need to rejoin the EU as a matter of urgency. Brexit has resulted in farms struggling and declining because of labour shortages and the loss of EU funding. We are the third largest importers of food after China and Japan. Our food production is now falling off a cliff, making us more reliant on imports and at the mercy of world food prices. wright Researchers at the LSE's Centre for Economic Performance warned last year that Brexit had added almost £6bn to UK food bills in the two years to the end of 2021. The UK has the highest food inflation rate in the industrialised world. Although our food product exporters are having to struggle with the red tape that Brexit brought, our EU exporters aren't being subjected to the same red tape, giving them an unfair advantage. We keep delaying the checks on imports because there are concerns they would increase the cost of food imports to consumers and fuel further inflation. And, as usual, we're not ready. Who'd have thought? So no, Brexit still hasn't been "done". Liz said that Brexit has blown our food system and, unless we face reality and rejoin, we face more rampant inflation and worsening food shortages. One of the many lies of the leave campaign was "Your weekly food shop will become cheaper. Food prices will no longer be inflated by agricultural polices controlled by the EU". What a pity their lies weren't robustly challenged before the referendum, but why isn't anyone being held to account and asked to explain themselves now?
