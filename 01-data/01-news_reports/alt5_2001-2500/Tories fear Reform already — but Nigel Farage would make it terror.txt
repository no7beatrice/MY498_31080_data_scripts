   Tories fear Reform already — but Nigel Farage would make it terror thetimes.co.uk February 18, 2024 Sunday 12:01 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 1869 words Byline: Harry Yorke, Deputy Political Editor Highlight: The party can’t win many seats, it has little money and its leader has a low profile. But the Conservatives are still nervous about the Farage effect following a bruising by-election Body   It was telling that in the small hours of Friday morning, smarting from another brace of by-election defeats, Conservative MPs were not talking about Labour but Reform UK. In Wellingborough, Sir Keir Starmer overturned an 18,500 majority on the second-biggest swing from the Tories to Labour since the Second World War, confirming his party is on course to win a sizeable majority in the general election.  However, in the minds of Tory rightwingers, it is the breakthrough of Richard Tice’s populist fringe party that marks the beginning of the end of their 14 years in power. While Reform has consistently underperformed since its inception in late 2020 — it was previously known as the Brexit Party under Nigel Farage — it has finally broken through the double-digit ceiling.  In Wellingborough, a Brexit-voting seat in Northamptonshire, it chalked up 13 per cent of the vote, while in Kingswood, in Gloucestershire, it secured 10.4 per cent — bigger than Labour’s majority over the Tories. It is,  according to Farage, now honorary president of Reform , a “coming-of-age moment”, while Tice said after the results that his party had overtaken the Liberal Democrats as the “third-largest political force in the UK”. It is also why some Tory MPs are already agitating for Rishi Sunak to shift the party further to the right on immigration, welfare and fiscal policy. If replicated at a general election, the results suggest that Reform, while still struggling to win seats outright, could split the right-wing vote to such an extent that dozens of Tory seats would fall to Labour and even the Liberal Democrats. This threat is laid bare in a new analysis by the More in Common think tank, which suggests that Reform winning 10 per cent of the vote would cost the Tories 39 seats, with Labour gaining 32 and the Lib Dems five. The Tory losses would climb to 47 seats if Reform hit 12 per cent of the vote, and to 63 seats if it hit 15 per cent, with Labour and Lib Dem gains also rising. While Tice insists his party is seeking to take votes from both Sunak and Starmer, More in Common’s research suggests 59 per cent of Reform’s backers voted Tory in 2019, compared with just 5 per cent who backed Labour.  Luke Tryl, the think tank’s UK director, said: “While you can’t simply add up the Conservative and Reform vote and assume it would give a combined vote share if the two parties joined forces, we do know that for every ten votes the party gets, they take six of those from the Conservatives and just half a vote from Labour. Even though Reform won’t win seats themselves, for every ten votes the party gets Labour effectively gain 5½ over the Conservatives.” James Johnson of JL Partners, Theresa May’s former Downing Street polling expert, also believes the threat to the Tories is existential. “Double digits for a party that doesn’t really have a known leader or a meaningful brand is really impressive for them,” he said. “The by-election shows they are real. It would have been still bad for the Conservatives on the night [if Reform did not exist] but it wouldn’t have been anywhere near as bad.” In a recent report, Implosion in Blue, JL Partners found about one in five 2019 Tory voters intend to vote for Reform at the next election.  This, according to Johnson, helps explain why the Conservative vote share is lower under Sunak than it was under his predecessor, Liz Truss, despite Labour’s headline support remaining relatively unchanged. It also means Tory losses will not just be confined to the “red wall” of former Labour heartland seats that turned blue in 2019: Labour and even the Lib Dems could come through the middle to take a number of southern seats.  While  Reform clearly threatens to split the Tory vote , the first-past-the-post system means its chance of winning seats remains slim. Johnson believes its best chance is in places like Clacton-on-Sea, in Essex, the only seat ever won by a Ukip candidate in a general election, where a recent poll suggested Farage would be elected were he to stand. Tice, however, remains convinced his party can go above 15 per cent and that Reform’s best chance of doing so is to appeal to working-class voters across the country. While he accepts his voters are concentrated predominantly in the red wall and coastal communities, Tice and his team say they do not intend to draw up a list of target seats and will instead focus on those with good candidates. Farage agrees, arguing that the party’s performance this week showed it still lacked “brand awareness” and that in Kingswood it was let down by an under-resourced canvassing operation. He insists that with new sources of funding the party would “easily beat” the 3.8 million votes secured by Ukip at the height of its popularity in 2015. Matthew Goodwin, a professor of political science at the University of Kent, said the seats Reform has the best chance of winning are those “with a long history of providing strong support for the likes of Ukip, Brexit and the Brexit Party”.  Many of these seats are filled with “working-class, non-graduate, older and white voters”, he adds. Using 2021 census data at ward and constituency level, and factoring in social class, education, age and ethnicity, Goodwin has drawn up a list of the 25 most “Reform-friendly seats”, which he intends to publish on  his Substack blog  tomorrow. While he notes the party is likely to “struggle to win these seats”, it could become the “main alternative to the dominant party” in dozens of them, and could even “pull off a shock or two along the way”.  The top five, Goodwin says, are Boston and Skegness (currently Tory); Kingston upon Hull (Labour); Great Yarmouth (Tory, held by the former party chairman Sir Brandon Lewis); and two new seats created under boundary changes: Blaenau Gwent and Rhymney, and Barnsley South.  Surprisingly, Clacton, the seat Farage has been linked to, is just 22nd on the list. While many of the seats are also Tory, Goodwin says it is revealing that a considerable number are also “Labour seats, pointing to the long-term potential for a party like Reform to emerge as the main alternative across areas like the red wall”. Tice will seek to ram home the advantage at Reform’s spring conference next week in Doncaster, announcing right-wing policies in a manifesto-style document he is branding an “election contract”. The document, Tice said, is 25-30 pages long and will include pledges to scrap the remaining section of HS2, along with two other major sources of taxpayer expenditure.  While he has refused to say what they are, it is understood one will be the scrapping of the UK’s net-zero policies, with  Reform also planning to set out radical changes  to the NHS. The following week, his party hopes to make further inroads in the Rochdale by-election, where they believe their candidate, the former Labour MP Simon Danczuk, will resonate with “white working-class voters” who feel alienated by the other candidates’ focus on the Israel-Palestine conflict.  In an attempt to cauterise the wound on his right flank, Sunak is attempting to “squeeze” the Reform vote by presenting the next election as a binary choice between him and Starmer. The message — that a vote for Tice will put Starmer in No 10 — is also being filtered down to Tory MPs and disseminated in their election leaflets. One backbencher, Marco Longhi, has taken it a step further, insisting in a recent leaflet that Britain is a “two-party country” and “voting for a minority party will only split the vote and allow Labour to creep in”. Tryl argues this strategy is misconceived and underestimates the number of disillusioned voters who will not return to the Tories, with or without Reform. “While the ‘inflow’ of the Reform vote certainly hurts the Conservatives, the same isn’t true the other way,” he added.  “We know fewer than three in ten of those currently planning to vote Reform say they would go back to the Tories if there wasn’t a Reform candidate. From our focus groups, we know Reform voters are angry not just about migration but the sense of a ‘rigged system’ that benefits the rich above ordinary folk, and many want to punish the Conservatives for the performance over the past few years. That means a 2019 Brexit Party stand-down deal won’t help the Conservatives as much as some on the right of the Tories seem to think.” Johnson concurs. “The view seems to be that a general election will see the Reform vote get squeezed down,” he said. “I think it could run the other way, because the people most likely to vote for Reform are low-turnout voters, meaning people who don’t turn out for by-elections but do in generals. These are 2019 voters who backed Boris, who don’t like Starmer but could go to Reform. That feels to me like a really important thing that also applied to Ukip.” Some Tory MPs believe the antidote is to embrace Reform and shift further to the right. But Tryl warns a “hug Reform” strategy is also fraught with risk: “It’s worth noting any attempt by the Tories to steal Reform’s clothes could well lose votes at the other end to Labour and the Liberal Democrats.” Conservative Party insiders are now attempting to quell the unrest among MPs by highlighting the fact that Reform’s performance is underwhelming compared with the results achieved by Ukip in 2015.  In Wellingborough , the party’s vote share is six points below what Ukip achieved in the seat in 2015. Historical trends also suggest that third parties such as Reform do better in by-elections. In the 2014 by-election in Newark, a similarly “safe” Tory seat, Ukip secured 26 per cent of the vote; a year later at the general election this had more than halved to 12 per cent.  “If there is one bright spot for the Conservatives it is that despite the hype, Reform’s performance was actually at the bottom end of what we might expect if they really are set to get over 10 per cent in a general election,” Tryl added. “This performance was more consistent with an eventual Reform vote of 6-8 per cent — still enough to cost the Tories in the region of 30 seats but not as many as might be assumed on the current polling.” That equation could change dramatically, however,  should Farage re-enter the fray . He insisted it remained “very much up in the air what I’m going to do”, while a close ally said he was disappointed that Reform’s results were not closer to those achieved by Ukip previously. “I know he wanted a few more points,” they added. Others remain convinced he will return, and that Reform’s vote share will surge accordingly. “I think the results have pushed the dial towards Nigel’s re-engagement quite significantly,” a senior Reform figure said.  “I think that if Farage was leader, the by-election results for Reform would have been double, maybe even more,” Johnson added. “Farage is a known entity and he speaks to a lot of these voters who are dissatisfied and don’t want to go to Labour. Farage is also at his best-ever reputation because of the jungle [his appearance in ITV’s                     I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!                    , where he came third]. You do focus groups and people say he is plain-speaking. They knew that before the jungle but didn’t think he was relatable. Now they do.” Load-Date: February 17, 2024  End of Document
