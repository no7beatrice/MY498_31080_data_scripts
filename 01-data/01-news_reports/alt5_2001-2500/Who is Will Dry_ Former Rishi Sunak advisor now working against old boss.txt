   Who is Will Dry? Former Rishi Sunak advisor now working against old boss standard.co.uk January 25, 2024 Thursday 12:33 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS,NEWS; Version:2 Length: 763 words Byline: Tamara Davison Highlight: Will Dry has turned on his former boss, predicting the Conservatives are on track for the 'most almighty of defeats' in the next election Body   Will Dry, Rishi Sunak 's former advisor , has joined a growing chorus of people who want the Prime Minister replaced.  The 26-year-old special adviser, who quit last year over the direction of the Conservative Party, has teamed up with a group of advisers and MPs  that aretrying to oust Sunak. In a lengthy statement shared on social media by the Sun's political editor, Dry claimed that he had grown "dispirited" with the party last year and foresees it heading towards an "almighty defeat" at the next election.  "Everyone in the country can see just how colossal the challenges we face are. Sadly, it became clear to me we weren’t providing the bold, decisive action to overcome those challenges," the statement read.  He also maintained that he never planned to speak publicly about his recent work to "alert the Conservative Party to the danger the country and it is in". However, Dry claims in the statement that, hours after telling No10, he was bombarded with press inquiries.  "Conservative MPs decide who leads the Conservative Party , not unelected advisors like me," he continued. "And it looks like they may not want to change leader. But this is a big decision they owe it to the country's future to reflect on."  Dry's statement came just one day after former Cabinet minister Simon Clarke called for Mr Sunak to be replaced , branding his leadership "uninspiring". Both Dry and Clarke have warned that Sunak's leadership will prove detrimental in the upcoming election.  Sunak had earlier also survived a major rebellion  that saw 60 Conservative MPs threaten to vote against his flagship Rwanda Bill  at its third reading. This all signals growing discontent among the Tory ranks about the party's general direction.                       Who is Will Dry?                     Will Dry co-founded Our Future Our Choice (OFOC), a pro-EU advocacy group he created with Femi Oluwole.   Painted as a youth advocacy group, OFOC was pushing for a second referendum to overturn the Brexit result ultimately. The group is also known to have protested outside Chequers about Brexit.  According to the MailOnline , Dry was actually a Leave supporter but quickly regretted his decision.  Dry went on to pen several articles, where he took aim at Brexit. "We have grown conditioned to the daily dose of bad news that Brexit brings. This must change," he wrote for the New European in 2018 , when he was a second-year student at Oxford University.  Despite Rishi Sunak being a staunch Brexit supporter, the new PM then appointed him as a special adviser (SpAd) in November 2022, just after Liz Truss was ousted. SpAds are seen as temporary civil servants tasked with advising the Government on various topics.  Dry remained in the role for around a year before he became seemingly discontent with what he witnessed and pivoted towards his latest endeavour.  He has since aligned himself with the Conservative Britain Alliance (CBA) group, a shadowy organisation that seems committed to ousting Sunak.                      What did Will Dry say about Rishi Sunak?                     Working among Sunak's inner circle for less than a year appeared enough for Dry to ascertain that the party was in trouble.                       Be in no doubt: we are on course for at least a decade of Labour rule. And, if Farage comes back, the Conservative Party essentially won't exist by Christmas                    Will Dry His statement paints a dismal picture of what lies ahead for the Conservative Party, including spectacular losses at the election due to a current lack of leadership, and even the end of the party as we know it.  “You cannot dent them without internalising how just how fundamentally broken our political system is," Dry's statement said.  According to The Sun's political editor, Dry resigned "amid rows over the direction of government".                       What is the Conservative British Alliance?                     Little is actually known about the CBA group that Dry has been working with, but it seems to be backing some pretty damning projects that go against the Government's agenda.  CBA has been described in the past as a “group of Conservative donors", but the anonymous group hasn't publicly identified any members.  Reports have since revealed that Dry was recently involved with polling that predicted a landslide Labour victory.  The poll, spearheaded by Lord David Frost, is said to have cost around £70,000, that the CBA allegedly funded.  Other reports have claimed CBA could be working with up to 10 Tory MPs, that includes some rather prominent political figures.  Load-Date: January 25, 2024  End of Document
