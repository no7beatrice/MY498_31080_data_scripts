   Labour leader pledges to renegotiate Brexit deal by 2025 CE Noticias Financieras English September 18, 2023 Monday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC. All Rights Reserved Copyright 2023 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved Length: 818 words Body            Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour Party and favorite to be the next British Prime Minister, promises that if he becomes the Government he will renegotiate the agreement for the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU. In 2025, as agreed with the European Commission, it is time to review the trade and cooperation pact between the country and the bloc, although the appointment does not foresee reopening the Brexit.          Labour has so far preferred to avoid the Brexit debate that has divided the parties, but Starmer dares to suggest it given the regret of a part of those who voted to leave, the isolation of the country and the economic suffering greater than that of the neighbors. Fifty-six percent of citizens believe that leaving the EU was "the wrong decision" versus 32% who still say it was the right one (the rest don't know), according to the latest polls this August.          In June 2016, 52% of Britons voted in a referendum in favor of Brexit. But now the total break-up that Boris Johnson's government chose to implement is particularly unpopular and means that tomatoes are missing from the shelves of British supermarkets, there are long queues to cross the English Channel with train tickets skyrocketing in price, restaurants have to serve fewer meals due to a lack of workers, companies sell less outside the country and households are poorer.       A "meager" agreement          "Virtually everyone recognizes that the deal Johnson made is too meager," Starmer now says in an interview in the Financial Times during a summit of progressive leaders in Montreal, in Canada. "Looking to 2025, we will try to get a much better deal out of it for the U.K."          By then, Starmer is expected to be the new British prime minister. In polls of voting intentions for the general election, which must be held by January 2025 at the latest, Labour is almost 20 points ahead of the Conservatives.          In principle, what is planned in 2025 in Brussels are meetings to assess how the implementation of the trade and cooperation agreement, which started to be implemented in 2021, has gone.          "We have to make it work. It's not about going back in. But I refuse to accept that we can't make it work. I'm thinking of future generations when I say that," said Starmer, who cited his teenage children as part of the generation hurt by the decision to leave the EU in a referendum where there was a marked age gap (most of those under 45 voted to remain).          The Labour leader visited the Netherlands last week and discussed cooperation with the EU on immigration. This Tuesday he travels to Paris to meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and hopes to insist on his message of rapprochement with the Union.      The long road back          The revision of the agreement could start a broader process, but some expert voices doubt that in the short term the EU is keen to go beyond improving a few details in various agreements.          "Essentially it's a review to sit down and debate whether what we have is working. So it's not a way to sit down and renegotiate the whole thing," Anand Menon, professor of European politics and international relations at King's College London and director of UK in a Changing Europe, a network of academics specializing in EU relations, explained to elDiario.es in June. Menon, like other experts, believes that in his country "it will be a long time before there is a serious political conversation about rejoining."          But even the Conservatives have already backtracked on several decisions that took the U.K. away from the EU. The new agreement on Northern Ireland effectively means that this British territory will remain in the EU single market, the UK has just returned to the pan-European Horizon research program, has decided not to automatically erase all laws derived from EU law as the most pro-Brexit supporters in Parliament had tried to do, and will indefinitely accept EU "CE" labeling on products it intended to remove and replace with an indigenous one. In fact, Rishi Sunak himself, a supporter of Brexit from the beginning, has been trying for months to get closer to the EU, even if in a discreet way so as not to revolt the most advocates of the total rupture in his party.          Businessmen and economic authorities complain about the exit agreement agreed by the Conservatives. Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, accuses Tory politicians of having made promises based on fantasy. This Sunday, in Montreal, he criticized the "extreme Conservatives" for "not understanding the basics of how economies work", and for insisting on lowering taxes as a solution to the crisis, just as the short-lived Prime Minister Liz Truss did last fall.          "When Brexit supporters tried to create Singapore on the Thames, the Truss government brought Argentina into the channel," Carney said.       Load-Date: September 19, 2023  End of Document
