   ITV I'm A Celebrity's Fred Sirieix slams 'shameful' Nigel Farage in explosive jungle clash mirror.co.uk November 20, 2023 Monday 9:24 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: TV NEWS; Version:4 Length: 949 words Byline: By, Mark Jefferies at the I'm A Celeb camp & Charlotte Tutton Highlight: I'm A Celebrity 2023 star Fred Sirieix wasted no time in calling out his campmate Nigel Farage over Brexit, leading to the pair getting into a heated disagreement that left their co-stars feeling unsure where to look Body    First Dates star Fred Sirieix started a rumble in the I'm A Celebrity jungle as he attacked Nigel Farage over his Brexit campaign and branded it "shameful".  The 51-year-old Frenchman was with the failed politician for less than 48 hours in camp before he questioned his tactics and motivation for wanting the UK to leave Europe in 2016. Fred said the average person had "lost out" now we were no longer part of the EU, but Farage insisted "they haven't lost out" despite multiple problems for the country since it left.  The conversation started calmly with Josie Gibson and Danielle Harold asking Farage what ex Prime Minister Boris Johnson was really like. He replied: "Entertaining... in small doses. [He's] surprisingly introverted. You see this big act, fluffing the hair... surprising.  "I think he's one of the most disorganised human beings that possibly ever lived. The whole thing's bloody chaos. Shambles." In the Bush Telegraph Danielle said: "I found it so interesting to listen, sat with him picking his brains, having a chat. Then it got a little bit heated." Fred asked Farage: "What's the benefit of Brexit then If you are an average person from Britain, what's the benefit" Farage said: "To know that we're independent, we stand on our own two feet in the world." Fred said back: "Brexit was about immigration, I remember your poster. I thought it was shameful what you did Nigel. Shameful." Farage replied: "Sadly, sadly it was absolutely true. It was a poster showing mass young men moving illegally across borders." Fred then said: "But it was about demonising migrants." Farage replied: "No it wasn't. In your view it was, but it wasn't." To which Fred said: "It's not only just my view." UKIP's controversial "breaking point" anti-EU poster in 2016 showed a long queue of migrants. A number of politicians attacked the 2016 poster, featuring a photo taken in Slovenia, with George Osborne saying at the time it had "echoes" of 1930s' literature and was "disgusting and vile". In the Bush Telegraph Farage said: "I knew it wouldn't take long, I knew politics would rear its head as indeed it did. And Fred feels very strongly about it." During the conversation, Farage also said: "Brexit is about one thing and one thing only; being self-governing.  "We're in charge. We can get it right, we can make an absolute mess of it but we're in charge and the people who make those decisions we can hire and fire at elections where they have real power." Fred said: "I think the average person in the UK has lost out because of what you've done." Farage said: "They haven't lost out."  In the Bush Telegraph Fred said afterwards: "Look, Nigel Farage is in the jungle with me. We're bound to have this conversation. At the end of the day nothing is going to change, Nigel believes what he believes, I believe what I believe. It was only a matter of time."  One person who didn't join in with the conversation was Grace Dent. The food critic was not interested in discussing Brexit with Farage and went to do the washing up.  In the Bush Telegraph she explained: "I would 100% rather wash up than listen to another single word about Brexit. I was just like, 'Oh my god, I'm going to go and put my head in that stream.'" Farage was also shown flashing his bum in the episode as Josie spotted him mooning whilst taking a shower. Josie said: "Freaking hell! I wasn't expecting to see Nigel Farage's bottom so soon! But, I've seen worse. No, I haven't. I haven't! Fair play to him. He's not shy, he just gets on in there. At least he's clean." After the scenes aired on Monday night regarding Fred and Farage's Brexit clash, viewers had one winner in mind for the ITV series. Viewers raced to X, formerly Twitter, to share their thoughts -with many calling for Fred to be this year's winner -thrilled with him calling out Farage as others fled. One viewer said: "Fred attacking Nigel about politics, is one of the best moments I've seen on reality tv this year. He spoke for the people. Fred to win x." Another commented: "okay Fred to win he is the people's prince," as a third said: "Fred to win." A fourth fan wrote: "Fred not hiding his distaste for Farage, my winner," while a fifth said: "When I saw Fred's name on that line up I knew he was a winner in my eyes. Crown that King!" Meanwhile, it seems the show faced a loss in ratings after the launch episode, amid viewers boycotting the series over the inclusion of Farage on the line-up. The opening night's ratings dropped by millions compared to the 2022 ITV series it's been revealed, after Farage reportedly joined the line-up for a staggering £1.5million. The first show of 2023 pulled in a peak audience of 7.8million and an average of 7million, down around 2million on the same show on ITV last year.  It comes as thousands of fans decided to boycott watching the year because of the inclusion of Brexit campaigner Farage. They made their feelings clear on social media where #BoycottImACeleb was trending on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday night.                      I'm A Celebrity 2023 airs every night at 9pm on ITV1 and ITVX.
