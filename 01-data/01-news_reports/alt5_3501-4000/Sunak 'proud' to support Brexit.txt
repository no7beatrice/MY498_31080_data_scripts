All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 10 Length: 150 words Byline: CHRIS DORRELL Body   RISHI SUNAK said he is "ultimately responsible" for the party's poor performance in the polls as he seeks to turn around a 20-point deficit with just under three weeks until polling day. In an interview with The Times, Sunak denied that the Conservatives were suffering because of the fallout from Liz Truss's disastrous minibudget. "I'm ultimately responsible for what I'm doing and no one else is. It rests on my shoulders," he said. The Prime Minister also defended his record on Brexit, suggesting that the UK had made good use of its 'Brexit freedoms'. "I was proud to support Brexit and it was the right decision for our country because we can take advantage of the opportunities that are now ahead of us. We're signing free-trade deals around the world, which have now led to Brexit Britain overtaking France, the Netherlands and Japan, to become the fourth largest exporter in the world," he said.
