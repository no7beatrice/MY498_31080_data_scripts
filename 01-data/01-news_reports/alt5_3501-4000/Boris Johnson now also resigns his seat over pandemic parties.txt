   Boris Johnson now also resigns his seat over pandemic parties CE Noticias Financieras English June 9, 2023 Friday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

According to him, the committee's findings, which are not yet public, indicate that he would be "kicked out" of the House of Commons.          Johnson resigned as prime minister in July last year, but remained a Conservative Party MP. He had been reluctant to leave the seat, but the revelation that police are now investigating more events that may have skirted his own government's rules a few weeks ago had put more pressure on him.          In his defiant farewell letter, Johnson claims he did not lie in the House of Commons, lashes out at his own party for not supporting him and defends Brexit, which most Britons now regret because of the effects for the economy, health and everyday life. Only 9% of Britons now say the Brexit has been a success, according to the latest YouGov poll published a few days ago. Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit party, also believes "it has been a failure," he told the BBC in an interview in May.          According to him, the parliamentary committee was against him despite the fact that it also included Conservative MPs and respected the usual procedures of these usual investigations in the UK.          "The objective from the beginning has been to say I was guilty, ignoring the facts. This is the definition of a travesty of justice," he writes in his resignation letter. Using a common expression of former President Donald Trump, Johnson assured that he is the victim of "a witch hunt", in this case, "to take revenge for Brexit and ultimately turn the 2016 referendum result on its head."          Although Johnson stressed Friday that he is leaving the seat "for now," this may be the end of the political career of the former prime minister, who had been an MP since 2001. After a landslide victory in the 2019 election, he is now unpopular among his own voters and among his group colleagues, who have not followed him in the latest challenges against the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, on negotiations with the EU to alleviate the effects of Brexit.          The parliamentary committee on Thursday handed him the report it expected to present with its allegations at the end of June and recommend a suspension that if it was longer than 10 days could force Johnson to leave his seat. The plenary would have had to vote on any sanction.          A special election will now be called for Johnson's seat, in a constituency outside London, which could be won by Labour.
