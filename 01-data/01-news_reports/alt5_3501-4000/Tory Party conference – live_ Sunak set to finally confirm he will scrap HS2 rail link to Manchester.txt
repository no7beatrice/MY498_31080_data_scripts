   Tory Party conference – live: Sunak set to finally confirm he will scrap HS2 rail link to Manchester The Independent (United Kingdom) October 3, 2023 Tuesday 5:05 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: UK POLITICS,UK; Version:36 Length: 5061 words Byline: Maryam Zakir-Hussain,Andy Gregory and Matt Mathers Highlight: He will also use his speech to attack the last 30 years of “broken politics” Body   Rishi Sunak is expected to finally confirm he will scrap the HS2 rail link to Manchester  as the prime minister gives his first party conference speech as Tory leader on Wednesday. Weeks afterThe Independent revealed he wanted to axe the northern leg of the line , Mr Sunak is set to confirm it as part of a speech in which he will also attack the last 30 years of “broken politics”.  He will argue he is the political leader to take the tough decisions necessary for the good of the country, while also accusing Labour  of wanting “power for the sake of power” and being “everything that is wrong with our politics”. But it is HS2 which is bound to steal the headlines.  The row over the high-speed line has overshadowed much of the conference after Mr Sunak repeatedly refused to clarify its future. He is expected to announce the northern leg will be ditched -but commit to building HS2 to Euston, rather than allowing it to terminate in the west London area of Old Oak Common. It comes after his ministers vowed to ship prisoners overseas  and warned voters over a ‘migrant hurricane’.                      Key Points                                                                Sunak poised to make ‘incredible gaffe’ by axing HS2                       Suella Braverman: ‘Racism smear won’t work against me’                       Nigel Farage reacts after Rishi Sunak leaves door open for his return to Tory party                       Gove boasts about ‘Conservative record’ as he claims ‘Brexit has been delivered'                       PM says people don’t care ‘how much money I have'                                                              Sunak set to use speech today to confirm HS2 scrapping-part two                    Labour’s shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh this morning pointed to the government’s own documents, which say: “Parliament has already approved plans for building HS2 Phases One and 2a, bringing a new high speed line from London to Crewe. “Once completed, these sections of HS2 will reduce Manchester-London journey times to 91 minutes from typically 126 minutes today, based on the indicative trains service. “However, the 200 metre HS2 trains that can operate in Phase 2a will not provide more capacity into Manchester compared with the current Pendolino fleet, and there is no capacity for additional trains into the city. “Only when a new line and new platforms at Manchester Piccadilly are built can more services including both [Northern Powerhouse Rail] and 400m HS2 services be accommodated. “Journey times between Birmingham and Manchester are currently poor compared with speeds to the capital. No improvement is possible without additional track capacity into Manchester, given the need to serve intermediate towns as well.” Ms Haigh added: “The Conservatives literally rubbished this idea in their own rail plan. And Greater Manchester warned it could actually make things worse by increasing delays on the West Coast Mainline. “Only the Conservatives could draw up a plan that could actually make northern transport worse than before.”                      Sunak set to use speech today to confirm HS2 scrapping-part one                    Rishi Sunak looks set to use his big Tory conference speech today to confirm what The Independent revealed last month – and scrap phase 2 of HS2, running into Manchester.  As reported yesterday, the London section from Old Oak Common to Euston appears to have had a stay of execution and will be built.  Whatever the merits of building to Euston, the prime minister is likely to face a backlash and accusations that he is again prioritising the capital at the expense of the north of England – despite a manifesto pledge to level-up.  Overnight, government sources went into spin mode and briefed some journalists that high-speed trains would still run from London to Manchester – but move onto existing lines past Birmingham.  But this had always been the temporary plan for services after the construction of phase 1, while phase 2 was being completed.                       Suella Braverman’s rhetoric is ‘certainly no Enoch Powell situation’-Shapps                    Home secretary Suella Braverman’s rhetoric is “certainly no Enoch Powell situation”, her Cabinet colleague Grant Shapps said as he defended her claim that a “hurricane” of mass migration is coming.  The Defence Secretary told Times Radio: “She makes the absolutely correct point we’ve already seen a lot of movement... we could see a lot more, a hurricane, as she describes it, of people moving.” Asked about comparisons which have been made to Enoch Powell’s infamous “rivers of blood” speech, he said: “So many people are from immigrant backgrounds in this country. I think I’m third generation myself... Suella’s first generation, her parents came over in the 60s.  “So this is certainly no Enoch Powell situation, is it, to make the very obvious point.”                      Defence secretary supports PM’s decision to scrap HS2 northern link                    Grant Shapps said he supports the prime minister in his decision to scrap the northern link of HS2, blaming travel patterns changing post-Covid.  The defence secretary and former transport secretary said: “You can plough on, you can pretend the world is as it was. Or you can take the difficult longer term decisions to go, ‘Actually, if there was a change, what could we be using that money for?’”                      Grant Shapps suggests more ‘worthwhile’ ways of spending money than on HS2 northern leg                    Defence secretary Grant Shapps suggested there may be more “worthwhile” ways of spending money than on completing the Manchester to Birmingham leg of HS2. Speaking to GB News, he said there had been a “change in travel patterns” since the pandemic and suggested there could be “fantastic levelling opportunity” from diverting funding to other projects. Asked whether ministers were turning their back on levelling up by scrapping part of the planned rail line, Mr Shapps said: “It absolutely is not turning our back at all. “In fact, of course, we need to wait for the Prime Minister’s speech. If he were to scrap the second leg of HS2... and take that money, you can’t really judge it without finding out where that money is going to be spent because that could actually have a fantastic levelling up opportunity. “Billions of pounds, tens of billions of pounds, so what could that be spent on? “And perhaps there are things which are worthwhile doing more than building a high-speed rail line given Covid, given what’s happened, given the change in travel patterns.”                      ICYMI: Trans women to be banned from female NHS wards, as Steve Barclay insists ‘Tories know what a woman is’                    Transgender women are to be banned from female NHS wards, as health secretary Steve Barclay  insisted that the Tories “know what a woman is”. The health secretary  promised in his conference speech  to restore “common sense ” to the health service  and recognise “the importance of biological sex in healthcare”.

The prime minister is expected to finally announce that the Birmingham to Manchester leg of the high-speed rail project will be ditched on Wednesday – weeks after The Independent revealed he wanted to axe it.

But he added that if it was cancelled he would “put it to (Mr Sunak) that he is actually turning his back on one of the best opportunities for levelling up and critically we are turning our back on all of those investors who have invested in the Midlands and the North on the promise of this railway coming”.
