   SECRETS SAFE Brexit hasn’t negatively impacted how the UK shares intelligence with other countries thesun.co.uk December 5, 2023 Tuesday 11:53 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS,POLITICS,BREXIT,EUROPEAN UNION,THE SUN NEWSPAPER; Version:1 Length: 189 words Byline: Martina Bet Highlight: There were major concerns when Britain left the EU Body   BREXIT has not had a negative impact on how the UK shares secret spy information with other countries, a parliamentary watchdog has said. In a new report, the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) said spy chiefs from MI5  and other agencies told them everything is pretty much the same as before Britain  cut ties with Brussels.  This is despite several initial concerns Brexit  could lead to reduced cooperation and weakened security ties with European nations.  Former US President Barack Obama  was among top figures warning ahead of the 2016 referendum that intelligence-sharing and counterterrorism would be “far more effective” if the UK remained in the EU. The committee, made up of senior MPs and peers, said in the report: “Overall, the committee is reassured that Brexit has not had a negative impact on intelligence co-operation between the UK and EU member states.” The panel recognised, though, the lack of impact is largely down to the fact intelligence activities with European counterparts has always taken place outside EU structures, and that national security tends to be unaffected by disagreements on other matters.
