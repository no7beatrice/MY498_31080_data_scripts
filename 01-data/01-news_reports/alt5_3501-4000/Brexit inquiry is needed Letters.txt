   Brexit inquiry is needed; Letters East Anglian Daily Times November 21, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 30 Length: 163 words Body   I HAVE to agree with B Walker (letters, November 4) that a Brexit Inquiry should follow the Covid Inquiry. The Covid Inquiry has revealed much that we didn't know about how the Government handled the health emergency and a truly appalling story has been exposed by the investigation. Once more, there is likely to be a lot more to follow as some of the leading 'players' have yet to appear. Of course exactly the same cast of 'players' were involved in the Brexit chaos. Another link between health and Brexit has been revealed in a news story which informed us that Brexit has helped both to create severe shortages of medication and to increase the costs of that medication. Given the conduct of government during Covid, it's highly likely that a very similar story would be exposed by an inquiry into its conduct during the Brexit process and the run up to the referendum. Let's hear what really led to Brexit and how we came to be in this 'oven ready' mess. JOHN DELL, Shotley. Load-Date: November 21, 2023  End of Document
