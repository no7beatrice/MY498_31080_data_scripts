   Boris Johnson – latest: Ex-PM’s allies named and shamed for ‘disturbing’ attacks in fresh Partygate report The Independent (United Kingdom) June 30, 2023 Friday 9:17 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: UK POLITICS,UK; Version:1 Length: 11244 words Byline: Andy Gregory,Matt Mathers and Namita Singh Highlight: New Partygate report accuses Nadine Dorries, Jacob Rees-Mogg and others of potential contempt of parliament Body   Boris Johnson ’s allies have been accused of undermining democracy with a “coordinated campaign of interference” which put “unprecedented” pressure on the committee investigating whether the ex-PM lied to parliament over Partygate.  The priviliges committee has published its new special report highlighting “disturbing” comments by Tory MPs who criticised the cross-party MPs during their 14-month inquiry. With Johnson allies having described the probe as a “witch hunt” and “kangaroo court”, those named include Nadine Dorries , Jacob Rees-Mogg , Andrea Jenkyns and Priti Patel. MPs now appear set to vote on whether to sanction them. In its damning report earlier this month, the committee found that Mr Johnson lied to parliament over Partygate and recommended a 90-day suspension.

This is an ancient right of parliament. The privileges committee is degrading the rights of parliamentarians which is incredibly dangerous. This is not North Korea.”One anoymous MP was quoted as describing the committee as “clowns”, while another told the paper: “The committee has maligned elected MPs for doing nothing more than upholding the great British tradition of freedom of expression.”Watch: Suella Braverman says she ‘respectfully disagrees’ with Rwanda rulingThursday 29 June 2023 15:27 , Andy GregoryAngela Rayner criticises ‘disgusting’ treatment of privileges committeeThursday 29 June 2023 15:19 , Andy Gregory Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner has described the behaviour of MPs highlighted in the privileges committee report as “disgusting” and “clear intimidation”, as she and Keir Starmer visited Selby.“MPs – cross-party MPs, these are not one particular party – they’re doing a job on behalf of Parliament and to try and undermine it in that way is disgusting behaviour,” Ms Rayner said.“Rishi Sunak is still not addressing that behaviour. We’ve seen the behaviour and the conduct, even ministers involved in this, that has fell below the ministerial code, that has fell below the standards that Parliament would expect, and yet Rishi Sunak promised a fresh start and we’ve not had that.“We’ve had this constant merry-go-round. Every day there’s new material of their conduct and it undermines Parliament.“Labour have set out our ethics and integrity committee. We’ve said that we’d take action and it’s about time that the prime minister did what he promised the people of this country, and he cleans up his party.“As we’ve seen here in Selby, Conservative MPs don’t seem to think any more that it’s a public duty to be an MP. They see it as their private endeavours to get what they can as an individual.”New Partygate report shows Tories ‘incapable of governing’, says StarmerThursday 29 June 2023 14:55 , Andy Gregory Sir Keir Starmer has said the privileges committee’s Partygate report was “further evidence of a divided party that is incapable of governing”.Speaking during a visit to Selby, Sir Keir told the PA news agency: “Rishi Sunak is simply too weak to deal with his MPs and you’ve got yet another story about misbehaviour by Tory MPs, and at the same time we’re in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.“So, at the moment you want the government to step it up, it’s sitting it out, arguing about the behaviour of their own MPs, and this is one of the main causes of the fact that we’re in this economic chaos now, and it’s families that are paying the price.”Starmer and Rayner say hello to Tory activistsThursday 29 June 2023 14:39 , Adam Forrest Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner were greeted at Selby train station by Tory party activists as they campaign in the Selby and Ainsty byelections.

He said he supported and respected, not just the work of the committee, which he believed to have done a thorough job, but also the decision of the House,” his official spokesperson said.He said that Downing Street had been clear about the need to avoid “traducing” the committee.Asked if the PM agreed with the objections of some Boris Johnson allies that it is a free speech issue, the spokesperson said: “It will be for the House to come to a view on Monday. We have facilitated the time for that debate, but you have heard the prime minister talk about his respect for the committee.”Sunak backs Goldsmith as No 10 declines to say if he will vote on report’s findingsThursday 29 June 2023 13:07 , Andy Gregory Rishi Sunak has confidence in Lord Goldsmith, Downing Street has said, after the government minister was named in the Privileges Committee report.The PM’s official spokesperson also declined to say whether Mr Sunak would vote in the Commons to back the report, which criticised and named several MPs and peers for putting pressure on the committee's inquiry.The spokesperson said that he would not get into the PM’s movements in advance.Declining to criticise Mr Goldsmith over his remarks, the spokesperson pointed to the Commons debate scheduled for next month, saying: “That's when individuals will be able to give their view.”Mr Sunak was absent from the debate and vote earlier this month in which all but seven MPs voted to censure Boris Johnson in line with the privileges committee’s recommendations.Nicola Sturgeon rebuked for using Covid inquiry to criticise Brexit: ‘It’s a witness box not a soap box’Thursday 29 June 2023 12:51 , Andy Gregory In addition to the arrival of the the privileges committee’s report, it is a busy day in UK politics, with the Court of Appeal’s rejection of the government’s Rwanda asylum deal and Scotland’s former first minister Nicola Sturgeon appearing before the Covid inquiry.Our political correspondentAdam Forrestreports that the former SNP leader was told off at the Covid inquiry for getting on her “soap box”, after claiming that “every aspect” of Britain’s exit from the EU “has been a false economy”.Nicola Sturgeon told off for ‘soap box’ attack on Brexit at Covid inquiry ‘Astounding’ criticism of Goldsmith unlike any in 44 years at parliament, peer saysThursday 29 June 2023 12:35 , PA Questions have been raised in parliament over whether Lord Goldsmith of Richmond Park can continue as a minister following criticism of his conduct by the privileges committee.The Tory frontbencher had been due to present two statutory instruments to the upper chamber on Thursday, but instead this was carried out on his behalf by government whip Lord Davies of Gower.Lord Goldsmith is minister for overseas territories, Commonwealth, energy, climate and environment at the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).Raising the report’s findings in the Lords, Labour former minister Lord Foulkes of Cumnock said: “Lord Goldsmith is one of the subjects of this report produced by the Privileges Committee. It is an extraordinary report the like of which I have never seen before.“Lord Goldsmith, a minister of the House of Lords, is severely criticised by the privileges committee for interfering in the procedures of the House of Commons. In my 44 years in Parliament I have never known such a criticism. It is astounding. What is happening to Lord Goldsmith? Is he able to, in the light of this criticism, to continue as a minister of the Government?”Lord Davies noted the peer’s comments.Inclusion of Zac Goldsmith leaves ‘big questions’ for governmentThursday 29 June 2023 12:18 , Andy Gregory Here is some of the immediate reaction by journalists to the priviliges committee’s special report:The BBC’s Nick Eardley says the inclusion of serving minister Zac Goldsmith leaves “big questions” for the government:Big question for Govt about a minister being seen to undermine parliamentary committeeSeveral prominent Johnson backers too; Nadine Dorries, Priti Patel, Michael Fabricant, Jacob Rees Mogg, Andrea Jenkyns https://t.co/yejMGCgm55 — Nick Eardley (@nickeardleybbc) June 29, 2023 Mikey Smith of the Daily Mirror suggests some are deliberately misinterpreting the report’s conclusions:Lotsa people going to spend today pretending they don’t understand the difference between criticising a committee and it’s decisions and impugning the character and integrity of its members.— Mikey Smith (@mikeysmith) June 29, 2023 Peter Walker of The Guardian is bracing for a discussion around “free speech”: This isn’t to prejudge whether or not those complaining about the special report have a case or not.

Actions have consequences, suck it up,” wrote the Labour MP.If any of them had even a grain of intelligence they would just apologise and likelihood is that would be the end of it.

And I think the committee had a difficult enough job to do without having that sort of criticism levelled. “I accept that the report today and the defence the committee’s made of themselves and the whole furore about parliamentary process effectively and our conduct pales into insignificance compared to the pressures people are under with their bills, with their mortgages, with the state of the NHS, and I know there is a bit of a danger of people going, ‘bloody MPs talking about themelves again’. “But I think it is important that the privileges committee is able to hold us all to account ... and to do it without fear or favour.”Sunak urged to ‘condemn’ those named in reportThursday 29 June 2023 11:17 , Andy GregoryOur political correspondentArchie Mitchellreports:Labour has accused Rishi Sunak of standing by while “senior members of his party undermine and attack” democracy.As calls mounted for Lord Goldsmith to be sacked, Labour said his position as a minister “is an example of Mr Sunak’s weakness”.Shadow leader of the House of Commons Thangam Debbonaire said: “Rishi Sunak has allowed senior members of his own party to undermine and attack Britain’s democratic institutions. This includes a serving government minister and two former Cabinet ministers.“While Rishi Sunak focuses on keeping the Boris Johnson sycophants in his own party happy, people up and down the country are left facing the cost of the Tory mortgage penalty and soaring rents. Keir Starmer will restore trust in politics, show leadership on the issues that matter to working people and act immediately to bring down the cost of living.”Ms Debbonaire called for Mr Sunak to “condemn” those named in the report, and to “make time to allow MPs to approve it in full”.Sunak must sack Goldsmith, say Lib DemsThursday 29 June 2023 11:12 , Adam Forrest The Lib Dems said Rishi Sunak should now sack Lord Goldsmith – who remains minister for Commonwealth, energy and the environment at the Foreign Office – “if he wants to show any shred of integrity”.The party’s Lords leader Lord Newby said: “This report was already damning enough but to now see a serving government minister named as interfering with the report’s findings is truly shocking.” He said the Tories were “wrapped up in dealing with sleaze and chaos”.'I’m actually going to church’: Rees-Mogg bats away reporter’s questionsThursday 29 June 2023 10:57 , Andy Gregory Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg dodged questions from journalists after being named in the Privileges Committee report.In footage aired on Sky News, he declined to comment on the criticism contained in the report.He said: “I’m actually going to church, because it is the feast of St Peter and St Paul and a holy day of obligation and I would encourage you all to do the same.

He refused to block Boris Johnson’s honours list, failed to vote for the Partygate report and his promise of integrity has been left in tatters.“The least he can do now is order an investigation into whether any collusion took place between Johnson and these MPs, and commit to revoking their honours if it did.”New Partygate report a headache for SunakThursday 29 June 2023 10:15 , Andy GregoryOur political correspondentAdam Forrestreports:The new report causes further problems for Rishi Sunak, as the committee made clear that his ministers cannot sit on their hands – urging the government to table a motion backing the committee’s latest conclusions.Saying its work was “crucial to our democracy”, the panel recommended that MPs agree a resolution approving the report, one which would make clear that parliamentarians “should not impugn the integrity” of the committee.Tory MP ‘shocked and disappointed’ to be named in reportThursday 29 June 2023 09:52 , Archie Mitchell Tory MP Brendan Clarke-Smith said he was “shocked and disappointed” to be named in the Privileges Committee’s report.The Boris Johnson supporter said he had “fully respected the processes” and claimed his inclusion raised “serious questions about free speech”.Mr Clarke-Smith was reprimanded for referring to the committee’s inquiry into the former PM as a “witch-hunt which would put a banana republic to shame”.He said on Twitter: “Members of Parliament fulfil an important role in society and it is absolutely vital that they are able to scrutinise and comment on any matters relating to their work.“I am shocked and disappointed to be named in this new report.

These included a serving minister [Zac Goldsmith], a former leader of the House [Jacob Rees-Mogg] and a former secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport [Nadine Dorries], and at least three members of the House of Lords ... “who took it upon themselves to undermine procedures” of the Commons, the committee said. “We have not catalogued every tweet or TV appearance, but have set out in an annex to this report some of the most disturbing examples of the co-ordinated campaign to interfere with the work of the Committee,” they continued.The report highlights remarks by “the individuals referred to above and of others who followed their example”, they wrote, adding: “This matter is made more difficult because two of the members mounting the most vociferous attacks on the Committee did so from the platform of their own hosted TV shows.“Attacks by experienced Members are all the more concerning as they would have known that during the course of an investigation it was not possible for the Privileges Committee to respond to the attacks.”Breaking: Boris Johnson allies made ‘disturbing’ attack on democracy, says Partygate reportThursday 29 June 2023 09:25 , Andy Gregory A series of “disturbing” attacks launched by Boris Johnson’s against MPs investigating his Partygate claims undermined British democracy, the privileges committee has found.A scathing report named Jacob Rees-Mogg, Nadine Dorries, Zac Goldsmith and Priti Patel among the Johnson loyalists who made “unprecedented” and “unacceptable” attempts to damage the work of the cross-party group.The MPs catalogued the “most disturbing examples” of the “co-ordinated campaign to interfere with the work of the committee” in the new 14-page report.Our political correspondentAdam Forresthas more details in this breaking report, which you can refresh for updates:Boris Johnson allies made ‘disturbing’ attack on democracy, says report ‘Unprecedented’ attacks ‘raised significant security concerns’, say MPsThursday 29 June 2023 09:24 , Andy Gregory The “unprecedented” attack on MPs investigating Boris Johnson “raised significant security concerns” and had the “clear intention” of frustrating the intention of the House of Commons, the privileges committee report says.The MPs write: “Pressure was applied particularly to Conservative members of the Committee. “This had the clear intention to drive those members off the Committee and so to frustrate the intention of the House that the inquiry should be carried out, or to prevent the inquiry coming to a conclusion which the critics did not want. “There were also sustained attempts to undermine and challenge the impartiality of the Chair, who had been appointed to the Committee by unanimous decision of the House.“This unprecedented and co-ordinated pressure did not affect the conduct or outcome of our inquiry. However, it had significant personal impact on individual Members and raised significant security concerns.”Boris Johnson’s allies named in reportThursday 29 June 2023 09:13 , Andy Gregory A number of Boris Johnson’s allies have been named in the privileges committee’s new special report.It describes a “coordinated campaign of interference” which put “improper pressure” on the committee as it investigated the ex-PM, adding: “We have not catalogued every tweet or TV appearance, but have set out in an annex to this report some of the most disturbing examples of the co-ordinated campaign to interfere with the work of the Committee.”It highlights remarks by Jacob Rees-Mogg, Nadine Dorries, Andrea Jenkyns, Priti Patel, Michael Fabricant, Mark Jenkinson, Zac Goldsmith and Brendan Clarke-Smith.Breaking: Privileges committee publishes new special reportThursday 29 June 2023 09:06 , Andy Gregory The cross-party privileges committee has published its new “special report”, taking aim at allies of Boris Johnson who sought to undermine their investigation into the former prime minister.In its Partygate report published on 15 June, the Privileges Committee said: “From the outset of this inquiry there has been a sustained attempt, seemingly co-ordinated, to undermine the committee’s credibility and, more worryingly, that of those members serving on it.“The committee is concerned that if these behaviours go unchallenged, it will be impossible for the House to establish such a committee to conduct sensitive and important inquiries in the future.“The House must have a committee to defend its rights and privileges, and it must protect members of the House doing that duty from formal or informal attack or undermining designed to deter and prevent them from doing that duty.“We will be making a special report separately to the House dealing with these matters.”Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney to give evidence at Covid-19 inquiryThursday 29 June 2023 08:53 , Andy Gregory Alongside the expected arrival shortly of a new Partygate report, Scotland’s former first minister Nicola Sturgeon and former deputy first minister John Swinney will give evidence to the UK Covid-19 Inquiry on Thursday.Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly said the pandemic was one of the hardest things she has ever had to deal with in her political career.Senior Scottish government officials began giving evidence to the inquiry on Wednesday.Jeane Freeman, the former cabinet secretary for health and sport, said that while Scotland could have better handled the pandemic, there was ultimately “no plan” that could have helped the country cope with Covid-19.Nicola Sturgeon and John Swinney to give evidence at Covid-19 inquiry Tory peer says ‘kangaroo court’ should ‘hop less'Thursday 29 June 2023 08:21 , Andy GregoryOur political correspondentArchie Mitchellreports:Lord Cruddas, a Tory peer expected to be named in the Privileges Committee’s “special report”, has said the idea he intimidated MPs is “nonsense”.The staunch Boris Johnson supporter repeated the claim that the committee is a “kangaroo court”, adding that “if they don’t want people noticing, they should hop less”.Lord Cruddas, a businessman and Tory donor, also said the committee does not have the power to sanction members of the upper house.He said on Twitter: “The House of Lords is an independent body. Once again [the Privileges Committee] has embarrassed Parliament by not understanding basic law. The idea I ‘intimidated’ a committee of supposedly grown-up individuals is a nonsense.“Worse frankly, it is defamatory of me and I suspect it is yet more snobbery directed at someone from the working class who has succeeded in life from these career politicians.“Based on their ‘logic’ they are intimidating me and committing contempt of the House of Lords. If they don’t want people noticing they are a kangaroo court then they should hop less.”The Committee of Privileges is a House of Commons committee.

Deselections may follow.”And Mr Rees-Mogg has described the report’s findings were “fundamentally flawed”.Publishing the long-awaited report into whether Mr Johnson misled MPs over Partygate, the Privileges Committee said there had been “a sustained attempt, seemingly co-ordinated, to undermine the Committee’s credibility”.“We note that Mr Johnson at no point denounced this campaign while it was under way,” it added.As well as naming MPs, the special report is expected to identify members of the House of Lords who were part of the “coordinated campaign”.Conservative Lord Peter Cruddas, given his peerage by Mr Johnson, is also expected to be named having called the inquiry a “political show trial” and an “anti democratic abuse of justice”.Written ministerial statement due in Commons

Thursday morningThursday 29 June 2023 07:00 , Sam RkainaMPs  who ruled that Boris Johnson  lied to Parliament  with his partygate assurances are expected to publish a follow-up report detailing attempts to interfere with the inquiry this morning.The Privileges Committee published its report into the former prime minister earlier this month, concluding he committed “repeated contempts” of Parliament by deliberately misleading MPs with his partygate denials before being complicit in a campaign of abuse and intimidationThe seven-person panel, which was chaired by veteran Labour MP Harriet Harman  but had a Conservative majority, used its 106-page report to warn Mr Johnson’s most vocal defenders that they would face scrutiny themselves through a special update into attempts to undermine its work.It is expected that the follow-up document will be published on Thursday.According to sources cited by The Guardian, the special report will raise issues encountered by the committee during its initial inquiry, including whether statements by Mr Johnson’s supporters could be considered a contempt of Parliament in their own right.In its partygate report published on June 15, the Privileges Committee said: “From the outset of this inquiry there has been a sustained attempt, seemingly co-ordinated, to undermine the committee’s credibility and, more worryingly, that of those members serving on it.“The committee is concerned that if these behaviours go unchallenged, it will be impossible for the House to establish such a committee to conduct sensitive and important inquiries in the future.“The House must have a committee to defend its rights and privileges, and it must protect members of the House doing that duty from formal or informal attack or undermining designed to deter and prevent them from doing that duty.“We will be making a special report separately to the House dealing with these matters.”What did privileges committe say in the earlier

police probe into further potential breaches of Covid  laws at Downing Street , Chequers , inside parliament and the Conservative Party  headquarters is likely to cause Rishi Sunak  a headache for some time.It includes more gatherings attended by Boris Johnson  while he was prime minister, and a Christmas party where Tory staffers were invited to “jingle and mingle”.The investigation is likely to be ongoing when by-elections triggered by Mr Johnson’s resignation take place, with voters going to the polls in Uxbridge and South Ruislip on 20 July.On the same day, there will be a by-election in the North Yorkshire seat of Tory MP Nigel Adams, who resigned in support of the former prime minister.Metropolitan Police officers are assessing whether new evidence crosses the threshold for a full investigation, and will then decide if to send attendees questionnaires.Click here for the full story. ‘Honesty is too much to expect from the Tory blame game’Thursday 29 June 2023 05:30 , Namita Singh Those providing evidence to the Covid inquiry  are doing nothing if not living up to expectations, as they parrot lines of regret before denying any real responsibility for our woeful preparation for and management of  the pandemic.Each of the witnesses is at pains to shift the blame in the direction of some anonymous others.As Tom Peck so clearly describes , Matt Hancock, in his first appearance before the panel, attempted to manoeuvre the focus toward the lack of preparedness he inherited and the government’s prioritising of post-Brexit planning; both of which could not be blamed on him.Read more in this letter to the editor: Letters: Honesty is too much to expect from the Tory blame game Senior Tory at centre of Partygate row to become peer within weeks despite police

campaign.Shaun Bailey is under pressure to hand back his honour, received in Boris Johnson ’s controversial resignation honours list,  after an explosive video of the Partygate  event emerged.It showed members of Mr Bailey’s campaign team dancing at a Christmas party in December 2020, when indoor socialising was banned under strict tier 2 conditions.It later emerged that partygoers had been formally invited to what was billed as a “jingle and mingle” party.The Metropolitan Police have since announced that they have launched an investigation into the event.Despite the uproar, Mr Bailey is expected to be installed as the latest member of the House of Lords as early as the middle of July.‘Focus on future’ not Boris Johnson, says PMThursday 29 June 2023 04:30 , Namita Singh It comes as Rishi Sunak  said he wanted to “focus on the future”, as he sought to draw a line under the partygate saga following Boris Johnson’s exit from Parliament.The Prime Minister  has faced accusations of being too “weak” to stand up to his former party leader after missing Monday’s Commons vote on the Privileges Committee report.Mr Sunak has also not said whether he agrees with the highly critical report by the cross-party committee, which was backed by MPs  this week.Speaking to the media in Kent on Thursday, he said: “I have enormous respect for the Privileges Committee, support the Privileges Committee and indeed respect the vote of the House that we had on Monday regarding Boris Johnson.

restrictions.Secretary of State for the Home Department: HMICFRS Inspection Report: An inspection of the National Crime Agency’s effectiveness at dealing with corruption.                      Jess Phillips relieved the ‘system is bigger than demagogue’ Johnson                    Labour MP Jess Phillips has expressed relief that “the system is bigger than this demagogue”, as she praised the privileges committee for its report. “The idea that Boris Johnson didn’t understand the regulations ... I mean, it is a cracking defence on his part I have to say, because it basically means he is too stupid. He is either lying or he is thick,” Ms Phillips told MPs. The Birmingham Yardley MP added that the committee report reassured her there was “a lock on the system”, also describing it as “a valve to release the pressure”. She told MPs: “What I have seen for the past five years of people lying and deceiving, specifically Boris Johnson lying and deceiving, I felt like oh gosh, it is okay, the system is bigger than this demagogue, it is bigger than this man who thinks he is bigger than the world.”                      Tory MP says he is ‘so over Boris'                    A Conservative MP has claimed he is “so over Boris”, as he said telling the truth was a “keystone” of parliament. Isle of Wight MP Bob Seely told MPs he would vote for the report, but said: “I am so over Boris, and I am pretty over lockdown as well. I think sometimes, and really the point I want to make tonight is that we are in danger of making Westminster look small and petty.” While he described politicians telling the truth as “a keystone to this place”, he added: “The scandal of lockdown, or Covid and how we dealt with it, is not only whether there were ‘wine Fridays’ and cake in Downing Street, and people in protest carrying about pints of milk, but actually whether lockdown worked, the cost of lockdown in terms of lives, in terms of learning, in terms of sanity, in terms of money, and in terms of truth.”                      Nick Fletcher: ‘We must remember Boris is human too'                    Conservative Nick Fletcher, who said he will vote against the motion, urged MPs to remember Boris Johnson is “human” and that during Covid, he “nearly died”. The MP for Don Valley told the Commons: “We must also remember he is a human, too. In addition to running the country, he dealt with the highs and lows that this life brings. During Covid, he nearly died. He got married. He lost his mum and had a child.” He insisted committees like the Privileges one are “set up to fail”, adding: “Let me use a football analogy: if Man City’s star player had to sit in front of seven of his peers for the hearing, how fair would it be if three of the committee were Man United players? Not very. I think if we are going to use MPs as committee members, which I think we should, then they must be of the same party.” Meanwhile, Conservative MP for Guildford Angela Richardson said: “I deplore the attacks on members of the Privileges Committee. Whether they come from external commentators or within this House. The work of the committee is thankless, there is no need to make it potentially dangerous, too. The additional security that was needed is deeply shameful.” She told MPs that Harriet Harman, the Labour chairwoman of the Privileges Committee, is “an exceptional parliamentarian”, adding: “I also deplore the attacks on the member for Warrington South (Andy Carter), who is a voluntary magistrate, as well as serving his constituents in this place. Shame, shame, shame on those who are working to undermine him and his future prospects.”                      Watch: Ian McKellen spotted in House of Commons                                         Rees-Mogg says removing Boris’ pass ‘ridiculous'                    Conservative former cabinet minister Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was legitimate to challenge the findings of the Privileges Committee, and dismissed removing Boris Johnson’s parliamentary pass as “ridiculous”. Addressing the proposed 90-day suspension from the Commons, said: “A vindictive sanction, it seems to me, which they can’t implement because Mr Johnson has left Parliament. So they go from the vindictive to the ridiculous with not allowing him a parliamentary pass.” Addressing a comment from Labour MP Harriet Harman, who chaired the committee when it was producing the report, Sir Jacob said: “Suddenly we discover in this transparent approach that there was a secret agreement that her involvement was all right. Well, I was in the Government at the time, I never heard that this had happened.” He also told MPs: “It is absolutely legitimate to criticise the conduct of a committee, to criticise the members of a committee. That is politics. “Our politics is adversarial… it is open to us within this chamber to accuse people within the bounds of good order of saying things that we disagree with. Outside this chamber freedom of speech is paramount.” He added: “We must defend the right of freedom of speech. And, frankly, if politicians cannot cope with criticism you wonder what on earth they are doing with a political career.”                      Andrea Leadsom: We have to back a properly constituted committee                    MPs should “back a properly constituted committee” by voting in favour of the Privileges Committee report on Boris Johnson, Tory former Cabinet minister Dame Andrea Leadsom has said. She told Channel 4 News: “In my view, as a former leader of the Commons but also a real believer in the importance of parliamentary sovereignty, we have to back a properly constituted committee. “And it’s not right to simply say, ‘well, I don’t like its findings so I’m just going to bring into question its legitimacy’.” She also said she hoped enough MPs would support it so it would not need to come to a vote. “I’m hopeful that this will go through on the nod rather than having a division. “I want all members to accept the validity of that committee’s findings.”                      Johnson’s former aide speaks out in defence of ex-boss                    Lia Nici, former parliamentary private secretary for Boris Johnson, defended her old boss, saying the “prime minister is not the caretaker of the building, it is not their job to go round and look in rooms and decide who may be working and who may not be working”. The Tory MP for Great Grimsby said: “I have to speak in the House today because I cannot see where the evidence is where Boris Johnson misled Parliament knowingly, intentionally or recklessly ... The reality is -is that Boris Johnson did not knowingly or intentionally mislead this House.” She went on: “No 10 is full of police officers, full of security people. Why did nobody report this to the prime minister so that he was aware of it.” Intervening, Labour’s Jess Phillips asked: “Do think that there’s any chance that Boris Johnson could also have lied to her?” Ms Nici claimed: “Actually, no I don’t believe he did ... sadly I believe that unelected officials, some of them, because many, many are very, very good and very professional, but some of them made a choice not to inform the then prime minister because they wanted to cover their own backs, I’m very, very sad to say.” She said: “Sadly this is all becoming part of a kind of political opportunism for those people who don’t like Boris Johnson’s approach.”                      Johnson’s exit was ‘narcissistic howl of a man child’, says Labour MP                    Labour’s Dame Angela Eagle branded Boris Johnson’s departure the “narcissistic howl of a man child who won’t see that he only has himself to blame”. Of the report, she said: “It’s a damning verdict and one which I believe the whole House must not only note but vote to accept.” She added: “Boris Johnson and his acolytes have engaged in a systematic attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the committee and its work for their own purposes.” She went on: “It is beneath contempt for serving members of this House and the ex-Prime Minister to accuse the committee of being a kangaroo court or of being biased against him. In my view all those who’ve made such baseless accusations should themselves be referred to the Privileges Committee for contempt of this House.” She added: “He has left in disgrace, he has run from accountability for his lies and untruths. There has been no self-reflection, no apology, no acceptance of a shred of responsibility, just the narcissistic howl of a man child who won’t see that he only has himself to blame. “So egregious and so damaging for public trust in our democracy, Boris Johnson and his cheerleaders’ actions, it’s now imperative that this report is accepted.”                      Senior Tory Tobias Ellwood backs Partygate report                    Conservative former minister Tobias Ellwood said he would “vote in support” of the Privileges Committee report. He told MPs: “Even though Boris Johnson has absented himself from this House, almost to some degree making this report somewhat academic, the nation wants to see its conclusion, the nation who puts us here wants to make sure that this process reaches its conclusion.” Theresa May, speaking after Mr Ellwood’s intervention, said: “If people see us making rules for them and acting as if they are not for us that trust that I spoke about between the public and Parliament is undermined. “If they see members of this House trying to save the careers of friends who have been clearly found by due process to have been guilty of wrongdoing, as happened in the case of Owen Paterson, their respect for us is eroded. And without that trust and respect their faith in our very parliamentary democracy is damaged.”                      Watch: Labour MP asks ‘what would Covid victims say?’                                         Tory committee members subjected to ‘threats, intimidation and harassment’, says Harman                    Tory members of the Privileges Committee have had to withstand a campaign of “threats, intimidation and harassment” designed to challenge the legitimacy of the inquiry, MPs have heard. Labour veteran and Privileges Committee chair Harriet Harman thanked “every member of the Privileges Committee” for their “outstanding dedication and commitment”, adding: “But particularly the Conservative members of the committee. They have also had to be extraordinarily resilient. “They have had to withstand a campaign of threats, intimidation, and harassment designed to challenge the legitimacy of the inquiry, to drive them off the Committee and thereby frustrate the intention of the House that this inquiry should be carried out. Yet through all this, they have not given into the intimidation.” She added: “Attacks by honourable members on other honourable members designed to pre-empt the committee’s findings, frustrate the will of the House, erode public confidence and thereby undermine our democracy. They may themselves be contempt of the House because they are attempting to impede the functioning of the House. “We will be doing a further report to the House on this shortly inviting consideration of what could be done to prevent this happening in the future.” Load-Date: July 24, 2023  End of Document
