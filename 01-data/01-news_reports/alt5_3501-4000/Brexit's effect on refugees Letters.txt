   Brexit's effect on refugees; Letters East Anglian Daily Times August 21, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: FEATURES; LETTERS; Pg. 24 Length: 185 words Body   IN 2016, Nigel Farage stood before a poster of refugees entering a Turkish refugee camp, claiming that if we did not vote for Brexit, they would all be coming to the UK. The truth is that his Brexit has enabled and created a huge increase in asylum seekers and refugees coming to the UK. Our previous membership of the EU included our nation in the 'Dublin III Agreement'. This enabled the UK to establish asylum processing centres and camps in other European countries including France, Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Mr Farage and his resulting Brexit took this opportunity away completely. Thanks to this, the only place we have now to process asylum seekers and refugees is indeed the UK. Yes, thanks to Mr Farage and his Brexit Bus convincing people to Vote Brexit, we now have thousands of these poor and desperate people pouring across to us in small boats, trucks, etc. Brexit lost us the opportunity to process applications in other EU countries. Which, let us not forget, were friends and fellow members of ours, in a united community of nations, for close to half a century! JOHN BAILEY, South Yorkshire.
