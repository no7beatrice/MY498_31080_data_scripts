   Terrorism and cyber attack warning as 25 biggest threats facing Ireland revealed irishmirror.ie August 3, 2023 Thursday 10:33 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: IRISH NEWS; Version:1 Length: 1141 words Byline: By, Michael O'Toole Highlight: The list of 25 risks outlined in this year's National Risk Assessment vary in nature, ranging from unavoidable global risks, such as climate change, to acute hazards, such as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. Body   Ireland faces an increased threat from terrorism and cyber-attacks - because we spend so little money on defence, the government has admitted. This year's national risk assessment also finds that Ireland faces 25 different potential threats - from terrorism to financial instability, as well as climate change, AI and even housing problems. And the assessment, published on Wednesday morning by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, also warns that extremist groups here are trying to stoke up tensions about the rising levels of immigration. "The increase in the immigrant population in Ireland has occurred in a short time frame and with relatively limited upheaval compared to other countries. "However, social tensions can be exploited by extremist groups, such as through the spread of mis/disinformation, including by malevolent actors," the report says. But the report also reserves special mention for dangers posed to Ireland that are potentially made worse because of the low level of spending on the Defence Forces -who are meant to be able to protect us from external and internal threats. The assessment comes a year after the Commission on the Defence Forces warned the military would not be able to offer a meaningful defence of the country and made sweeping recommendations to solve the crisis. But 12 months on, the government-written risk assessment admits our low military spending could make threats even more dangerous. It says: "The risks to Ireland posed by armed conflict, terrorism and hybrid security threats are potentially compounded by our having one of the lowest levels of investment in military and defence capabilities within Europe." The report also highlights the vulnerability of vital undersea cables that run in Irish waters. The cables carry internet traffic between the US and Europe - but security experts have repeatedly warned that they could be attacked by saboteurs, including Russia. An attack that damaged one of the cables would have a devastating effect on world business and communication -but Ireland has no real way of protecting them. The report says the concerns are getting stronger - and also highlights the 2021 cyber-attack on the HSE which caused havoc here for months. It says: "Concerns about related threats to strategic infrastructure, cybersecurity and maritime security, including the risk to telecommunications and energy transmission infrastructure from acts of sabotage, have become more pressing. "The presence of significant communication and cloud infrastructure in Ireland exposes our country to an additional degree of risk from both State and non-State actors. "The potential disruptive effect of cyber-attacks was starkly demonstrated by the HSE cyber security incident in May 2021.  "Furthermore, the emergence of hybrid threats, utilising a mix of cyber and other methods, has expanded the potential vectors of attack. Foreign information manipulation and interference also poses a risk to the security of the State." The assessment also warns that failure to restore the power sharing government in Northern Ireland could cause problems for the whole island. It warns: "Restoring the devolved institutions following the May 2022 elections is vital in supporting political stability in Northern Ireland, including to address the legacy of the past and ongoing work to tackle residual paramilitarism. "Failure of post-Brexit arrangements or the continued absence of the Northern Ireland institutions would present a risk to political stability and its economic outlook, with potential significant implications for Ireland. "Strengthening relationships both on the island of Ireland, including through the Shared Island Initiative and between Britain and Ireland in a post-Brexit context remain key to this." The report also warns that Ireland is vulnerable to a global economic downturn - and says the recent international rose in inflation poses a substantial and immediate risk to the Irish economy. It also says that Ireland is particularly vulnerable to disruptions to supply or price rises in oil and gas -because of our location. We are at the edge of western Europe and have to pay more to get supplies here. And it highlights the risk posed to the Irish economy by Brexit - with challenges to the relationship between Ireland and Britain. It says: "Ireland's post-Brexit relationship with Great Britain will continue to present challenges, in particular as it diverges from the European Union. "These risks could impact upon trade and investment in both directions, even though mitigated by proximity, and interdependency such as in the area of renewable energy policy. "Brexit will also continue to have an impact on Ireland's trade with Great Britain, as the UK moves to introduce checks and controls on imports." And it warns all of society could be affected by a failure to solve the housing crisis. It says: "An inability to effectively and efficiently bring about an increase in the supply of housing risks creating a chronic situation, with associated implications for our society and economy. "Housing shortages and pricing issues are unlikely to rectify themselves over the short term with the COVID-19 pandemic having impacted housing completions and now increased construction material inflation, shortages in skilled labour, and rising viability challenges, all having an impact on supply. "Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated supply chain and inflationary issues, further undermining deliverability of an adequate housing stock." Welcoming the risk assessment, which has been published every year since 2014, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it was vital that the state knew the potential threats it faced. He said: "The list of 25 risks outlined in this year's National Risk Assessment vary in nature, ranging from unavoidable global risks, such as climate change, to acute hazards, such as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. "Many of the risks identified for 2023 have been identified in previous iterations of the National Risk Assessment, however many of these have evolved, given a changed social and economic context. Some risks have increased in significance, including those related to the security of our energy supply, fiscal sustainability, and protectionism and deglobalisation, and there are newer risks relating to the proliferation of disruptive technology, such as Artificial Intelligence. "Despite the varying nature of the identified risks, all require our awareness and our consideration, so that we can better prepare for their possible occurrence."
