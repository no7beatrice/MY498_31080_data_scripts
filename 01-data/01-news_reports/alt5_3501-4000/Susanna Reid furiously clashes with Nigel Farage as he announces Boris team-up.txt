   Susanna Reid furiously clashes with Nigel Farage as he announces Boris team-up irishmirror.ie June 14, 2023 Wednesday 10:21 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: TV; Version:1 Length: 400 words Byline: By, Charlotte McIntyre Highlight: Susanna Reid clashed with Nigel Farage on Tuesday's Good Morning Britain as he revealed he would team-up with Boris Johnson Body    Nigel Farage joined Susanna Reid and Richard Madeley on Good Morning Britain to explain why he would consider teaming-up with Boris Johnson after the former Prime Minister stepped down as an MP.   The former UKIP leader said: "We disagree on many things, we disagree on net zero we disagree on mass migration about which he's totally relaxed but on the biggest political issue of our lifetimes, Brexit we're on the same side.   "I think David Lammy made it perfectly clear yesterday that the Labour government's first priority is our relationship with the EU, they will take us back into single market rules."  Interjecting, Susanna hit back: "We don't know that." Nigel disagreed but the Good Morning Britain presenter insisted this was not something Labour have confirmed. "Can I just go back to my first question You literally on the record saying Brexit has failed...," Susanna said but Nigel interrupted and asked the host to "finish the sentence". "Brexit has failed in the eyes of many of its voters because of the government because they failed to deliver on immigration...they should have delivered what people voted for," Nigel claimed. Continuing, Susanna said: "Yet, you want to join up with the Prime Minister who is in charge of that failure." Nigel explained that he disagreed with the former Prime Minister on "immigration" and "net zero" but he agreed with him on the UK "being an independent country and not being part of a political Union in Europe". A frustrated Susanna asked: "Who screwed up Brexit" "Boris Johnson has messed up the implementation of it but....," he answered. Interrupting, the presenter asked:"Why would you want to go into partnership with him" The former UKIP leader argued that "two or three years down the line we may have to re-fight [the] battle [of Brexit]." Good Morning Britain viewers praised Susanna for grilling Nigel over his future political plans. One tweeted: "God I love @susannareid100. Real journalism. You are a fantastic addition to my mornings," and another added: "@susannareid100 did a brilliant job in chewing up Farage this morning. It was delicious."
