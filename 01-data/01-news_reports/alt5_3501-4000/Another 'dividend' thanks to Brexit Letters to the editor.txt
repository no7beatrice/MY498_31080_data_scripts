   Another 'dividend' thanks to Brexit; Letters to the editor The Press and Journal October 5, 2023 Thursday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Aberdeen Journals Ltd All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 26 Length: 193 words Body   Sir, - Even after the imposition of Brexit I've always felt at home in Europe: a European travelling on his own continent. Imagine my chagrin when that sentiment was challenged during a recent trip to Rhodes. I visited the acropolis at Lindos where pensioners are, on provision of documentary evidence, admitted at half-price. When I presented mine, the lady attendant explained "Europeans only" qualified. "But I'm European" I protested. With a rueful shrug, she responded: "Brexit." Albeit in a small way, I'd stumbled upon another downside of Brexit. The extra six euros I paid was nothing to the billions squandered on this self-defeating project, but the principle remains as I incurred an unnecessary additional cost. In Turkey we found the Turks, confronted with a rapidly depreciating domestic currency, evereager to get their hands on dollars or euros but not pounds sterling. My experience represented a cameo of the diminution in Britain's international status since Brexit. But when will our senior politicians see sense and initiate a policy to rejoin the EU with its myriad benefits? Whatever happens, I remain resolutely European. Ian D McCormick, Aboyne.
