   Pride in Brexit; LETTERS Scottish Daily Mail April 17, 2024 Wednesday Edition 1, Scotland  Copyright 2024 Associated Newpapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 46 Length: 160 words Body   IT'S sad to still see moaning, on the smallest of justifications, about Brexit (Letters). It's true that Brexit has not yet achieved its potential and has created some additional inconvenience and cost. But that's largely down to government failure to properly embrace its opportunities, control our borders and free us from the diktats of European courts, rather than Brexit itself. The pandemic has also played its part in hindering potential opportunity. What Brexit has done is put an end to Britain being pushed around by France and Germany, and freed us from control by the unelected European Commission and the need to support basket-case economies. For anyone who has pride in this country, these freedoms alone are surely worth some short-term costs. And to use a speculative financial forecast from a Munich-based insurance company to baldly state 'Brexit has been a disaster' is, with the greatest possible respect, arrant nonsense. F.J.
