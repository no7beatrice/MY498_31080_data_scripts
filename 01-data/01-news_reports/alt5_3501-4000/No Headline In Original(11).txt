WHILE no one seems able to explain the delays in completing the Borden Hill roundabout, perhaps the truth lies elsewhere. Having spoken to contractors carrying out work on the resurfacing of Luddington Road (which incidentally was completed one week ahead of schedule) I was informed that the real problem was that there is a financial dispute between the contractors and Warwickshire County Council. The council is refusing to pay for many of the additional costs accrued through problems being discovered during the building process, leading to a stalemate. I was told that there are no penalty clauses for late delivery of completion and so the contractors are in no hurry to finish the job but instead are intent on causing the council as much embarrassment and discomfort as possible until the situation is resolved. Is there any truth in this? It would seem to explain the absurd and unacceptable delays being incurred by the local residents and frankly anyone wishing to come to Stratford via this route. Could someone please tell us the truth. Stewart Hodges Stratford-upon-Avon New homes putting brook under pressure SOME weeks ago a letter in the Herald from a retired surveyor commented on the lack of wisdom in building a roundabout at the bottom of Bordon Hill. I'm sure many people, including myself, thought that letter made a lot of sense with traffic coming over the top of the hill at 50mph and having to brake very heavily to defy gravity and come to a stop at the roundabout. This isn't the only issue, of course, at this particular new roundabout. There are obviously huge problems regarding the drainage from 800 new homes, plus a new primary school, into Shottery Brook which travels under the new roundabout through the flood plain and into the river. To make matters even more of a worry, there is now a proposal to build a further 150 new homes actually on Bordon Hill itself. Have the planners taken this new development into consideration? Cliff Barnes Shottery Forget Brexit, Nimby tax is the big issue I READ Mr Baker's response, 'Need for frankness over Brexit disaster', (Herald 31st August) to my letter, 'Prioritise economic growth'(Herald 24th August). Mr Baker appeared not to understand the context of my comments. They were very specifically regarding the impact of the 2007 financial crisis, Covid and the war in Ukraine on public finances. I would agree with him that Brexit has not helped the UK economy. However, as I stated, the UK has suffered from 16 years of abysmal growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and productivity growth. This significantly predates Brexit. There appears to be a view amongst too many people that Brexit is the sole cause of our pitiful economic performance. This is I fear untrue. There is also a view that re-joining the EU would, at a stroke, solve our economic growth issues. This is little short of a fantasy. If the EU decided to let us re-join, and that is far from certain, the terms would be very different to the terms we had before we left, and nowhere near as advantageous. I was further intrigued by Mr Baker's comment that appeared to imply that the British people did not vote for Brexit. But, rightly or wrongly, they did. We need to move on from sterile debates over Brexit and tackle our issues head on. One of the causes of our slow growth was highlighted in a Financial Times article on 25th August entitled 'There is a Nimby tax on Britain and the US'. The article highlighted the high cost and lengthy duration of building infrastructure in the UK compared to other countries. An example quoted was HS2 which will cost £396m a mile and take an anticipated 23 years to deliver the initial phase. France opened a 188-mile stretch of its high-speed network in 2017 in 12 years at a cost of £46m per mile. Comparisons with other countries yield similar or even more depressing results. Comparisons on road infrastructure paint the same picture. The high cost and excessive length of time that it takes the UK to deliver infrastructure represents a huge drag on productivity and growth. The USA is a much richer country than the UK and is growing far faster so can withstand the 'Nimby tax' much more easily. I would stress that there are other issues that need to be tackled but the infrastructure issue is one of the most significant. I would conclude by reinforcing the point that the next government will need to put public finances on a more sustainable footing and drive economic growth. Without tackling both issues, the public services we take for granted, including the NHS, are unlikely to survive in anything like their current form. I think there will indeed be some very challenging tensions for us all to face. Tony Jefferson Stratford-upon-Avon Police do not care about noise and speed WITH reference to the letter in last week's Herald ('Difficulties of reporting noisy vehicles'), I was amazed that the police said to [the  writer] DBH that they have to be present and hear the noise levels. When was the last time you saw a Warwickshire Police vehicle or police officer monitoring traffic or using speed cameras in Stratford-upon-Avon? Their token, worthless effort is an infrequent traffic camera van situated by the Shipston Road roundabout near Waitrose where the road speed changes from 30mph to 40mph. Why can't this vehicle be also used on the Warwick Road where the road speed changes from 30mph to 50mph and is on a long straight road that the motorcyclists use as a racetrack going both in and out of town at speeds well above the speed limit. Then there is also the noise that these idiots make, which is unbelievable and can be heard all over town in the still of the evening. My opinion is that the police do not care about speeders or noise levels unless someone gets hurt or worse still, gets killed. Warwick Road resident              Stratford-upon-Avon AI presents an opportunity and a threat RECENT rapid advances in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) have led to a series of warnings from experts and calls for regulating. Prime minister Rishi Sunak recently made the case that the UK can be a global leader in its development and regulation and announced that the UK will host the first global summit in the autumn. Technology now offers the opportunity for the plodding, irrational, limited, analogue human to be augmented and transformed, or is it a threat to our humanity? As Prof Stephen Hawking warned, we may reach a stage where humans would not be able to compete - "the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race". Suddenly everyone is getting worried about AI. The country's top schools have warned of the "very real and present hazards and dangers" being presented by AI. The so-called godfather of AI, Dr Geoffrey Hinton, has resigned from Google, prophesying that the technology could up-end the job market. Another senior AI researcher warns of the possibility that a super-intelligent machine could wipe out humanity. AI, which has progressed at a spectacular pace recently, allows supercomputers to 'scrape' vast amounts of data from the worldwide web and process it with breath-taking speed to generate seemingly original content. Its sophistication is impressive. I read that one chatbot recently scored 96 per cent on an A-level maths paper. Apparently, half of all computer code is now AI generated. A woman in South Shields was freed from bowel cancer after AI spotted problematic tissue unseen by the human eye. Another AI tool, rolled out in three London hospitals can analyse heart MRI scans in just 20 seconds, compared with the 13 minutes it would take a doctor. Given the workforce crisis in the NHS AI could make clinicians' workload much more bearable. But it has a dark downside, which has led to predictions of a dystopian future. AI turns out to be biased on race, gender and other sensitive areas because the titanic amounts of web-text that it trawls contains a range of undesirable factors - from hate speech to points of view that exclude marginalised people and places. AI can be used to manipulate videos or recordings to create so-called deepfakes that show individuals doing or saying things that they never did. More insidiously, AI chatbots have been shown to make mistakes or make things up outright - a phenomenon known in the industry as "hallucinating" - which they can do with convincing authority. Interestingly politicians at the G7 summit last May in Hiroshima were talking about the need for "guardrails" around the development of AI. But there is little concrete agreement between governments on how to police it. One must assume that if this is going to be a tool in our futures, the answer is to use it through proper critical thinking. Nothing artificial about that intelligence. The ingredients for a confrontation are there - but so is the potential for enriching dialogue. Dr Roy Lodge Stratford-upon-Avon Second jobs ban for MPs WE are all well aware that an MP's commitment to a constituency is in inverse proportion to their need for effort to endure re-election. We all must wonder how a property portfolio and now a newspaper chairmanship will allow Mr Zahawi any time to think of, never mind work for, his constituents. Maybe the local Conservative office would like to explain again why they selected a man who would not pay his taxes and is showing further disdain for the role of representation by taking on more "second jobs." I do not think I am alone in wishing all our MPs would just do their first job of representing their constituents properly. It is time to ban second jobs. It is time Mr Zahawi did the honourable thing and admitted he is not interested in being our MP and stepped down. I can dream. A Allen Claverdon Nadhim Dorries MP: Missing politician.
