   David Cameron given top job in Sunak’s shock reshuffle as Braverman sacked – latest The Independent (United Kingdom) November 13, 2023 Monday 9:56 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: HOME NEWS,UK; Version:45 Length: 6388 words Byline: Athena Stavrou,Andy Gregory,Archie Mitchell,Namita Singh and Matt Mathers Highlight: Braverman sacking sees Cleverly shifted to Home Office, as Cameron becomes foreign secretary Body   Rishi Sunak has caused a political sensation by firing Suella Braverman  and appointing David Cameron as foreign secretary in a reshuffle of his top team. The prime minister sacked home secretary after claims that she incited violent protests by far right thugs at the Cenotaph on Armistice Day. Ms Braverman was replaced by James Cleverly, whose old foreign secretary brief was taken up by Mr Cameron, who was forced to resign as PM in 2016 after losing the EU referendum. Mr Sunak now faces the threat of a revolt from the Tory right, many of whom backed Ms Braverman’s provocative comments on “hateful” pro-Palestinian protestors that led to her dismissal.  Andrea Jenkyns, an arch-Boris Johnson loyalist, became the first MP to publicly submit a no-confidence letter in Mr Sunak on Monday night, declaring “enough is enough”.                      Key Points                                                                David Cameron becomes foreign secretary in shock appointment                       James Cleverly replaces Suella Braverman as home secretary                       Victoria Atkins appointed health secretary                       Steve Barclay moved from health to environment                       Therese Coffey quits as environment secretary                                                              Rishi Sunak opens first meeting of new Cabinet                    Rishi Sunak has said his new-look Cabinet would make the “big, bold decisions that will drive change”. Opening the first meeting of his top team since the changes which saw Lord David Cameron return to government, the Prime Minister said: “Looking around this table, I know that we have an energetic and enthusiastic team that is going to deliver for the country. “So, let’s get to work.”                      Tory chair praises new minister for ‘common sense’ Esther McVey                    The new Tory chairman Richard Holden praised “plain-speaking” right-winger Esther McVey after she was appointed “common sense” minister in the Cabinet Office. Appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said that Ms McVey was a “plain-speaking northerner from Merseyside, I think she’s a great addition to the broad team. “What Suella..,” Mr Holden said accidentally.                       Today presenter Nick Robinson asked him if that was a Freudian slip. Continuing, Mr Holden said: “What Esther is going to be doing is bringing that extra dimension to it … What you see is a broad church, Conservative party with a common goal, united together in what it is deciding to put forward to the country. Esther is part of that.”                      David Cameron arrives at Downing Stret                    Lord David Cameron has arrived at Downing Street for the first meeting of Rishi Sunak’s new-look Cabinet. The Foreign Secretary walked inside No 10 at 9.10am, accompanied by minister of state for development and Africa Andrew Mitchell. The former prime minister laughed after a Downing Street photographer asked him if he missed being “shouted at in the street”.                      Ministers begin to arrive at Downing Street for first meeting                    James Cleverly has arrived at Downing Street for the first meeting of Rishi Sunak’s new-look Cabinet. The Home Secretary walked inside No 10 at 9am. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott was the first minister to walk through the doors of No 10 at around 8.30am.                      Live: Rishi Sunak's Cabinet meet for first time after reshuffle                    Watch live from Downing Street as Rishi Sunak’s cabinet meets for the first time after Monday’s reshuffle:                      Sunak showed ‘bad manners’ in sacking Braverman, says Rees-Mogg                    Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg told Radio 4’s The World Tonight it was a “mistake” to sack Suella Braverman and accused the Prime Minister of ‘bad manners’ given the way she was sacked over the phone rather than face-to-face. “I think the problem for the prime minister was that what Suella Braverman was saying was actually very popular … to lose a senior minister to fire a senior minister … because he [Mr Sunak] is a bit sensitive about the language that is used is not wise.” Rees-Mogg was downbeat on the chances of Rishi Sunak overriding the European Court of Human Rights if the government loses the Rwanda case because the new home secretary James Cleverly has made clear he is opposed to such a radical move. “I think it almost doesn’t matter what the Supreme Court rules now because the power to override the section 39 injunction for want of a better word has to be exercised by the Home Secretary.  The law provides for that. “So the injunction will remain in place regardless of what our own courts rule. Now, I’d be delighted to be proved wrong, but I think it is made the Rwanda solution much, much, less likely to occur.”                      David Cameron in and Suella Braverman out – ask John Rentoul anything about Rishi Sunak’s cabinet reshuffle                                                                The Independent’s chief political commentator John Rentoul will be taking your questions as David Cameron makes a dramatic return to frontline politics:                                         Rishi Sunak’s dramatic cabinet reshuffle – ask John Rentoul anything                      Labour shadow chancellor criticises set-up of the House of Lords                    Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has criticised the set-up of the House of Lords. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the current configuration is “totally unjustifiable” and  “I think that the current set-up of the House of Lords is totally unjustifiable,” she said. “850 and rising members of the House of Lords, a couple of hundred more than we have in the House of Commons. “Non-elected, unaccountable, I don’t think that stacks up in the 21st century.” She added that a Labour government would reform the Lords. “For me, that would start with getting rid of the hereditary peers, which cannot be justified,” she said. “We want a second chamber that represents the nations and the regions of the United Kingdom.”                      Sunak brings Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom back into government                    Andrea Leadsom has been brought back into the fold as a junior minister in the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Rishi Sunak will be hoping that the return of the right-wing Brexiteer – formerly business secretary – will placate those angry at Ms Braverman’s exit. In a flurry of late-night appointments, Mr Sunak has also brought Laura Farris and Bim Afolami into the government as a minister in the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, and economic secretary to the Treasury, respectively. Simon Hoare was appointed to the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, meaning the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee will need to find a new chair.                      New Tory chairman says Braverman is 'totally entitled’ to her opinions                    New Tory chairman Richard Holden has said that Suella Braverman is “totally entitled” to her opinions. It comes as Westminster awaits a public response from the former home secretary to her sacking, amid fears of a right-wing backlash against Rishi Sunak. Mr Holden declined to give a view on her sacking but told Sky News that Mrs Braverman “is totally entitled to her opinions”. “I just say that all of us want to work collectively for the good of the country.” He has also stressed the need for unity across his party after backbench MP Dame Andrea Jenkyns submitted a no confidence letter in the Prime Minister.                      Sunak told to ‘prepare for war’ over Braverman sacking                    Rishi Sunak has risked reigniting a Conservative civil war following his cabinet reshuffle on Monday. The shocking turn of events saw the sacking of Suella Braverman and the appointment of former prime minister David Cameron as foreign secretary. Mr Sunak now faces the threat of a revolt from the Tory right, many of whom backed Ms Braverman’s provocative comments on “hateful” pro-Palestinian protestors that led to her dismissal. He was told to “prepare for war”, as right-wingers keen on revolt claimed that at least 54 of Ms Braverman’s outraged supporters could soon submit letters of no confidence and trigger a vote in his leadership. Andrea Jenkyns, an arch-Boris Johnson loyalist, became the first MP to publicly submit a no-confidence letter in Mr Sunak on Monday night, declaring “enough is enough”.                      What has David Cameron been doing since resigning from government?                    David Cameron  has made a surprise return to government  after Rishi Sunak  sacked home secretary Suella Braverman  on Monday morning and reshuffled his Cabinet. Ms Braverman was fired by Mr Sunak after making inflammatory comments in a newspaper article for The Times, which had not been approved by 10 Downing Street, accusing the Metropolitan Police  of exhibiting bias in its approach to political demonstrations.

ICYMI: Watch -David Cameron breaks silence on his return to government                    Former prime minister David Cameron has spoken for the first time since his appointment as the UK’s foreign secretary.

Speaking to Sky News, Mr Cameron said: “I know it’s not usual for a Prime Minister to come back in this way but I believe in public service. The prime minister asked me to do this job and it’s a time where we have some daunting challenges as a country.” Mr Cameron added: “I hope that six years as Prime Minister and 11 years leading the Conservative Pary gives me the experience to help the prime minister build our alliances.” Watch the clip here:  Watch: David Cameron breaks silence on his return to cabinet: ‘It’s not usual’                      David Cameron’s return is the last roll of the dice by a desperate PM…                    … but derision at Rishi Sunak pitching himself as the ‘candidate for change’ before asking a former prime minister for help will be worth it if it lends the Conservatives the semblance of stability ahead of a general election, writes Sean O’Grady: David Cameron’s return is the last roll of the dice by a desperate PM…                      Sacked! But don’t worry: Suella Braverman has next to no chance of becoming Tory leader                    Suella Braverman, as many predicted,is gone – Rishi Sunak has sacked his divisive home secretary as part of a reshuffle after the pro-Palestine march row turned nasty.  In doing so, the prime minister has effectively fired the starting gun in the battle to succeed him as Tory leader, writes John Rentoul. When (and let’s face it, it is when and not if) Sunak leads his party to defeat at the next election, Braverman has now laid her claim to be the right wing favourite to succeed him.

The broadcaster was among many to have celebrated Rishi Sunak’s decision  to remove Braverman from office after she accused Metropolitan Police  chiefs of bias in their handling of the pro-Palestine  protests.

Her sacking was welcomed by Tory moderates  who had called on the PM to fire Ms Braverman when she controversially claimed the police were “playing favourites”. But Mr Sunak has been told to “prepare for war”, warned that the move could provoke a full-scale revolt by more than 50 of her right-wing supporters keen for her to succeed Mr Sunak as party leader.
