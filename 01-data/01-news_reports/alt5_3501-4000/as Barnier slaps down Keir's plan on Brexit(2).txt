   ...as Barnier slaps down Keir's plan on Brexit Mail on Sunday (London) October 27, 2023 Friday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 16 Length: 128 words Body   MICHEL Barnier has slapped down Keir Starmer's plan to re-write the Brexit deal while staying outside the single market. The European Union's former chief Brexit negotiator said there was 'no room for renegotiation'. Sir Keir has vowed to secure a 'much better' deal with Brussels if Labour comes to power to 'make Brexit work'. But Mr Barnier said the single market cannot be 'unravelled'. He told ITV's Peston programme: 'There is no room for any kind of unravelling of the single market. We can improve some of the technical details... but we have to be out or in.' The Trade and Cooperation Agreement with the EU, negotiated by Boris Johnson, is up for review in 2025. The Tories have accused the Labour leader of wanting to re-open Brexit and 'hand power back to Brussels'. Load-Date: October 27, 2023  End of Document
