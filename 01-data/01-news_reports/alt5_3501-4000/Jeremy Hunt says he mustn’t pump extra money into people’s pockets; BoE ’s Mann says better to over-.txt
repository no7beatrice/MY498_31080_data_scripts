Catherine Mann will tell the Canadian Association for Business Economics that she believes it would be prudent to risk an error that can be more easily rectified. She says that it would be better to “err on the side of tightening further in order to prevent the risks of further inflation persistence from crystalizing.”  In a speech just released, Mann argues: If I am wrong, and there are excess negative effects to the real economy, it is an easier task to rectify as compared to regaining control over inflation. She then warns that leaving UK interest rates at their current level of 5.25% would risk letting inflation running too high, requiring tougher action to bring price pressures down. In a clear hint that Mann would push for another rate rise at the Bank’s meeting next month, she says: In my view, holding rates constant at the current level risks enabling further inflation persistence which will have to be unwound eventually with a worse trade-off.  If we underestimate the rise in the persistent component of inflation and set policy consistent with a world that may no longer exist we will ourselves contribute to the persistent overshoot of the target. And the longer this overshoot is allowed to continue, the more likely a departure from the old ‘low inflation, low volatility’ steady state.   Mann, who is known at one of the more hawkish members of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, also pushed back against calls for the Bank to ease off on bringing inflation all the way down to 2%. It’s a risky bet that inflation expectations are sufficiently well-anchored and to wait for core inflation to ease down, as this extends the duration way above the target-consistent rate. We need to prepare for a world where inflation is more likely to be volatile in the future, and the neutral nominal rate is likely to be higher than in the past. While these might support a “3% inflation is close enough”, popular in some circles, it cannot be our guide. We need to communicate and act on our commitment to do what is necessary to achieve the 2% target, sooner rather than later. block-time published-time 2.49pm BST   In the aerospace world, US aerospace and defence group RTX Corp has announced it expects to take a $3bn hit from problems with its Pratt & Whitney engines fitted to Airbus jets.  RTX says it expects to remove between 600 to 700 engines for ‘shop visits’ between 2023 and 2026, to remedy a problem involving contaminated powder metal discovered in July. These engine removals will lead to “higher aircraft on ground”, RTX says, rather than being able to fly.

It emerged on Sunday  that a parliamentary researcher with links to senior Conservatives and potential access to sensitive information had been arrested over allegations of spying for China. He has insisted he is “completely innocent”.  Speaking to Bloomberg TV  during a visit to Delhi, the chancellor said the government is “very confident that we will be able to keep the fabric and the functioning of our democracy secure.” He added that “we do not expect other countries to try and interfere with it,” and argued that the UK needs to keep speaking to Beijing. “Diplomacy is about talking to everyone, and Britain will always understand that. And of course when you have that dialog, you are able to talk about the things that you disagree about.” enltrChancellor Jeremy Hunt says the UK takes any attempt to subvert its democratic processes "very seriously," but spying allegations underscore the need for dialog with Beijing https://t.co/7r1N9LSKJh  — Bloomberg (@business) September 11, 2023 Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson refused to say today if the UK had raised the alleged spying case with China before last weekend (when the PM met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang during the G20 meeting). block-time published-time 12.58pm BST   Hunt: Mustn't pump extra money into people's pockets    UK chancellor Jeremy Hunt has told Bloomberg that it is ‘unlikely’ that he will have more fiscal firepower this autumn, to fund tax cuts or higher spending.  Speaking to Bloomberg TV today, Hunt says he doesn’t expect to have more fiscal headroom to hit his targets than in March, when it was the lowest on record. That’s because inflation has been stickier than forecast back in the Spring budget, meaning the UK’s debt repayments have been higher than expected. [ Back in spring, Hunt only had £6.5bn of headroom against his main fiscal rule  – to ensure that debt is falling as a share of national income between 2026/27 and 2027/28.] Hunt says today the government’s priority is to bring down inflation, so that will be the focus of the autumn statement in November, rather than to put ‘extra money’ into people’s pockets to help them. He explains: When you’re trying to bring down inflation, you have to be really careful not to pump extra money into the economy, much as you would like to. Not to pump extra money into people’s pockets, because that can push up prices and keep inflation higher for longer. enltr"When you're trying to bring down inflation, you have to be really careful not to pump extra money into the economy, much as you would like to" Chancellor Jeremy Hunt drops some hints at what to expect from the UK government's upcoming Autumn Statement https://t.co/x6KqlSZThl pic.twitter.com/4qYMXcZg1V  — Bloomberg TV (@BloombergTV) September 11, 2023 It was reported last week that the chancellor is considering real-terms cuts to working benefits in the autumn statement – ie, not raising them in line with inflation.

Nadine Houghton, GMB National Officer, said: “Wilko was far more than a brand, a retailer or the products it sold, it was the thousands of loyal team members now facing an uncertain future. “Wilko may have ceased genuinely being a family brand many years ago, but the staff kept the real family ethos of Wilko alive until the very end. It is the family that Wilko colleagues made for themselves that will be missed the most. “This isn’t a tragedy without cause. Wilko should have thrived in a bargain retail sector that is otherwise strong, but it was run into the ground by the business owners. “Money was siphoned out of the business for dividends, warnings about what needed to be done to save the business were not heeded and advice around what the business to do to thrive was not listened to. “No worker caused the downfall of Wilko.

She told reporters in Oxford: “I won’t comment on the figure because that creates difficulties in future negotiations. “What I will say is that we do provide some subsidy, very light subsidy, in the auto industry because it faces so much difficulty, and some of that is regulatory. “So if we’re asking manufacturers to transition to net zero, that creates additional costs which make it a little bit harder so we do have to factor that in. block-time published-time 11.48am BST   Kemi Badenoch also pointed to the ‘many headwinds’ which have hit the UK car industry, speaking at Mini’s Oxford plant today, saying: “The difficulties with supply chains post-Covid, increased energy costs because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the net zero transition which has been putting, we recognise, a lot of pressure on the auto industry. “But you are meeting and in fact exceeding the expectations just as we see this morning. “So I wanted to say thank you for that.” As flagged earlier ( see 8.05am  ), the car industry fears the new Brexit ‘rules of origin’ requirements will be another disruptive, costly headwind. block-time published-time 11.45am BST  Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch told staff at BMW’s plant this morning:  “We want auto manufacturing not just stay in the UK but to be the best in the world. “This is a part of that story. “We want you to have great jobs, well-paid jobs, that last for a very long time. “It doesn’t just happen.

Newsflash: BMW has confirmed “a new investment of more than £600m” at its Mini factories at Oxford and Swindon.   BMW says the move, “supported by the UK Government”, will help to secure jobs at the Oxford manufacturing plant and at the body-pressing facility in Swindon.  Milan Nedeljkovic, BMW’s board member responsible for production, says: “With this new investment we will develop the Oxford plant for production of the new generation of electric MINIs and set the path for purely electric car manufacturing in the future.” From 2026, the Oxford plant will build two new all-electric Mini models – the MINI Cooper 3-door and the compact crossover MINI Aceman. By 2030 production volume will be exclusively electric. Oxford currently makes the existing Mini Electric, as well as the 3-door, 5-door and Clubman versions of the classic UK car. Stefanie Wurst, Head of the Mini brand, says,  “Mini has always been aware of its history – Oxford is and remains the heart of the brand. I am delighted that the two new, fully electric MINI models – the MINI Cooper and MINI Aceman – are also being produced in Oxford, thereby confirming our path to a fully electric future.

The ZEV Mandate introduces ZEV targets  that will require an increasing percentage of a manufacturer’s annual new car and van sales in the UK to be zero emission until reaching 100% in 2035.  Walker explains: Having stuck to its guns on the mandate, the car industry now urgently wants the detail from Government. This would entrench the UK’s reputation as a stable and attractive place in which to invest in EV manufacturing. This shouldn’t be a hard task given that UK EV sales figures are already surging.  “Following the JLR battery factory commitment earlier in the year , this is good news for the future of the car industry. But more will be needed if the UK isn’t going to see its car industry return to rust again. 80% of the cars built in the UK are exported. Over 70% of these go to markets – the UK, 16 US states and China - that have committed to moving to electric vehicles. If the UK’s car industry doesn’t change to produce the EVs needed to meet that demand, it could find itself losing over £13bn a year in export revenue by 2030.”  block-time published-time 10.25am BST  The EC also forecasts that inflation across Europe will remain above the official target this year, and in 2024.

In simple terms, these have the effect of transferring contracts of employment (with all outstanding liabilities) to a buyer who carries on a similar business. They are designed to stop unscrupulous business buyers sacking staff or changing employment terms without compensating staff. However, they may also have the effect that a buyer of a large part of the Wilco business may be forced to take on employees in warehousing, office and other central functions- in addition to staff at stores they want to take. That cost may make the acquisition unviable. With bitter irony, the effect of regulations designed to protect employees could have the effect of making a rescue which saves jobs less likely. There are reports of ongoing discussion with other bidders. If successful bidders want a smaller number of sites, it may be possible to structure the deal so that the TUPE regulations do not transfer central employees leaving the position of warehouse, office and other central staff will be left very vulnerable. That is not a desirable outcome but may be all that is possible from this point. Another hurdle, though, is that some major suppliers want their debts repaid now  in order to continue to guarantee supplying Wilko’s stores.  Related:  Wilko: rescue deal to save many stores at risk over supplier debts  Whiteson adds: If these goods were supplied under a long terms contract this behaviour by the suppliers, if correctly reported, may fall foul of new legislation introduced during the pandemic period to prevent termination of supply on insolvency. Those new rules were designed to protect business rescues being torpedoed by suppliers who demanded payment of arrears or other sums on a customer’s insolvency. However, the new rules have not been fully tested through the courts and contain ambiguities which may be exposed on their application to particular cases.  block-time published-time 10.14am BST   The European Commission has also cut its forecasts for growth across the EU, and in the eurozone.  In its new summer forecasts, it says: The EU economy continues to grow, albeit with reduced momentum. The eurozone is now forecast to only expand by 0.8% this year, down from 1.1% forecast in the spring forecasts, and by 1.3% in 2024 (down from 1.6%). GDP across the whole EU is also foreccast to only rise by 0.8%, down from 1% expected before, and by 1.4% in 2024, (down from 1.7%).  Paolo Gentiloni, EU Commissioner for Economy, says: The EU avoided a recession last winter – no mean feat given the magnitude of the shocks that we have faced. This resilience, most evident in the strength of the labour market, is a testimony to the effectiveness of our common policy response. However, the multiple headwinds facing our economies this year have led to a weaker growth momentum than we projected in the spring. Inflation is declining, but at differing speeds across the EU. And Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine continues to cause not only human suffering but economic disruption. Yet we must have trust and confidence in the future of the European economy. There is much that we can do to support sustained and sustainable growth. The effective implementation of national recovery and resilience plans remains a key priority. Prudent, investment-friendly fiscal policies should be pursued, in sync with the ongoing efforts of our central banks to tame inflation. Lastly, we must work with determination to conclude an agreement on the reform of our fiscal rules by the end of the year. block-time published-time 10.10am BST   EC: German economy will shrink this year    Newsflash: The European Commission has predicted that Germany’s economy will shrink this year.  In its updated economic forecasts, just released, the EC forecasts that German GDP will fall by 0.4% this year, down from a previous forecast of 0.2% growth. The EC points out that Germany has been hit “particularly hard’ by the energy price shock following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying": Since January 2023, confidence indicators for manufacturing have been on a downward trend. This was particularly pronounced in the energy-intensive industries.  That would make Germany the worst-performing of the six largest EU members. The economy is expected to grow next year, but by less than expected. The EC says: In 2024, real GDP is forecast to rebound by 1.1% driven by a recovery in consumption. This is less than projected in the spring due to a slowdown in the construction sector, as well as to less dynamic exports growth. enltrGrowth forecast for the 6 largest EU economies for 2023 (%): ???? 2.2 ???? 1.0 ???? 0.9 ???? 0.5 ???? 0.5 ???? -0.4 ???? 1.4 Summer #ECForecast  ? — European Commission (@EU_Commission) September 11, 2023 block-time published-time 9.57am BST   The GMB union say the attempted Wilko rescue deal with Putman Investments has now “run out of time”, and blamed Wilko’s owners for the retailer’s collapse.

She explains: ‘’Wilko faces disappearing from the high street after a rescue bid to save the name and a vast chunk of stores appears to have collapsed. This is the news thousands of staff had been fearing, and with hopes of a white knight rescue receding into the distance, they are staring at the prospect of redundancy. B&M has already swooped into the bargain bin and picked up 51 stores from the administrators PwC and it’s likely that other value chains may still be hovering, ready to hoover up a handful of other outlets in cut-price deals. There is a chance that the brand itself may survive but as a range on another retailer’s shelves, and further deals are rumoured to potentially be announced this week. But it looks like the famous red and white shopfronts will be dismantled and Wilko will join Woolworths in the high street history books. The ditched deal could not come at a worse time for the high street, Streeter adds, amid the cost-of-living crisis and competition from online.  Wilko’s demise comes amid heightened warnings about the long-term decline of town and city centres, with shoplifting on the increase and boarded up outlets now commonplace.

They warn that an inflation-based increase to business rate would threaten “the viability of many shops and hindering the industry’s capacity to invest”. Currently, business rates are planned to increase in April 2024 in line with the inflation figure for September. This figure is due to be announced in October and is currently forecast at about 6%. They write: “Global supply chain issues are already likely to increase costs in the months ahead, including Russia’s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative and targeting of Ukrainian grain silos, plus restrictions on Indian rice exports and ongoing labour market challenges. “Against this backdrop, the Government should not make the situation worse by adding significantly to our cost base – freezing the business rates multiplier at its current level would avoid this.” Last night, prime minister Rishi Sunak refused to commit to keeping the pensions triple lock in the next Conservative manifesto, as he grapples with how to fund tax cuts demanded by his own MPs.

However, Honda said it was exiting its Swindon plant in 2019, resulting in thousands of job losses.  Today’s update on BMW is a win for the UK government, acting as a vote of confidence in Britain’s auto manufacturing sector and hopefully could pave the way for other car giants to follow suit.

Plummer says: “A BMW decision to keep electric MINI production in the UK provides a desperately needed stake in the future of the electrified car market and cements the continuation of Britain’s manufacturing heritage– something that’s been pulled into question since the impacts of Brexit have been felt in the automotive industry. “With an ever-growing number of electric vehicles on UK roads and the used electric car market showing record levels of demand, it’s clear EVs will be central to the future of the automotive industry and so it’s vital that Britain is actively engaged in the process.” block-time published-time 8.29am BST   Putman rescue bid for Wilko 'has collapsed'    Newsflash: back in the UK retail world, negotiations over a rescue deal that could have preserved hundreds of Wilko stores appears to have collapsed.

Those new tighter rules mean electric car batteries must be sourced from within the two trade partners or face 10% tariffs. Several carmakers have called for these rules to be negotiated, warning they will push up the cost of electric vehicles in showrooms.  Badenoch  adds that she is also speaking to the EU trade commmissioner about this issue, explaining: You will have seen the reports that he agrees with me. It’s something we’re working on.  Badenoch  argues that the rules made sense when the Brexit trade deal was negotiated, but that was before Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine created supply chain disruption. enltr"Do you think Brexit was good for the British car industry?" @JayneSeckerSky  speaks to @KemiBadenoch  following the annoucmenent on a major BMW investment deal https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3 ??

But, she won’t reveal how much exactly, telling Sky News: I can’t talk specifically about the investment amount because that is something that I promised BMW, because they want to be able to talk about their investment later on, at their event later today in Cowley, in Oxfordshire.

The government said BMW’s impending announcement means total investment into the country’s automotive sector has now topped £6bn over recent years. block-time published-time 7.50am BST   BMW’s new multi-million pound investment at its Oxford site will avert “a disaster” for the UK car industry, says Bloomberg.   But even so, UK automobile investment is lagging behind some rivals, they add: The company’s multimillion-pound outlay toward electric Mini production in Oxford averts what would have been a disaster for the UK, where car production slumped last year to the lowest since 1956. The factory employing more than 3,400 people was dealt a setback 11 months ago when BMW announced it was shifting electric Mini output to China.  While the revival of electric Mini assembly in Oxford adds to recent momentum for the UK car sector, the country isn’t keeping pace with nations taking more aggressive approaches to industrial policy. The more than £6bn ($7.5bn) of investment announced in Britain’s auto industry since 2020 pales in comparison to the $72bn that companies have earmarked for North America since the US passed the Inflation Reduction Act last year. block-time published-time 7.41am BST   Full story: BMW U-turns on plans to move electric Mini production from UK to China    BMW will unveil plans today to build its next-generation electric Mini in Oxford after securing a government funding package, in a move that will secure 4,000 jobs.  The decision by the German carmaker to invest in the Oxford plant is the result of “extensive” engagement with the UK government, according to the Department for Business and Trade. It is understood the commitment was made after the government promised tens of millions of taxpayer funds. It marks a reversal of fortunes for the UK, after BMW last year said  it would make most of its electric Minis in China, citing difficulty in producing electric vehicles and cars with internal combustion engines at the Cowley plant. The U-turn was hailed by government ministers including the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, who said BMW’s investment was “a huge vote of confidence in this country as a global leader in electric vehicles”.  Hunt said: “This industry is motoring, creating thousands of jobs and powering our green transition.” The government said BMW’s move represented a “multimillion-pound investment” but did not disclose a figure. The carmaker is expected to provide further details on the investment, including the total sum, later on Monday, with the taxpayer also providing government funding (previously reported at £75m).

The chair of the John Lewis Partnership is calling for the UK government to launch a new Royal Commission help rescue and restore Britain’s high streets. Dame Sharon White warns that the UK high street is in poor health, and that planning, taxation, crime, environmental policy, housing and transport all need to be considered together to find solutions. Writing in the Daily Telegraph today, she says: Too many towns and cities are shells of their former selves. Boarded-up shops left vacant , dwindling numbers of banks and post offices. And in their place, seemingly endless rows of vaping and charity shops. For too many local residents, the heart has been ripped out of their community. Britain has lost 6,000 shops in the past five years, according to the British Retail Consortium. There are John Lewis and Waitrose stores amongst these statistics, but the Partnership is still standing strong, with more than 360 physical shops nationwide. enltr?? Dame Sharon White calls for Royal Commission review into the ailing health of town centres https://t.co/41JHJaYEu7  — The Telegraph (@Telegraph) September 11, 2023 The collapse of Wilko this summer, which has already cost over 1,000 jobs , has highlighted the problems in retail.   Related:  More than 1,300 jobs to go as 52 Wilko stores shut down The sector has endured a tough 15 years. First the financial crisis triggered a recession, followed by a long programme of austerity that squeezed household incomes. The move to internet shopping forced more retailers to the wall, as the slump in the pound after the Brexit vote drove up import costs. Between 2013 and 2018, one in 12 shops closed.  And that process continued as the Covid-19 pandemic led to months of lockdowns, driving consumers to web shopping instead. Dame Sharon argues that a Royal Commission could consider the best mix of retail, hospitality, offices and housing needed locally, to return high strees to becoming more welcoming places where people want to live, work and spend time. She points out that the last Royal Commission into the health of UK towns was 180 years ago, so it’s time to put high streets under the spotlight again. Dame Sharon writes: Is it too naive to believe that, with an election approaching, the political parties could join forces for the good of the country on an agenda that aligns so closely with the Government’s levelling-up ambitions and the Opposition’s industrial strategy? Only a Royal Commission can set out a fresh vision for a prosperous high street for decades to come. Just as the 1848 Public Health Act offered the chance to make a real difference for citizens of Victorian Britain, our generation has the opportunity to leave a lasting legacy for our communities and high streets for decades to come. Britain’s high streets have hope, but they need help.
