   So can Brexit be blamed for anything else?; Letters Eastern Daily Press July 22, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 28,29 Length: 89 words Body   I VOTED to leave the EU, but after reading numerous remain letters, I'm beginning to see the other side of the argument, and how Brexit has put the UK into a lost decade (letters, July 1). I'm most annoyed with Brexit for deviously starting the Covid pandemic. Furthermore Brexit's dastardly role in sparking the Russian/ Ukraine conflict. And then, "quelle surprise," causing the second round of France's rioting and looting. Completing my conversion was Brexit's cruel role in relegating the Canaries.
