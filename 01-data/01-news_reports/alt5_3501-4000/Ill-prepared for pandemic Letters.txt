   Ill-prepared for pandemic; Letters Ipswich Star June 27, 2023 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Archant Community Media Ltd All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 8 Length: 193 words Body   THE Coronavirus Inquiry, still at its early stages, is proving to be quite enlightening in looking as it is currently on our preparedness for the pandemic. We have heard several wellinformed contributors telling us that we were ill-prepared. Partially this has been attributed to the decade of austerity that preceded it and which removed much of the resilience that the NHS had enjoyed in financially less stringent times and partially due to the impact of Brexit. The Government it seems was totally focused on 'delivering' Brexit and ignored or put to the back consideration of its primary role which is to protect our country and the public. Civil servants had been moved from these critical health-related areas to focusing on Brexit and its impact on the economy. Ministers took their eyes off the ball. Tragically it seems we can now add to Brexit's many challenges for our nation the possibility that it may have contributed to the Covid-related deaths of many of our citizens. We do not have to look far at all to find further Brexit calamities on an almost daily basis, this is just another, though probably one of the most serious. JOHN DELL, Shotley.
