   Labour-backed Brexit cuts us off; Letters to the editor The Courier May 31, 2024 Friday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 DC Thomson Co Ltd All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 27 Length: 181 words Body   Sir, - It was without a sense of irony that Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said that under a UK Government the Scotland Office would be "Scotland's window on to the world". Talking about promoting international links is all well and good, but this is from a party who are intent to continue limiting access to our key markets through backing Brexit. It is no understatement to say that Brexit has been disastrous for our businesses and consumers, limiting economic growth and restricting trade. Recent border controls will cost British business £2 billion through increased red tape, with the Scottish salmon industry alone suffering an additional £12 million of costs. Last year, almost half of businesses (44%) named Brexit as the main cause of difficulties trading overseas. Across every sector of Scotland's economy, Brexit has added red tape costs, limited access to vital workers and limited markets. Labour's ambitions may be to make the Scotland Office our window on to the world, but that window is currently half-closed due to the devastating impact of Brexit. Alex Orr. Edinburgh.
