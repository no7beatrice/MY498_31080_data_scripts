   Better united than divided; Letters East Anglian Daily Times December 28, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 28 Length: 197 words Body   LESLEY Brain (letters, December 14) wishes to hear no more of Brexit. The damaging repercussions of Brexit are becoming increasingly obvious. My Scottish family, relations and friends all campaigned and voted to keep Scotland within the United Kingdom. We still believe we are "better together" as a United Kingdom within a United Europe. Shortly after that Scottish referendum our vote and parliamentary wish to remain within the EU was disregarded. A dominant England took the whole of our "United Kingdom" out of a United Europe. People in England, Scotland Wales, N Ireland and our neighbours in Europe are now suffering the economic damage and destructive consequences of Brexit. The rich are ever richer the poor are poorer. The gap between never greater. The lies and false promises of Brexit were applauded by Trump, by Putin, by right wing nationalists across the world and by the super rich in the U.K. Lift your heads from the sand and you will see the damaging consequences of Brexit and the division of people and nations that it has incited. And you may then recall that nations and people are "better together" and Far Better United than divided. MARTIN DEIGHTON, Woodbridge. Load-Date: December 28, 2023  End of Document
