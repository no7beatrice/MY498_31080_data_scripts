The Mayor of London lamented the 'cost of Brexit crisis', claimed leaving the EU hit Britain for £140billion. But his mayoral opponents at this year's election told him to stop 'banging on about Brexit' and focus on cracking down on crime. Yesterday the Mail told how London has seen more than 1,000 homicides since Mr Khan was elected in May 2016. In his Mansion House speech, the Mr Khan told business and political leaders: 'It's now obvious that Brexit isn't working.' The Conservative London mayoral candidate Susan Hall said: 'Sadiq Khan always ends up banging on about Brexit when he gets into trouble. One thousand people have been killed on London's streets while he has been failing to lead the police, and his unfair Ulez expansion is ripping off families, businesses and charities.' Howard Cox, the Reform candidate, said: 'The London Mayor should butt out of national and international politics and focus on cutting knife crime.' Load-Date: January 12, 2024  End of Document
