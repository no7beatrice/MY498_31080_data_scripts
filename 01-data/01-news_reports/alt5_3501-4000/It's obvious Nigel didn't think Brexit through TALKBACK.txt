   It's obvious Nigel didn't think Brexit through; TALKBACK Birmingham Evening Mail June 2, 2023 Friday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Midland Independent Newspapers plc All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 24 Length: 189 words Body   NIGEL Farage blames incompetent politicians for Brexit's failure without, of course, giving us a clue what he thinks would have made Brexit successful. He created and supported the politicians who have built us a Brexit made of sand, let us be honest. Most of those who voted to leave didn't want foreigners coming here; they wanted an easy life without stress and high wages and plenty of affordable housing on tap. Nothing of substance will come from nothing of substance, Nigel. I expect he thought we could cut taxes and make ourselves a tax haven for the greedy. He expected we could compete with the exporting giants like China without putting in the hard work. Now his Brexit dam is springing leaks everywhere and our politicians are running around up to their armpits in failure. Get a backbone, Nigel, and admit you didn't think the thing through properly. Only about 9% of us think that Brexit is going well. Germany has seen a substantial amount of British companies setting up there. They see a failing future for this country and I, for one, will be very angry with those who are determined to cling to failure. Roger Watts, Walsall Load-Date: June 2, 2023  End of Document
