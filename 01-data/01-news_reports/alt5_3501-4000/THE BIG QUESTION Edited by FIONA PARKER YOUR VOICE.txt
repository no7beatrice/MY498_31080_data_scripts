   THE BIG QUESTION; Edited by FIONA PARKER YOUR VOICE Daily Mirror September 20, 2023 Wednesday Edition 1, Northern Ireland  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: FEATURES; OPINION, COLUMN; Pg. 36 Length: 191 words Byline: FIONA PARKER Body   Every day we'll be asking your opinion on one of Britain's big talking points. You can have your say and vote at www.mirror.co.uk Keir Starmer has promised to rewrite Boris Johnson's "thin" Brexit deal, which is up for review in 2025. Do you trust Keir Starmer to get a better Brexit deal? Yes. It makes sense. People voted for Brexit based on a parcel of lies which, along with the Government, has ruined our country. RentaNo. Looks like Starmer is trying to sneak the UK back into the EU through the back door. He and Labour aren't to be trusted over Brexit. EXPRESTONNo. It's tokenism hoping to gain some Remain votes but not lose any of the dwindling number of Leave votes. The EU made it clear a major rewrite isn't on the cards. JPFD Yes. Keir is right, Britain is alone now with absolutely no influence in the wider world. Brexit, the gift that keeps on giving. Flo Yes. By any yardstick you'd care to mention, Brexit is clearly not working. Even Farage admits that. So it's good that Keir Starmer is trying to fix it. FOGHORNNo. Brexit, by definition, can't be made to work, especially after the fact. Brexit precludes any cherry picking. EARTHCITIZEN Load-Date: September 20, 2023  End of Document
