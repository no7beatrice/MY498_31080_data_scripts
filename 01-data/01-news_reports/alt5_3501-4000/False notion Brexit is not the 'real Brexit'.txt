   False notion Brexit is not the 'real Brexit' Birmingham Evening Mail June 9, 2023 Friday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Midland Independent Newspapers plc All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 16 Length: 125 words Body   ALAN Spencer provides a detailed exposition of his views on Brexit (Talkback, June 3). He does however include one strange statement. He says that we've left only the institutions, not the EU. The institutions are the EU and leaving them means leaving the EU. Several countries have complex relationships with the EU. A great night Switzerland and Norway are both in the Single Market and Turkey is in the Customs Union. No-one suggests that these countries are in the EU. The UK (apart from Northern Ireland) isn't even in these. Several correspondents to Talkback have suggested that Brexit is not the "real Brexit". Perhaps they could explain in more detail what this "real Brexit" is and how we could go about achieving it.
