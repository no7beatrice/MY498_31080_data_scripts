   Now they're blaming Brexit for the falling fertility rate! Mail on Sunday (London) June 24, 2024 Monday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 4 Length: 194 words Byline: Alex Ward Body   BRITAIN'S falling fertility rate could have been exacerbated by Brexit, a European thinktank has claimed. 'Euroscepticism' was mentioned as a reason for a decline in UK births in a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Then, at the report's launch, Vienna-based researcher Tomas Sobotka said 'political polarisation' could affect fertility. He gave as an example 'Brexit in the UK, where this was politically supported overwhelmingly by the 50-plus generations, whereas young adults have completely different views and preferences around the issue'. In the OECD report's section on perceived uncertainties that could affect fertility, the authors claimed 'the rise of populism' could have an impact. But Reform's Lee Anderson said: 'Blame everything on Brexit. England played rubbish... blame that on Brexit as well. We've had probably one of the wettest years so far, blame that on Brexit. These people are just clutching at straws. You need to take what [they] say with a large pinch of salt.' OECD sources said that while Mr Sobotka did not contribute to the report, the authors referred to his papers in the chapter on fertility. Load-Date: June 26, 2024  End of Document
