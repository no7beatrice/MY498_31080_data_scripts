   Boris Johnson – latest: Tory MPs split over whether or not to approve ‘damning’ Partygate report The Independent (United Kingdom) June 15, 2023 Thursday 1:23 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: UK POLITICS,UK; Version:19 Length: 13299 words Byline: Matt Mathers,Joe Middleton and Maroosha Muzaffar Highlight: Despite scathing Privileges Committee report, Boris Johnson’s controversial honours list won’t be axed, Downing Street says Body   Tory MPs are reportedly torn over whether or not to approve the “damning” Partygate  report over Boris Johnson.   Some conservative MPs are reportedly “hovering” between voting for the report and abstaining, according to the BBC. A report into Partygate has laid bare Mr Johnson’s final disgrace, but No 10  said it will not axe his controversial resignation honours list. A cross-party committee of MPs found the former prime minister repeatedly lied to Parliament before being complicit in a campaign of abuse and intimidation. The Privileges Committee recommended a 90-day suspension which would have paved the way for a by-election if he had not dramatically quit. They concluded he should be barred from holding a pass to parliament. But Downing Street  said it had no plans to scrap Mr Johnson’s resignation list, in which he gave honours to allies embroiled in Partygate. “When it comes to honours, that’s a long-standing convention, the prime minister has abided by convention, that’s not going to change,” Rishi Sunak ’s spokesperson said. His arch-ally Nadine Dorries also said any Tory MP who votes to approve the report is “fundamentally not a Conservative”.

Chris Bryant, the chair of the Commons standards committee, told the Independent: “He’s a disgraced former prime minister. You really wouldn’t normally want a disgraced former minister carrying on in the Privy Council. “But I don’t suppose for a second that Boris Johnson has enough insight into what he’s done and feels at all accountable. So I don’t suppose for a second that he will stand down.” He added: “John Profumo was struck off from the privy council for having lied to parliament as a minister.” He also accused Rishi Sunak over “running for the hills over” the scandal. Tory peer Lord Lexden agreed Mr Johnson should no longer be a member of the Privy Council, saying: “To do it in the fevered atmosphere which exists at the moment would risk drawing the monarch into politics, and give Johnson yet another target for his acrimony. It should be done a little later.”What sanctions could Boris Johnson face?Thursday 15 June 2023 17:31 , Joe Middleton In an unprecedented ruling, the cross-party privileges committee has recommended that Boris Johnson be banned from parliament for 90 days, with members unanimously agreeing on a ban of at least 10 days – which would have been enough to trigger a by-election had he not resigned just days earlier.The committee now recommends that he should not be given a former member’s pass, which would effectively ban him from visiting parliament. But his fate ultimately lies in the hands of MPs, who will debate and vote on the committee’s findings on Monday.However, even if MPs do vote to revoke his pass, this decision would be rendered void were Johnson ever to be re-elected as an MP.On Monday, MPs could push for Johnson to be prevented from standing again, but the convention that no parliament can bind its successors means that only those at Conservative Party headquarters could truly stop him trying to be a Tory MP.Another potential route back to parliament that Johnson could consider is via the upper chamber.But according to a former member of the House of Lords appointment commission who spoke to the Financial Times, the committee’s verdict of “contempt” would “be an important factor to be taken into consideration”, and ultimately could enable the Lords commission to block any attempt to hand Johnson a peerage.With Johnson loyalists lining up to condemn the committee’s report ahead of Monday’s Commons showdown, as his critics call for his Honour’s List to be scrapped, it remains to be seen whether the inquiry, the vote – or perhaps a peerage-related snub – could prove to be the former PM’s final indignation.Nadine Dorries ‘off her rocker’, says senior ToryThursday 15 June 2023 17:15 , Joe Middleton Sunak allies told The Independent that Nadine Dorries was “off her rocker” by threatening deselections, and urged colleagues to “show backbone” when the crunch free vote to approve the cross-party report comes on Monday.One senior Tory told The Independent: “Nadine is off her rocker and biting the hand that put her in public life. She is making a show of herself.”Another senior Tory said colleagues should “show backbone” and ignore deselection threats made by Boris Johnson’s allies. “I hope colleagues have the integrity to vote how they want – never mind those stamping their feet.”However, the former minister predicted that there would be an “even mix” of Tory MPs abstain to avoid upsetting Boris-backing constituents, and voting it through to “support the process”. They said there was some “shock” in the Tory tearoom over the harshness of the 90-day suspension.Sunak will take time to ‘fully consider’ Partygate reportThursday 15 June 2023 17:04 , Joe Middleton Rishi Sunak will take time to “fully consider” the Privileges Committee’s report that found Boris Johnson lied to MPs, Downing Street has said.“He hasn’t yet had time to fully consider the report,” a No 10 spokesperson told reporters.“He intends to take the time to fully consider the report.”The spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister will participate in the Commons vote on the committee’s findings on Monday, saying: “We will set out the PM’s activity for next week on Monday.”Partygate report 'in danger of making House of Commons look foolish', Rees-Mogg saysThursday 15 June 2023 16:51 , Joe MiddletonThe five lies that doomed Boris JohnsonThursday 15 June 2023 16:45 , Joe Middleton When the long-awaited report into Boris Johnson’s lockdown lies about Partygate was published on Thursday morning, his resignation as an MP appeared a lot less shocking.The former prime minister had seen an early copy of the report, which concluded he had lied to MPs on an “unprecedented” scale. Had Mr Johnson stayed on as the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, he would have faced a 90-day suspension from Parliament -more than enough to trigger a tough by-election in the constituency.The report also recommended Mr Johnson be stripped of a pass for former MPs, effectively barring him from the parliamentary estate.Archie Mitchell reveals the five lies that led to Mr Johnson’s downfall:The five lies that doomed Boris Johnson Boris Johnson's former boss says ex-prime minister is not 'a decent human being'Thursday 15 June 2023 16:30 , Joe MiddletonBoris Johnson’s ‘sanction more than doubled in length after he attacked Privileges Committee’Thursday 15 June 2023 16:28 , Joe Middleton Boris Johnson’s recommended sanction more than doubled in length after he attacked the Privileges Committee, it has emerged.The former PM was going to face a recommended 40-day suspension from Parliament for repeatedly lying to MPs over Partygate, the Telegraph reported.But after being sent an early copy of the report, Mr Johnson lashed out at the committee, describing it as a “kangaroo court” before quitting as an MP. He said the committee members had “forced him out... anti-democratically”, leading MPs to bump up his sanction in the final copy of the report.While it ended up being merely symbolic after Mr Johnson’s resignation, the former PM faced a recommended 90-day ban from Parliament, more than enough to have triggered a byelection in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat had he stayed in post.For too long, too many Tory MPs have sustained Boris Johnson’s political career, says SNP MPThursday 15 June 2023 16:15 , Joe Middleton SNP MP Richard Thomson said Boris Johnsons has “done his best to mislead and misdirect” and then to “demonise” the committee that compiled the report into Partygate.He added: “I think every member of the Conservative party in the House of Commons has to examine their conscience when we come to vote on this on Monday.“Are they prepared to stand for that?

And if those members feel that they’ve acted in a bad way, or unhelpful way that goes against the principle of democracy and the best interests of the party, which I believe it has, then yes, they should be subject to de-selection,” he said.Former Tory MP says Boris Johnson ‘doesn’t care how much he lies'Thursday 15 June 2023 15:58 , Joe Middleton Former Tory MP Rory Stewart has said that the former prime minister “doesn’t care how much he lies, how many institutions he craps on, as long as he, Boris, manages to continue with his weird cult”.'He doesn't care how much he trashes, how much he lies, how many institutions he craps on -as long as he manages to continue with his weird cult!'Former Tory MP @RoryStewartUK  tells @mrjamesob  what he thinks of Boris Johnson. pic.twitter.com/MT7edLP6ra — LBC (@LBC) June 15, 2023 Former Tory MP labelled ‘crackers’ after claiming Partygate report was ‘revenge for Brexit’Thursday 15 June 2023 15:52 , Joe Middleton Former Tory MP Lord Jackson has been labelled “crackers” after claiming that the Partygate report written by the Privileges Committee was revenge against Boris Johnson due to his support for Brexit.Lord Jackson said: “It is a kangaroo court, the people there are politicians, they are masquerading as a quasi-judicial process, there are people with axes to grind.“There wasn’t due process in my opinion, he has been treated unfairly.

Is this some kind of smoking gun?Mr Johnson’s lawyers say not, and that that while the pair refer to “the party” they “only do so as shorthand, because that is what the event is being called in the media”.The lawyers add that it is “not a concession that the prime minister believed a ‘party’ or any kind of illicit or unauthorised gathering had taken place”.Angela Rayner labels Johnson 'pound shop Trump' after report finds he misled MPsThursday 15 June 2023 13:58 , Joe MiddletonBoris Johnson made fools of us all in Downing Street and must never be allowed back, says Max HastingsThursday 15 June 2023 13:53 , Joe Middleton Journalist and historian Max Hastings has said that Boris Johnson “made fools of us all in Downing Street and he must never be allowed to do so again.”The former editor of the Daily Telegraph said he didn’t hate the former prime minister, but that his character has always been known and he’s doing “what the dog does against the lampost”.He added: “The people I’ve got it in for are the people who supported him and still support him in the House of Commons and the Conservative party, when we know him for what he is.“Just to say ‘we don’t care if he’s a serial liar, we don’t care if he’s made fools of the British people by partying while the country suffered, all we care about is we think he can win elections and we think he’s a good bloke who the public warm to’.“I passionately reject that argument and we should reject the sort of people who are willing to go along with that argument. We want the restoration of truth in politics.”Mr Hastings said he wanted Rishi Sunak to succeed because he was a “decent person and Boris Johnson is not”.And he said that according to Mr Johnson’s own aides he ran a “crony-riddled shambles” while at No 10.He's doing "what the dog does against the lampost"Boris Johnson's former boss at the Daily Telegraph, Sir Max Hastings, says the former PM made "fools of us all in his time in Downing Street and he must never be allowed to do so again"https://t.co/8alkmlsivi pic.twitter.com/SAnKitd5lm — BBC Politics (@BBCPolitics) June 15, 2023 An unwelcome birthday gift for Boris JohnsonThursday 15 June 2023 13:34 , Joe Middleton As the the Observer’s Michael Savage has noted, the vote on the Partygate report will take place on Monday -the same day as Boris Johnson’s birthday.In the latest *a bit on the nose to be honest* piece of Westminster script writing, Monday's vote on the Boris partygate report will take place... on his birthday.h/t @tamcohen — Michael Savage (@michaelsavage) June 15, 2023 Revoking of pass like ‘switching off a child's Nintendo’, says Rees-MoggThursday 15 June 2023 13:28 , Joe Middleton Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said the conclusion of the privileges committee was “fundamentally wrong” and said his pass being revoked as like “switching off a child’s Nintendo ten minutes early”."I think their fundamental judgement is wrong."Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg says he doesn't believe former PM Boris Johnson deliberately misled Parliament, and his pass being revoked as like "switching off a child's Nintendo ten minutes early".https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3  Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/SchCL7zj48 — Sky News (@SkyNews) June 15, 2023 HOC will ‘inevitably’ vote in favour of Privileges Committee report, says Rees-MoggThursday 15 June 2023 13:18 , Joe Middleton The House of Commons will “inevitably” vote in favour of the Privileges Committee report finding Boris Johnson to have committed repeated contempts of Parliament, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said.“Inevitably Boris will lose the vote because you have the whole of the opposition against him... but you also have the Boris haters in the Conservative Party,” he told Sky News.The former Cabinet minister said Mr Johnson is “definitely not defeated”, but predicted he would not attempt a comeback to Parliament before the next election.Sir Jacob also likened the committee’s suggested sanction of revoking Mr Johnson’s parliamentary pass to “switching off a child’s Nintendo 10 minutes early”.Hunt backs Bank to further raise interest ratesThursday 15 June 2023 13:00 , Sam Rkaina Jeremy Hunt has said the UK has “no alternative” but to raise interest rates to tackle sticker-than-expected inflation.The chancellor said the government would support the Bank to do “what it takes” to bring down rising prices.“In the end, there is no alternative to bringing down inflation, if we want to see consumers spending, if we want to see businesses investing, if we want to see long-term growth and prosperity,” he told the BBC.Boris acting like ‘pound shop Donald Trump’, say LabourThursday 15 June 2023 13:00 , Matt Mathers Angela Rayner has blasted Boris Johnson branding him a “liar” who is acting like a “pound shop Donald Trump”,Adam Forrest reports.The deputy Labour leader said: “Boris Johnson is not only a law breaker but a liar, and he is not fit for public office.

I believed Boris before and I believe him today. This punishment is absolutely extraordinary to the point of sheer vindictiveness, and I will vote against this report on Monday.”Mr Clarke later said he would vote against the report’s findings.And one went as far as to suggest Mr Johnson’s treatment almost amounted to being moved around the country so members of the public can throw rotten food at him.Boris backer Sir James Duddridge said: “Why not go the full way, put Boris, in the stocks and providing rotten food to throw rotten food at him. Moving him around the marginals, so the country could share in the humiliation. History will hold Boris in higher regard than this committee.

He shouldn’t be anywhere near Parliament."She said: "People lost their loved ones and weren’t able to see people in their dying minutes while he was getting drunk at No 10, having parties knowing full well that that was completely unacceptable."He should have admitted it, he should have apologised and instead he is blaming everybody else."Sunak must give MPs a vote on report findings -LabourThursday 15 June 2023 11:36 , Matt Mathers Labour urged Rishi Sunak to hold a vote to approve the Privilege Committee report finding Boris Johnson is a “lawbreaker and a liar”, as well as its sanctions.Previous reports have suggested Mr Sunak would allow MPs a free vote on the report findings.Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire said: “The evidence in this report is damning and the conclusions the committee came to are clear: Boris Johnson is a lawbreaker and a liar.“Rishi Sunak must now confirm the Government will follow precedent and give the House the opportunity to approve the report and endorse the sanctions in full.“This report makes it even more inconceivable that the Prime Minister approved Boris Johnson’s resignation honours list just a week ago as part of some sort of grubby deal, rather than waiting for this report and saying ‘no’ to his former boss.”Committee has come under ‘constant intimidation’ from JohnsonThursday 15 June 2023 11:32 , Matt Mathers The privileges committee has come under “constant intimidation” from Boris Johnson, Labour has said.Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire also described the former PM’s behaviour as “shocking but not surprising”.She said: "I thank the committee members for the thoughtful and considered work that they’ve carried out over a year under constant intimidation from the former Prime Minister and his friends.“They did as we asked -diligently -and we should be grateful. I am disappointed to hear that the attacks on them -a committee with a conservative majority, a cross-party committee, properly constituted -those attacks continue today led by Mr Johnson.“His behaviour is shocking but not surprising. I was Shadow Leader of the house two years ago when he tried to rip up the rules to save his friend Patterson. Hundreds of Tory MPs voted with him -I’m afraid to say including the current Leader of the House."‘Wine time Fridays’ took place on a weekly basis -Downing Street officialThursday 15 June 2023 11:27 , Matt Mathers Wine-drinking gatherings took place in Downing Street on a “weekly basis” during the Covid pandemic, an unnamed Downing Street official said in written evidence to the committee.The official said No 10 was “slow” to enforce “any rules” in the building.The official said: “No. 10, despite setting the rules to the country, was slow to enforce any rules in the building.“The press office Wine Time Fridays continued throughout, social distancing was not enforced […]“This was all part of a wider culture of not adhering to any rules.

Mr Johnson also, of course, had personal knowledge of the gatherings”.‘Law-breaker and liar’ Johnson should apologise to public -RaynerThursday 15 June 2023 11:18 , Matt Mathers Boris Johnson is "not only a law-breaker but a liar" and should apologise to the British public, Angela Rayner has said in response to the Privileges Committee report.Labour’s deputy leader told broadcasters: "I think that Privileges Committee is pretty damning."You know, it’s serious."Boris Johnson is not only a law-breaker but a liar."He’s not fit for public office and he’s disgraced himself and continues to act like a pound-shop Trump in the way in which he tries to discredit anybody who criticises his actions when actually, a decent public servant would have done the honourable thing, would have had a little bit of humility and would have apologised to the British public for what they put them through."She added: "He should apologise to British people."Fabricant defends Johnson loyalistsThursday 15 June 2023 11:15 , Matt Mathers Conservative MP Michael Fabricant has defended critics of the Privileges Committee, saying its members are "normal MPs" and not "a court of cardinals".Sir Michael, who was given a knighthood by Boris Johnson, told BBC News on Thursday: "What I am concerned about is that a number of people have criticised others who have impugned the nature of the Privileges Committee, and what I do want to say was that I was there when Boris Johnson gave evidence to the committee."Now that committee stands in a quasi-judicial role, like a court of justice. And when Boris Johnson was answering questions, I could see members of the committee -not all of them, some of them behaved with great dignity as jurors would do in a court -but some of them were pulling faces, looking skywards, turning their backs on Boris Johnson."Justice doesn’t just have to be done, it has to be seen to be done. And you know, the Privileges Committee are normal MPs -or some of them may be abnormal MPs -but they’re not a court of cardinals."To sort of say, ‘well to impugn the integrity of the committee is some terrible thing’, as if you’re becoming a heretic in the days of Roman Catholicism in the 15th century, I think is just a little bit naive."Commons to debate report findings on MondayThursday 15 June 2023 11:11 , Matt Mathers MPs will debate the committee’s findings on Monday, it has been announced.Speaking in the chamber, Commons leader Penny Mordaunt confirmed the timings after Boris Johnson was found guilty of multiple contempts of parliament.Following the debate, MPs will vote on the committee’s findings, which would have suspended Mr Johnson for ninety days had he still been an MP.It also recommended that Johnson should be stripped of his parliamentary pass.‘Inconceivable’ that Sunak approved Johnson’s resignation honours list -LabourThursday 15 June 2023 10:53 , Matt Mathers Labour said the Privileges Committee report on Boris Johnson is “damning” and condemned Rishi Sunak as “weak” for not standing up to his predecessor.Shadow leader of the House of Commons Thangam Debbonaire said the findings make it “even more inconceivable” that Mr Sunak approved Mr Johnson’s resignation honours list last week.She said: “The evidence in this report is damning and the conclusions the committee came to are clear. Boris Johnson is a lawbreaker and a liar. Rishi Sunak must now confirm the government will follow precedent and give the House the opportunity to approve the report and endorse the sanctions in full.“Rishi Sunak’s weakness means he has never stood up to Boris Johnson. This report makes it even more inconceivable that the Prime Minister approved Boris Johnson’s resignation honours list just a week ago, as part of some sort of grubby deal rather than waiting for this report and saying ‘no’ to his former boss.“Rishi Sunak is so out of touch he thought it was right that taxpayers’ hard-earned money fund Boris Johnson’s ongoing lies to the public. Given the findings of the committee, Rishi Sunak should demand Boris Johnson pays back every penny.“While Rishi Sunak is distracted with the ongoing Tory soap opera people are crying out for leadership on the issues that matter to them.”The 7 most damning findings from the report into Boris Johnson misleading parliamentThursday 15 June 2023 10:50 , Matt Mathers A damning report by parliament‘s privileges committee has concluded that Boris Johnson misled parliament and recommended that he should be barred from having a parliamentary security pass in future.The 106 page document, put together by the cross-party group of MPs with a Tory majority, is packed with detail and arguments.Here are the seven most damning sections.Jon Stone reports: The 7 most damning findings from the report into Boris Johnson misleading parliament Watch: Lord Heseltine slams Boris Johnson's 'pack of lies' as report finds ex-PM misled ParliamentThursday 15 June 2023 10:48 , Matt MathersNow we know why Boris jumped.

He said the finding that he had deliberately misled MPs was "a lie" and that the committee’s approach had been "anti-democratic", "beneath contempt" and "the final knife-thrust" in his "protracted political assassination".Nadine Dorries threatens Tory MPs who back damning report that they face losing their seatsThursday 15 June 2023 10:36 , Matt Mathers Boris Johnson ultra-loyalist Nadine Dorries has threatened Conservative MPs who vote for the committee’s findings with deselection from their seats.She also accused the committee of “overreach” and lashed out at its members, who she claimed were biased against Mr Johnson.She said: “This report has overreached and revealed it’s true pre determined intentions. It’s quite bizarre. Harman declared her position before it began. Jenkins, the most senior MP on committee attended an ACTUAL party."Any Conservative MP who would vote for this report is fundamentally not a Conservative and will be held to account by members and the public. Deselections may follow. It’s serious."MPs will now have to show this committee what real justice looks like and how it’s done."Kate Devlin has the full report: Nadine Dorries in sinister warning to Tory MPs as Boris allies hit back Johnson should be banned from public office for life -Covid-19 Bereaved FamiliesThursday 15 June 2023 10:27 , Matt Mathers Boris Johnson "should never be allowed to stand for any form of public office again", a campaign group representing families bereaved in the pandemic has said, following the publication of the Privileges Committee report.David Garfinkel, spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said: "This is another grim reminder that whilst families like mine were saying goodbye to our loved ones over Zoom, the same prime minister that failed us so badly in the first place was breaking his own rules so he could have a party and a laugh."Johnson has shown no remorse. Instead he lied to our faces when he told us that he’d done ‘all he could’ to protect our loved ones."He lied again when he said the rules hadn’t been broken in Number 10, and he’s lied ever since when he’s denied it again and again."It’s an utter tragedy that Johnson was in charge when the pandemic struck and he should never be allowed to stand for any form of public office again."His fall from grace must serve as a lesson to other politicians to act with honesty and to serve the public as a whole -that is the only positive that can come from this."Johnson is a ‘liar and law-breaker’ -DaveyThursday 15 June 2023 10:25 , Matt Mathers Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described Boris Johnson as "a liar and law-breaker" in a tweet."He’s treated the public with utter disdain," Sir Ed posted.]"And while these Conservatives fight among themselves again, the country suffers."People are fed up.

A reasonable person looking at the events and the Rules would not have the belief that Mr Johnson has professed."16 events took place at No 10 and ChequersThursday 15 June 2023 09:59 , Sam Rkaina Some 16 potentially Covid rule-breaking events took place at No 10 and Chequers, Boris Johnson told the committee in a statement of truth,Kate Devlinreports.The committee says he has given them a "statement of truth" explaining 16 more events at No 10 and Chequers, his country retreat.The committee said that it had accepted his explanations at face value, because they did not want to delay the report’s findings.But they warn "If for any reasons it subsequently emerges that Mr Johnson’s explanations are not true, then he may have committed a further contempt.Boris accuses Partygate probe of lying about himThursday 15 June 2023 09:54 , Sam Rkaina In a statement Mr Johnson said: “The committee now says that I deliberately misled the House, and at the moment I spoke I was consciously concealing from the House my knowledge of illicit events. This is rubbish. It is a lie.”Mr Johnson also attacked what he said was a “deranged conclusion” , accusing the Tory-majority group of MPs he has repeatedly sought to disparage of lying.He called the committee led by Labour veteran Harriet Harman “beneath contempt” and claimed its 14-month investigation had delivered “what is intended to be the final knife-thrust in a protracted political assassination”.Johnson’s ‘deliberate lies’ could not be ‘brushed under the carpet’ -GrieveThursday 15 June 2023 09:52 , Matt Mathers Former attorney general Dominic Grieve said Mr Johnson’s “deliberate lies” could not be “brushed under the carpet”,Archie Mitchellreports.“Ministers are supposed to give honest accounts to the House of Commons on facts, and he did not do it,” Mr Grieve said.He lashed out at Mr Johnson’s attacks on the committee, branding it “the only mechanism by which the House of Commons can protect its privileges and enforce the standards it expects from MPs towards them.”Mr Grieve told Sky News: “Mr Johnson thinks this is something he can criticise, there is not a shred of evidence this committee has acted in a deliberately biassed fashion against him.”And Mr Grieve added: “It is completely unprecedented, but Mr Johnson is a completely unprecedented figure. We know he is a man who is a serial liar.“He lies not only to protect himself, but to smear other people, I have watched it during the course of his career.“Seeing that he did it so routinely and regularly in other settings, it doesn’t really come as a surprise that he lied through his back teeth about the circumstances relating to breaches of the rules in 10 Downing Street.”Commons could consider report on Boris Johnson’s birthdayThursday 15 June 2023 09:49 , Matt Mathers Boris Johnson could receive an unwelcome birthday present next week.The committee will now submit its findings to parliament for a vote, possibly on Monday -the same day as the ex-PM’s birthday.What a way to goThursday 15 June 2023 09:43 , Matt Mathers Our chief political commentatorJohn Rentoulgives his snap analysis:Now we can see why Boris Johnson decided to resign rather than to face the voters of Uxbridge: the findings of the Committee of Privileges, unanimously agreed and therefore signed off by all four Conservative MPs who hold the majority on that committee, are brutal.Never mind the speculation beforehand that the committee might conclude that the former prime minister had been reckless as to the truth of what he said in parliament about lockdown gatherings in Downing Street – the committee has gone full out, finding that Johnson “deliberately misled” the House of Commons about what he knew.The committee sweeps aside Johnson’s semi-philosophical defence, that it could not see into his mind at the time he said there were no parties and that the rules had been followed at all times: “The committee is entitled to conclude on all the evidence that Mr Johnson did not honestly believe what he said he believed or that he deliberately closed his mind to the obvious or to his own knowledge.”And when Johnson refused to accept the committee’s findings with good grace, submitting an argumentative letter at three minutes to midnight on Monday, the committee met again and rewrote the end of the report, escalating the dispute. If Johnson hadn’t resigned, the committee would have recommended suspension for 90 days – instead of the 10 needed to open the way for a by-election in Uxbridge. But the only thing it can do is recommend that he be denied a Palace of Westminster pass as a former MP. What a way for a prime minister to end their career.Johnson misled the Commons 5 timesThursday 15 June 2023 09:42 , Sam Rkaina The committee says Boris Johnson is guilty of "repeated contempts" of parliament across five different areas,Jon Stone reports.In its report, the committee said the former prime minister had misled the Commons by:Claiming Covid rules and guidance were followed at all times in Number 10 on four separate occasionsFailing to tell the House “about his own knowledge of the gatherings where the rules or guidance had been broken”Saying he relied on “repeated reassurances” that rules had not been brokenInsisting on waiting for Sue Gray’s report to be published before he could answer questions in the House, when he had “personal knowledge which he did not reveal”By claiming that rules and guidance had been followed while he was present at gatherings in Number 10 when he “purported to correct the record” in May 2022. The committee also found Mr Johnson had been “disingenuous” when giving evidence to them in six “ways which amount to misleading”.                      ‘Cynical attempt to manipulate public opinion'                    The committee accused Boris Johnson of a “cynical attempt to manipulate public opinion” after his televised appearance before members in March,Archie Mitchellreports. In its report, it said the former PM had accused members of “suppressing evidence which would be helpful to him”. After gathering the evidence Mr Johnson was referring to, he ended up “placing no reliance on it”. “The clear implication is that there was nothing in the evidence and his criticism in public was a cynical attempt to manipulate Member and public opinion,” the report concluded.                      Cut off Johnson’s PM allowance, Lib Dems urge Sunak                    The Liberal Democrats called for Rishi Sunak to cut off Mr Johnson’s allowance as a former prime minister,Archie Mitchell reports. He is entitled to claim up to £115,000 a year to fund office costs for life, but the party said Mr Johnson continuing to take the money would be “an insult to bereaved families who suffered while he lied and partied”. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: “This damning report should be the final nail in the coffin for Boris Johnson’s political career. It is completely unprecedented for a former Prime Minister to be found to have been a law-breaker and serial liar, who treated the public and Parliament with total disdain. “The Conservatives are so mired in sleaze and chaos that they are totally failing to tackle the problems facing the country, from the NHS crisis to the cost of living. Voters in Mid Bedfordshire will soon get a chance to send a message to this failing and out-of-touch Conservative government.”                      Johnson suspension would have been longer than Truss’s premiership                    Had he stayed an MP Boris Johnson faced being suspended from parliament for almost twice as long as Liz Truss was prime minister,Kate Devlinreport. A scathing report into Partygate recommends a 90 day suspension. His successor as prime minister, Ms Truss, was in Downing Street for just 49.                      No.10 pandemic garden party was social gathering                    A gathering held in the garden of Downing Street and attended by Boris Johnson during Covid was “social”, the committee found -Jon Stone reports. The committee report said: “The social nature of the gathering was indicated by the high number of people invited, with some attendees from outside No. 10 as well as Mr Johnson’s wife (who we consider it is obvious cannot be described as an “absolutely necessary participant”), and the installation in the garden of trestle tables with alcohol available.                      Johnson accused of ‘attacking our democratic instiutions’                    The Privileges Committee accused the former prime minister of “attacking our democratic institutions” after branding its probe a “kangaroo court”,Archie Mitchellreports. Its report stated: “Mr Johnson does not merely criticise the fairness of the Committee’s procedures; he also attacks in very strong, indeed vitriolic, terms the integrity, honesty and honour of its members. “He stated that the Committee had ‘forced him out […] anti-democratically’. “This attack on a committee carrying out its remit from the democratically elected House itself amounts to an attack on our democratic institutions. We consider that these statements are completely unacceptable.”                      Who was on the privileges committee?                    The privileges committee has found Boris Johnson guilty of deliberately misleading the Commmons over the Partygate scandal. It also concluded that he had committed multiple contempts of parliament after criticising the committee, having described it as a “kangaroo court.” Here is a full list of all the MPs who sat on the committee: Andy Carter MP -Conservative MP for Warrington South Alberto Costa MP -Conservative MP for South Leicestershire Allan Dorans MP -Scottish National Party MP for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock Yvonne Fovargue MP -Labour MP for Makerfield Rt Hon Harriet Harman KC MP -Labour MP for Camberwell and Peckham Sir Bernard Jenkin MP -Conservative MP for Harwich and North Essex Sir Charles Walker MP -Conservative MP for Broxbourne                      Boris Johnson report in full: Read all 30,000 words of Partygate committee findings                    The long-awaited investigation by MPs on the privileges committee into whether Boris Johnson  lied to parliament  over the Partygate  scandal has finally been published. The findings come more than a year after the inquiry was first commissioned by the former prime minister, in a move which failed to prevent his unceremonious ousting from Downing Street  less than three months later, swiftly followed by that of his immediate successor. Read the full report here:  In full: Read all 30,000 words of the Boris Johnson Partygate inquiry                      Committee explains why it found Johnson guilty of “multiple” contempts of parliament                    Here, the committee explains why it found Johnson guilty of “multiple” contempts of parliament. “We note that Mr Johnson at no point denounced this campaign while it was under way. Giving oral evidence, he expressed respect for the Committee and said, when pressed to do so, that he deprecated terms such as “witch hunt” and “kangaroo court”, but said “the people will judge for themselves” whether the Committee had been fair. Asked in relation to the Committee’s inquiry, “you would not characterise it as a witch hunt or a kangaroo court?”, he replied “I will wait to see how you proceed with the evidence that you have”.  Despite a later communication expressing confidence in the Committee (see paragraph 223 below), he intimated that he would only accept the Committee’s conclusions if they were favourable to him, which indeed is demonstrated by his abusive reaction to our warning letter, which we discuss further below. “Refusing to answer legitimate questions is contempt of parliament There is no basis for any fear that the requirement to be truthful with the House has a “chilling” effect on the ability of Ministers to be candid with the House.  The House will also be understanding if a Minister declines to answer, for example, on matters which relate to national security or market sensitivity.  But misleading intentionally or recklessly, refusing to answer legitimate questions, or failing to correct misleading statements, impedes or frustrates the functioning of the House and is a contempt.”                      Privileges Committee suggests Johnson should be barred from having parliamentary pass                    The Privileges Committee suggested Boris Johnson should be barred from having a parliamentary pass, which is normally available to former MPs. The committee said its provisional findings were that Mr Johnson deliberately misled the House and should be suspended for a period longer than 10 sitting days. But following his resignation statement and criticism of the committee, the MPs said that “if Mr Johnson were still a Member he should be suspended from the service of the House for 90 days for repeated contempts and for seeking to undermine the parliamentary process”. The committee said these included: Deliberately misleading the House, deliberately misleading the committee, breaching confidence, “impugning the committee and thereby undermining the democratic process of the House” and “being complicit in the campaign of abuse and attempted intimidation of the committee”. “We recommend that he should not be entitled to a former Member’s pass,” the MPs said.                      Johnson accuses committee of lying                    Boris Johnson accused the Privileges Committee of lying about him in the report. In a statement responding to the findings, Mr Johnson said: "The committee now says that I deliberately misled the House, and at the moment I spoke I was consciously concealing from the House my knowledge of illicit events. “This is rubbish. It is a lie. “When on Dec 1 2021 I told the House of Commons that ‘the guidance was followed completely’ (in Number 10) I meant it.”                      Johnson committed ‘repeated contempts’ of parliament                    Boris Johnson committed a second contempt of parliament by criticising the committee that found him guilty of lying to MPs over Partygate. The Privileges Committee said Mr Johnson committed a "serious contempt of the House" through his partygate denials. It said in the report: "We came to the view that some of Mr Johnson’s denials and explanations were so disingenuous that they were by their very nature deliberate attempts to mislead the committee and the House, while others demonstrated deliberation because of the frequency with which he closed his mind to the truth." It found he also breached confidentiality requirements in his resignation statement by criticising the committee’s provisional findings. "Mr Johnson’s conduct in making this statement is in itself a very serious contempt," the report said.                      No precedent for a PM to deliberately mislead Commons                    The report concluded: “We have concluded above that in deliberately misleading the House Mr Johnson committed a serious contempt. The contempt was all the more serious because it was committed by the Prime Minister, the most senior member of the government. There is no precedent for a Prime Minister having been found to have deliberately misled the House. He misled the House on an issue of the greatest importance to the House and to the public, and did so repeatedly. He declined our invitation to reconsider his assertions that what he said to the House was truthful. His defence to the allegation that he misled was an ex post facto justification and no more than an artifice. He misled the Committee in the presentation of his evidence”                      Johnson would have faced 90-day suspension                    Former prime minister Boris Johnson would have faced a recommended suspension of 90 days from the Commons for deliberately misleading MPs and "being complicit in the campaign of abuse and attempted intimidation" of the Privileges Committee, had he not quit his seat in protest.
