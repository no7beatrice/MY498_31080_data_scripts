   Reader letter: 'Passport price increase is apt symbol for Brexit' Bradford Telegraph and Argus March 26, 2024 Tuesday  Copyright 2024 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Length: 194 words Byline: Emma Clayton Body   SIR - 'Passport prices set to increase' from April 11, the T&A reported on March 25. Typically, it means we-ll be paying more for less...thanks to Brexit. Earlier this year, the Daily Mirror website reported on 10 things that have got worse for travellers since Brexit. That includes the ranking of our passports dropping from Number Three in the world to 22. The Passport Index by Arton Capital judges this on how many nations you can visit with and without visas. So, thanks to Brexit, we-ll be paying more for something that-s less valuable than it used to be. No wonder Boris Johnson-s father Stanley took advantage of the fact a French mother entitled him to a French passport. "Magnifique" is how Boris Johnson greeted news his father had secured one. Then Prime Minister Theresa May claimed in 2019: -The UK passport is an expression of our independence and sovereignty - symbolising our citizenship of a proud, great nation. That's why we have announced that the iconic blue passport will return after we leave the European Union.- Worse than a waste of time. Thus, an apt symbol for Brexit. Most British passports are made in Poland, by the way. Peter Brown, Wibsey Load-Date: March 26, 2024  End of Document
