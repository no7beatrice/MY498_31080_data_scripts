Lord Frost (inset) admitted that the former prime minister had "weaknesses" but praised his belief in Brexit in his latest swipe at the current government during remarks made at a think-tank event. The peer, who was appointed to the Lords by Mr Johnson and acted as his Brexit negotiator, also accused ministers of acting like the decision to leave the EU was an "awkward embarrassment". Speaking at the Legatum Institute, he called on Rishi Sunak to "double down" on the vision of the 2016 Brexit vote and the 2019 general election victory. "The 2016 referendum was a vote for change. But then old politics… messed it up," he said. Load-Date: June 27, 2023  End of Document
