   Top consultant's jibes at Brexit and the Tories Mail on Sunday (London) June 30, 2023 Friday Edition 2, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 7 Length: 159 words Body   A SENIOR doctor behind NHS strike action appeared to refer to Brexit voters as racist and accused the Conservatives of 'enabling pond life'. Mike Henley, the deputy chairman of the British Medical Association's consultants committee, made the remarks as part of a debate on Twitter. He wrote: 'In the same way that Brexit enabled racists, the Tory leadership contenders falling over themselves to "wage war on woke" is enabling another section of pond life.' He also said the UK had been 'manipulated into Brexit by Russian influence and money to destabilise Europe'. Tory MP Ben Bradley called the Derby-based surgeon's comments 'utterly disgraceful'. Fellow Tory Paul Bristow, who sits on the Commons health committee, accused the BMA of being 'more interested in knocking the Government than getting a fair and reasonable pay award'. The BMA claimed Dr Henley's comments, made last year, were not calling Brexit voters racist or saying Tories were 'pond life'. Load-Date: June 30, 2023  End of Document
