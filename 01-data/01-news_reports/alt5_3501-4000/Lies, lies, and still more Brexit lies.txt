   Lies, lies, and still more Brexit lies The Western Mail February 3, 2024 Saturday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 24 Length: 172 words Body   BEFORE the Brexit vote in 2016 Jacob Rees Mogg said that after Brexit, the price of food will come down. Daniel Hannan, now elevated to the Lords by Boris Johnson (remember him?) promised that 'from quantifiable empirical data' fuel bills and taxes would be lower'. Duncan Carswell (UKIP) promised food, energy and tax bills would be lower. Andrea Leadsom in 2016 said: "No one needs to fear our decision to leave the EU" and anyone who questioned the Leave data was accused of creating Project Fear. But yesterday the very same Andrea Leadsom said that Brexit bureaucracy, due to leaving the Single Market (and therefore subsequent price hikes), is the "price you pay" for sovereignty and businesses have pretty much got to get on with it. Well, Ms Leadsom, would you be kind enough to explain the impact of Brexit and the rising cost of living to our foodbank users, who are already hanging on by their fingertips. Unfortunately, you cannot eat sovereignty and sovereignty does not pay the bills. Catherine Pickles Buckfastleigh, Devon Load-Date: February 3, 2024  End of Document
