   Too many of us taken in by the big Brexit scam; LETTERS & VOICES Shropshire Star November 22, 2023 Wednesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 MNA All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 11 Length: 176 words Body   The Governor of the Bank of England has said Brexit is weakening our trading opportunities. How can that possibly be right when we were assured by the Jacob Rees-Moggs and Farages that Brexit would make us great again? They say that one in five UK adults are taken in by scams but as far as the big Brexit scam is concerned it amounted to over one in every three. The scam went something like this. Nigel Farage: "Did you know that there is a way of leaving a huge, close, protected market and doing even better by trading with countries thousands of miles away who don't actually need us? Behind your backs the EU is taking away £350 million a week which our NHS badly needs. Don't just take my word for it, Boris Johnson has given us his expert analysis of the situation." Of course those of us who think more deeply dismissed the Brexit claims and knew that a litany of scams would be doled out from the Johnson and Farage camps. The trouble with this country is that we can't be bothered to analyse in depth and plan accordingly. Roger Watts, West Midlands Load-Date: November 22, 2023  End of Document
