   Rishi Sunak -live: PM faces Commons grilling ahead of damning Boris Johnson report The Independent (United Kingdom) June 14, 2023 Wednesday 11:32 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: UK POLITICS,UK; Version:1 Length: 12951 words Byline: Matt Mathers Highlight: Privileges Committee publishes its report on Downing Street parties during pandemic on Wednesday Body   Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is facing a Commons grilling ahead of the release of a damning report into Boris Johnson.  Mr Sunak is going head to head with Labour leader Keir Starmer at Prime Ministers Questions.  The Privileges Committee is expected to say in its report that Boris Johnson deliberately misled parliament over parties in Downing Street during the pandemic. The report is expected to be finally made public on Thursday.  The committee has rejected the former prime minister’s defence that senior officials advised him Covid  rules and guidance had been followed in No 10, according to The Times. One senior Tory told The Independent they expect the publication of the report to finish off any chances of a return to politics for Mr Johnson, who resigned as an MP on Friday. But the former PM seems determined to fight, accusing the committee of “bias” and likening it to a “kangaroo court”, as he told the Express newspaper: “I’ll be back.”                      Key points                                                                Privileges Committee finds Johnson deliberately misled parliament – report                       ‘Johnson was warned against claiming social guidelines were followed’                       Boris Johnson pledges: “I’ll be back”                       Nadine Dorries claims she was ‘bullied’ by No 10                                                              Starmer: End the ‘excuses’ and call election ‘now’                    Sir Keir Starmer concluded by calling for a general election, saying: “End the boasting, the excuses, the Tory chaos, see if he can finally find somebody, anybody, anywhere to vote for him and call a general election now.” Rishi Sunak replied by criticising Labour for voting against the Government’s immigration reforms and measures to tackle disruptive protests, adding: “We’re getting on and delivering for the country.”                      Sunak asked if he will ‘buckle’ to Truss over her resignation list                    Sir Keir Starmer asked if Rishi Sunak will block the honours list of former prime minister Liz Truss or “buckle to her as well”. The Labour leader told the Commons: “There’s only one party that broke the economy and they’re sitting right there. And there’s a reason they can’t fix the problems facing the country because they never take responsibility for the damage that they’ve done. “And it’s not just Johnson – the Prime Minister’s immediate predecessor is hoping to reward those who made her reign such a rip-roaring success. “On her honours list are the masterminds of that kamikaze budget – the economic extremists of the Institute of Economic Affairs, those whose disastrous ideas crashed the economy and left the country to pick up the pieces. “Will the Prime Minister block that honours list or will he buckle to her as well?” Mr Sunak replied: “If you want disastrous economic ideas all you have to do is (look at) Labour’s economic policy on energy. It’s an energy policy that seeks to ban all new British oil and gas drilling, jeopardising 200,000 jobs and our energy security at a time of international conflict. “Despots like Putin are the only people who will welcome such a policy. His predecessor once said he wanted British jobs for British workers – his policy is British jobs for Russian workers.”                      Watch: ‘Honours should be for public service not Tory cronies’, Starmer says                    Sir Keir Starmer responded: “Honours should be for public service not Tory cronies.” He asked: “Isn’t this this case: He was too weak to block Johnson’s list, and that also means that those who spent their time helping cover up Johnson’s lawbreaking are rewarded by becoming lawmakers for the rest of their lives?” Echoing the prime minister’s words, Sir Keir added: “Is his message to the British public ‘if you don’t like it, tough’”? Rishi Sunak replied: “It is right that we use the honours system to recognise people. Almost 2,000 people a year from members of the England Lionesses team to the first Asian police officer in Greater Manchester. “But he talks about putting people in the House of Lords: perhaps he could explain why he put forward for a peerage the former Labour MP Tom Watson who spread vicious conspiracy theories that were totally and utterly untrue, damaged public discourse ad inflicted misery on innocent people?”                      Sunak: I upheld convention                    Rishi Sunak has insisted prime ministers from both parties “have always upheld the convention of non-interference on political honours”. His comments were in response to Sir Keir Starmer, who asked him in the Commons: “But the truth is for all his tough talk after the event, the prime minister did sign off the honours list. That means that those who threw a Downing Street party the night before the late Queen sat alone at her husband’s funeral will now receive awards from the King. “If he is so tough, why didn’t he block it?” The prime minister replied: “As I said, I and the government followed due process and convention. Prime ministers of both parties have always upheld the convention of non-interference on political honours. “My predecessors may not have agreed with Labour’s choices of Tom Watson or Shami Chakrabarti, but the same precedent stood then as it does now. And I’d expect a knight like him to understand that.”                      Starmer: Why are Tories arguing about who gets a peerage?                    Sir Keir Starmer has asked the prime minister why the Conservative Party "spent this last week arguing over which of them gets a peerage". The Labour leader told the Commons at Prime Minister’s Questions: "All across the country, people are worried about their bills, the price of the weekly shop and the spiralling mortgage rates. "So why has the Tory party spent this last week arguing over which of them gets a peerage?" Mr Sunak replied: "In line with a long-established convention of previous prime ministers having the ability to submit honours, I followed the process to the letter, in convention of long-standing process. "It is, by the way, a long-standing convention that prime ministers on both sides to this House have followed in the same way that I did."                      Sunak: My thoughts are with Nottingham victims                    Prime minister Rishi Sunak said the thoughts of all in the House of Commons are with the injured and the families of those who lost their lives in Nottingham. Speaking at the start of Prime Minister’s Questions, he said: "I know the whole House will want to thank the emergency services for their ongoing response to the shocking incident in Nottingham yesterday. "Our thoughts are with those injured and with the families of those who lost their lives."                      Coverage paused                    We’re pausing coverage on this for now.

The presenter formerly known as the Rt Hon Nadine is seething that two “posh boys”, Rishi Sunak  and his adviser James Forsyth, were behind moves to “duplicitously and cruelly” block her from getting a peerage.  “It kind of breaks my heart, because this story is about a girl from Liverpool who worked every day of her life, had something offered to her that people from that background don’t get offered, removed by two privileged posh boys who went to Winchester and Oxford”, she told Piers Morgan on his TalkTV show.

The former prime minister and the ex-culture secretary shocked Westminster when they announced they were quitting as MPs on Friday, triggering by-elections their party, currently struggling in the polls, could lose. They are both locked in a public spat with Rishi Sunak over her peerage, amid claims Mr Johnson did not know until recently his nominations had been blocked.

Lawyer Hugo Keith, who is counsel to the inquiry, said the coronavirus pandemic had brought “death and illness on an unprecedented scale” in modern Britain. He said that COVID-19 has been recorded as a cause of death for 226,977 people in the U.K. “The key issue is whether that impact was inevitable,” Keith said. “Were those terrible consequences inexorable, or were they avoidable or capable of mitigation?”                        Jill Lawless reports:                    COVID-19 inquiry in UK asks whether 'terrible consequences' could have been avoided                      No-deal Brexit ‘crowded out’ UK’s preparations for pandemic, Covid inquiry hears                    The government’s focus on Brexit  “crowded out and prevented” the work that was needed to prepare for the next pandemic, the lead lawyer to the Covid-19 inquiry has said. Hugo Keith KC told the inquiry that work around a no-deal exit from the EU  threatened by Boris Johnson  may have drained “the resources and capacity” that were needed for pandemic planning. The top lawyer told chair of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, that a lot of planning went into the “severe consequences of a no-deal exit on food and medicine supplies, travel and transport”.                        Adam Forrest has the full story:                    Brexit ‘crowded out’ UK’s preparations for Covid, inquiry hears                      Covid inquiry: Everything you need to know about public hearings into UK’s pandemic response                    The UK Covid-19 Inquiry opened its first public hearing on 13 June in London, beginning a three-year investigation into the British government’s response to the coronavirus  pandemic. The inquiry will seek to understand the decision-making that led to the imposition of strict lockdown  measures on the public, how our evolving understanding of the virus guided policy, what the government got right and what mistakes were made, with a view to being better prepared for future pandemics and public health emergencies. When then-prime minister Boris Johnson  announced the first “stay at home” order on 23 March 2020, British citizens came together in a rare moment of national unity, for the most part, diligently adhering to social restrictions introduced to help stop the spread of the contagious respiratory disease.                        Here’s everything you need to know about the public hearings into the UK’s pandemic response:                    Everything you need to know about the Covid inquiry                      Cabinet Office’s refusal to hand over documents to Covid Inquiry ‘corrosive’, inquiry hears                    The Cabinet Office’s refusal to hand over requested documents to the Covid Inquiry is “corrosive” and will damage confidence in the process, the inquiry has heard. Sam Jacobs, a lawyer representing the Trades Union Congress, said its position “smacks of having something to hide” and warned the “infighting” between Boris Johnson and the Government “jars with the terrible losses” suffered during the pandemic. “It (the Cabinet Office) is refusing even to return Mr Johnson‘s diaries to him as it knows Mr Johnson intends to provide them to the inquiry. Mr Johnson himself has been complaining to the Times newspaper of the Cabinet Office foot-dragging in response to the inquiry, of wasting public time and money by delaying the inquiry, and of deliberately frustrating the inquiry’s work. “My Lady, the infighting jars with the terrible losses described in the impact film that we watched this morning. “The position taken by the Cabinet Office is corrosive because it damages confidence in this inquiry. It smacks of having something to hide -of fighting tooth and nail to avoid revealing all to the inquiry. “What the public want to know is ... whether the Cabinet Office can approach this inquiry, not just now but going forward, with the spirit of openness and candour that we deserve. Those in the cabinet either have the will to respond openly to this inquiry, or they do not.” He added: “It is a matter of regret to is that these substantive hearings start under something of a cloud.”                      Johnson ‘was updated on resignation honours list by Cabinet Office before June’                    Boris Johnson  was given updates about his resignation honours list before he met with the Prime Minister  in June, it is understood. The former prime minister is involved in a public spat with Rishi Sunak  over his House of Lords nominations, after Nadine Dorries  and other allies missed out on getting peerages. Ms Dorries has claimed information about what was needed for her to pass the vetting process for nominees was not relayed to her in time and accused the Prime Minister of “duplicitously and cruelly” blocking her appointment. She used an interview with TalkTV to launch a fresh attack on Mr Sunak, claiming he used “weasel words” and “sophistry” in a meeting with Mr Johnson last week which left the outgoing MP believing she would be included.

Lord Rami Ranger has been forced to apologise after the inquiry found he had harassed the campaigner and journalist on Twitter  – calling her “the epitome of filth and garbage”. The top Tory donor also described the Indian journalist Poonam Joshi “a total nutcase” and referred to her “poor upbringing” following an argument at a Diwali event in parliament. Following a complaint from Ms Joshi, Lords standards commissioner Akbar Khan found Lord Ranger had bullied and harassed Ms Joshi by “persistently undermining, humiliating and denigrating” the journalist.

Former prime minister Boris Johnson ordered the investigation after Britain recorded one of the world’s highest death tolls.

At 12.28pm on Wednesday, December 8 2021, the then-prime minister stood at the dispatch box at Prime Minister ’s Questions to answer a question from Labour  MP Catherine West , eight days after the first reports of Downing Street  gatherings emerged. With a knowing smile, Ms West asked Mr Johnson to tell the house “whether there was a party in Downing Street on 13 November “. He stood up calmly, placing his notes on the historic despatch box, telling her firmly, “no,” before adding, “the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times”.

The former prime minister told his successor his dad should be honoured for his work for the Conservatives  and the environment, according to The Times. Frustrated at his father being cut from the list, Mr Johnson is said to have argued that it was customary for family members to be recognised in a PM’s resignation honours. But No 10 is said to have worried about how handing Stanley Johnson  a knighthood would be perceived.

Ms Dorries has claimed she resigned as an MP  after being “bullied” by No 10 and accused the prime minister of “duplicitously and cruelly” blocking her from getting a peerage. The Boris Johnson loyalist sought to divide the row along class lines, branding Mr Sunak and James Forsyth – his political aide – “privileged posh boys” who had stopped her from being offered a seat in the Lords. “I’m broken-hearted, not just for me but for everyone who comes from a background like mine,” she said.

Labour MP Emma Hardy (Hull West and Hessle) told the Commons: “Interest rates are up and mortgage deals are being pulled left, right and centre, yet the minister has had to be dragged here to answer this urgent question.” Referring to the rift between Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak over the former prime minister’s resignation honours list, she added: “Will the government please refocus on this mortgage crisis rather than the latest round of Conservative infighting, and give the public the reassurance it desperately needs?” Treasury minister Andrew Griffith replied: “I can give her the reassurance that focusing on the wellbeing of the nation’s mortgage holders, savers, pensioners, and investors is the whole of my focus, and I know that of my other colleagues on the Treasury bench. That is what we are focused on. “It is a feature of the UK mortgage market, as honourable Members on both sides will know, that from time to time mortgage deals are withdrawn from the market and repriced. “As of now there are over 5,000 mortgage offers from different suppliers at different tenures in the market and of course it remains my focus that those who seek to buy a first home or to re-mortgage their home do have the most competitive offers available.”                      Could tactical voting force Rishi Sunak out of No 10?                    Three by-elections occasioned by the sudden decisions of Boris Johnson  and two of his acolytes to leave the House of Commons.  None of them are contests that Rishi Sunak will relish, at a time when his party is still as much as 16 points behind Labour  in the national polls. Yet they are, nevertheless, three by-elections with a rather different character.                        The three upcoming crunch by-elections all have the potential to swing votes decisively for the main parties contesting them, writes John Curtice:                    Will tactical voting keep Rishi Sunak out of No 10? | John Curtice                      Year-on-year reduction in small boat crossings hailed by Sunak has shrunk further                    The year-on-year reduction in small boat crossings hailed by Rishi Sunak last week has shrunk further with another significant day for arrivals, our home affairs editor Lizzie Dearden writes. Home Office figures show that 545 migrants arrived in dinghies on Monday, following a 2023 daily record of 616 the previous day. Calm seas accompanying the UK’s current heatwave have provided favourable weather for the dangerous crossings, following weeks of rough conditions and high winds. Just last Monday, the prime minister visited Dover and launched a major speech proclaiming: “Our approach is working. For the first time, crossings are down by 20 per cent.” But the year-on-year drop has been cut to 11 per cent in recent days, and could disappear completely this week if fine weather continues to see high daily crossings. Experts had already cautioned that it was “too early to say” whether small boat crossings were on course for an overall reduction this year, and if government policy or other factors like the weather were behind recent changes. Yesterday, Home Office submissions to a Court of Appeal battle on asylum seeker accommodation said its “operational plans are based on scenarios of up to 56,000 small boat arrivals in 2023”, which would be a new record and a rise of over a fifth in 2022. With questions over how the new Illegal Migration Bill will be implemented -given the lack of detention centres to detain migrants or agreements to deport them -and an absence of evidence for ministers’ claims it will deter crossings, the PM’s pledge to “stop the boats” is looking very risky indeed.                      Watch: Moment Boris Johnson deliberately misled MPs on following Covid guidelines                    On Wednesday 14 June, Boris Johnson will reportedly be found to have deliberately misled MPs over parties in Downing Street during the pandemic. The Privileges Committee has rejected the former prime minister’s defence that senior officials advised him that Covid rules and guidance had been followed.

The likely sanction of suspension from the Commons has been rendered redundant, and the debate on the report will be missing his contributions. He has avoided a ritual humiliation  in the chamber at the hands of those who he considers dolts and fools and, on his own side, those who owe their ministerial jobs and cushy parliamentary lives to his campaigning genius.

In a short digression during his turn at London Tech Week , the prime minister  did not hold back: “Boris Johnson asked me to do something that I wasn’t prepared to do because I didn’t think it was right. That was to either overrule the Holac [House of Lords Appointments Commission] committee or to make promises for people. Now, I wasn’t prepared to do that. I didn’t think it was right, and if people don’t like that, then tough.” Harking back to his pledge to bring integrity, professionalism, and accountability into government, Mr Sunak went on to explain that he wanted to do things differently because he wanted to “change politics, and that’s what I’m doing”.

Sometimes there’s a surprising consensus on the course of events, but also a perplexing conflict over who said what to whom. In particular, the way the nominations for Boris Johnson’s resignation honours list were handled (especially peerages for Nadine Dorries and others), is particularly opaque.                        Sean O’Grady maps out a timeline of the fall of Boris Johnson:                    The fall of Boris Johnson: How we got here and what comes next                      Britain’s COVID inquiry launches with pledge to put bereaved at its heart                    The chair of Britain’s COVID-19 inquiry pledged to put the bereaved and those who suffered at the heart of her work as she began main hearings on Tuesday into how the coronavirus pandemic was handled. Former prime minister Boris Johnson had ordered the inquiry to look into the United Kingdom’s preparedness as well as the public health and economic response after Britain recorded one of the world’s highest death tolls from COVID. More than 175,000 deaths from the virus had been reported by the time Johnson stood down in July last year. “I have promised many times that those who have suffered hardship and loss are and will always be at the heart of the inquiry,” the chair, Heather Hallett, said at the start of the hearing. “I am listening to them. Their loss will be recognised.” Module one, which is looking into Britain’s preparedness for the pandemic, opened on Tuesday. The inquiry has held preliminary hearings, but this week will see the first evidence heard in the inquiry since it was formally launched in June 2022. With a national election expected next year, the detailed examination of decision-making could create political headaches for current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who was finance minister during the pandemic. However, evidence hearings on module two, which covers governance and decision-making in the pandemic, are not due to start until later in the year. The government has launched a legal challenge against the inquiry over its requests for internal government WhatsApp messages from Johnson‘s time in office which it says are “unambiguously irrelevant” to the inquiry. The inquiry argues that it is for the chair to determine what material is relevant. The legal case will be heard about the end of June.                      Tory turmoil over Johnson is having an impact on UK’s reputation, Starmer claims                    Tory infighting between Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak is damaging the UK’s reputation internationally and putting off investors, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer claimed. Mr Johnson, who formally quit Parliament on Monday in advance of a report which was expected to find he deliberately lied to MPs over the partygate scandal, has been involved in a public spat with Mr Sunak over his resignation honours list. Sir Keir said it “is certainly evidence of chaos” in the Tory party, claiming the by-elections triggered by Mr Johnson, Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams were “essentially political tantrums”. “Political parties usually fight like this when they’re out of office, it’s very unusual when they’re in office,” he said. But, Sir Keir told business chiefs at London Tech Week: “There is a price to be paid. “Everywhere you go across the country, most people are really worried about the cost of living, they are worrying about how they can pay their bills. “And for them to see a government squabbling with itself instead of focused on what they need addressed, I think is a very serious situation for this government. “And there’s a deeper price because there’s a reputation hit to the UK. And I think there’s an economic hit as well ... many investors said to me, we’re not investing in the UK right now because we don’t see the conditions of certainty and stability we need in order to invest.” Tory turmoil over Johnson is having an impact on UK’s reputation, Starmer claims                      First day of UK Covid-19 inquiry to begin with ‘difficult to watch’ video testimonies                    The voices of some of those who suffered most in the pandemic will be heard as the UK Covid-19 Inquiry officially begins its first day of evidence. Two years after then-prime minister Boris Johnson  announced a public inquiry would be set up, chairwoman Baroness Heather Hallett will formally open the first substantive hearing on Tuesday. Following her statement, a video featuring people from across the UK sharing their experiences of loss will be played to those gathered at the hearing centre in west London.                        Aine Fox has the full story:                    First day of Covid-19 inquiry to begin with ‘difficult to watch’ video testimonies                      Who is Charlotte Owen and why is she getting a peerage?                    A former aide to Boris Johnson  is set to become the youngest-ever peer after being included in his controversial resignation honours list.  Charlotte Owen, 29, joins former cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg and Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns in being elevated to the House of Lords by the ex-prime minister. Mr Johnson’s full honours list was published shortly before he resigned on Friday and sparked a political row with Rishi Sunak  after MPs Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams were omitted.                        My colleague Matt Mathers reports:                    All we know about Charlotte Owen as Boris Johnson makes her UK’s youngest peer                      Sir Keir Starmer: UK’s response to Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act a ‘critical question'                    Sir Keir Starmer said how the UK responds to Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act is a “critical question”. The Labour leader said President Biden’s $369bn package of subsidies for investment in green technology is drawing business away from Britain. “I can feel investors being drawn toward the US, and we need a response in the UK to that. We can not just sit it out,” Sir Keir told attendees at the London Tech Week conference. He added: “Creating those conditions for businesses to thrive is absolutely vital to us.” Sir Keir highlighted Labour’s so-called Green Prosperity Plan, which will see the party invest up to £28bn per year in climate-friendly projects until 2030 if it wins the next election. He said: “We have a plan that will be our equivalent of the Inflation Reduction Act. “It will give us lower bills, security, independence from tyrants like Putin and a real chance to grow our economy.” And, in a swipe at Rishi Sunak and chancellor Jeremy Hunt, Sir Keir added: “What I don’t believe in is a government that just looks at the problem and sits it out. “We have to be on the pitch, agile and active working in business to reap what will be the great rewards if we get this right.”                      ‘Weird’ for Boris career to be destroyed, says ex-spin doctor                    Former No 10 communications director Guto Harri said “miscommunication” was to blame for the feud between Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak over his honours. “I don’t think Rishi Sunak was trying to be malicious or malevolent, I don’t think Boris Johnson was careless,” he told TalkTV. Mr Harri said “something got lost in translation”, adding: “It’s all gone a little bit of horribly wrong.” Asked about the privileges committee’s Partygate report – set to find Mr Johnson deliberately misled parliament – Mr Harri said: “Forgive me if I think it’s a bit weird if he settled a £50 fine by police, but allow a committee ruled by a former Labour leader to destroy what’s left of his career.”                      Covid inquiry to look at Brexit impact on pandemic                    The Covid inquiry will examine the impact of Brexit on Britain’s readiness for the virus and the government’s handling of the pandemic. Two years after then-PM Boris Johnson announced a public inquiry would be set up, chairwoman Baroness Hallett will officially begin the first day of evidence on Tuesday. The first module – investigating the country’s preparedness for the crisis – will include evidence on “any impact arising from the UK’s departure from the European Union”.

The Privileges Committee has rejected the former prime minister’s defence that senior officials advised him Covid rules and guidance had been followed in No 10, according to the Times. But Mr Johnson – who resigned on Friday after receiving the group’s report – struck a defiant tone, quoting Arnold Schwarzenegger as he told the Daily Express: “I’ll be back.” The ex-MP accused the committee of “bias” and likened it to a “kangaroo court” in a furious 1,000-word exit statement after receiving a draft of its findings. The panel, chaired by Labour MP Harriet Harman but with a Conservative majority, found that one of his most senior officials in fact warned him against claiming social distancing guidelines were followed at the gatherings, the Times reported. The committee’s report is also expected to make clear that criticism of the committee should be considered contempt of parliament after Mr Johnson and his allies dismissed the inquiry as a “witch hunt”. Downing Street defended the group for having done “exactly what parliament asked them to do” while senior Tory MP Damian Green said it was “monstrous” the committee was being attacked for their work.                      Boris Johnson ‘pushed Sunak to knight father Stanley’ in crunch meeting with PM                    Boris Johnson is said to have pressed for his father Stanley to be given a knighthood during his crunch talks with Rishi Sunak on his honour list. The former prime minister told his successor his dad should be honoured for his work for the Conservatives and the environment, according to The Times. Frustrated at his father being cut from the list, Mr Johnson is said to have argued that it was customary for family members to be recognised in a PM’s resignation honours. But No 10 is said to have worried about how handing Stanley Johnson a knighthood would be perceived. A government source told the newspaper: “It just would have looked terrible.”                        Adam Forrest                     reports:                    Boris Johnson ‘pushed Sunak to knight father Stanley’ in crunch meeting                      ‘Posh boys’ at No 10 blocked my peerage, says Nadine Dorries                    Nadine Dorries has claimed “posh boys” – Rishi Sunak and his adviser James Forsyth – were behind moves to “duplicitously and cruelly” block her from getting a peerage. She used an interview with TalkTV to launch a fresh attack on the PM, claiming he used “weasel words” and “sophistry” in a meeting with Mr Johnson last week which left the outgoing MP believing she would be included. “I’m broken-hearted, not just for me but for everyone who comes from a background like mine,” she said. The ex-culture secretary claimed Mr Johnson’s own background is not a fair comparison because he attended Eton on a scholarship and has “no money”.

Instead, all hail the true gent'                    It’s sad that when most people write about the East End of London today, it’s done in relation to lattes, frappes, fancy flats and pricey olives. The reality is a bit different. For example, there’s still a really potent cockney presence in the area that scarcely gets talked about. It’s a living, breathing force of actual pride, which manifests in fabulously unsubtle ways: pearly queens getting gently mobbed, for example, or the occasional old-school cockney funeral passing by – featuring all the trimmings such as plumed horses and wooden carriages. It was seeing one of those grand spectacles pass by a few years ago that set me off on a wild train of thought, inspired by a flower arrangement in a hearse that just read “A True Gent”. What is “a true gent”, I wondered. How is it different to just calling someone a gentleman? Why did that phrase feel so profound in the context of a lavish cockney funeral, in a way it wouldn’t in some tepid marketing spiel or tabloid headline? Bear with me, I think I’ve cracked it.                        Oliver Keens                      writes:                    ‘Gentlemen’ like Boris Johnson are over.

The astonishing clash came as the former Tory leader faces the final reckoning of his political career after a Commons committee finalised its Partygate report – expected to find that the former PM deliberately lied to parliament about lockdown parties. Senior Tories expect the damning privileges committee findings to finish off any hopes of a comeback, telling The Independent that it would mark “the end of the circus”. However, Mr Johnson threatened just that on Monday, telling The Express newspaper: “As the great Arnold Schwarzenegger said, I’ll be back.”                        Adam Forrest                     and                       Archie Mitchell                     report:                    Boris Johnson: Sunak’s ‘talking rubbish’ – I didn’t ask PM to bend honours rules                      Boris Johnson ‘bullied’ prime minister over peerages                    Boris Johnson “bullied” the prime minister into accepting his appointment of allies to the House of Lords, parliament has been told. Former London mayoral candidate Sean Bailey, who was photographed with Tory aides at a mid-lockdown social gathering, was among seven nominees put forward for a peerage as part of the former PM’s resignation honours list. Others joining the unelected chamber are high-profile Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen and former No 10 chief of staff Dan Rosenfield. However, former culture secretary Nadine Dorries and ex-minister Nigel Adams were not among them. Mr Johnson’s camp accused Rishi Sunak of having “secretly blocked” their peerages, amid a public spat between the current and former prime ministers. In response, Ms Dorries and Mr Adams both announced they were immediately standing down as MPs -triggering by-elections. Pointing to the prospect of the new intake to the upper chamber, Labour former minister Lord Foulkes of Cumnock told parliament: “We will have an influx of new talent into this House -all of whom, sadly, appallingly and disgracefully, will be Conservative members, with no new opposition peers at all. “This list, put forward by Mr Boris Johnson, who bullied the prime minister into accepting it, is very interesting in many ways.”                      Voices of those who suffered most to be heard as Covid inquiry begins                    The voices of some of those who suffered most in the pandemic will be heard as the UK Covid-19 Inquiry officially begins its first day of evidence.

The panel, chaired by Labour  MP Harriet Harman but with a Conservative majority, found that one of his most senior officials in fact warned him against claiming social distancing guidelines were followed at the gatherings, the Times reported. According to the paper, Martin Reynolds, Mr Johnson’s principal private secretary at the time, advised him in December 2021 that he should remove a claim from a statement to the Commons  that “all guidance had been followed at all times”. The aide reportedly questioned “whether it was realistic to argue that all guidance had been followed at all times”. Mr Johnson is said to have removed the line from his opening statement, but repeated the assertion during a debate later – which the committee reportedly views as evidence MPs were deliberately misled.                      Privileges Committee finds Johnson deliberately misled parliament – report                    Boris Johnson  will reportedly be found on Wednesday to have deliberately misled MPs over parties in Downing Street during the pandemic. The Privileges Committee has rejected the former prime minister’s defence that senior officials advised him Covid  rules and guidance had been followed in No 10, according to the Times.

Sir John Curtice said tactical voting would be crucial in the seats up for grabs after Boris Johnson and two other Tory MPs quit the Commons. Mr Sunak is facing three difficult electoral tests in Mr Johnson’s former West London seat of Uxbridge and West Ruislip, as well as in the constituencies of Mid-Bedfordshire and Selby and Ainsty.

Former SNP leader arrested over financial scandal                    Nicola Sturgeon has been released without charge pending further investigation after she was arrested as part of a probe into the SNP’s finances. The former party leader has said she was “shocked and distressed” by the arrest on Sunday, stressing that “I know beyond doubt that I am in fact innocent of any wrongdoing’’.

The former leadership contender urged her party to spend less time on divisive issues and focus on “building more and taxing less” during an appearance at a Margaret Thatcher conference in London on Monday. Arguing that the electorate had not yet “sealed the deal” with Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour, Ms Mordaunt said: “I think there’s all to play for and I think that historic fifth term is within our grasp. Drop culture war battles, Penny Mordaunt tells Tories                      The fall of Boris Johnson: How we got here and what comes next                    In the fog of the Tory civil war it’s good to know how we got here, writesSean O’Grady The fall of Boris Johnson: How we got here and what comes next                      Boris Johnson pledges: “I’ll be back”                    Boris Johnson has pledged that he will return to frontline politics and vowed: “I’ll be back.” Speaking to the Daily Express, Mr Johnson said he intends to push the Tory party “to fully deliver on Brexit and on the 2019 manifesto”. He added: “We must smash Labour at the next election. Nothing less than absolute victory and total Brexit will do – and as the great Arnold Schwarzenegger said, I’ll be back.” It comes after an escalating war of words between the ex-PM and Rishi Sunak. Mr Johnson accused the prime minister of “talking rubbish” after Mr Sunak said his predecessor asked him to overrule the vetting committee for appointments to the House of Lords.                      Dorries resigned due to ‘sheer audacity’ of Chief Whip                    Nadine Dorries said the “significant thing” that made her resign was the “sheer audacity” of Chief Whip Simon Hart when he contacted her about the honours list. “It was the sheer audacity of the Chief Whip thinking that at my age having worked in Parliament for 21 years, serving 18 years on the back benches, having been a minister during Covid... having been a secretary of state, that he can dangle out to me some kind of stick and carrot, like ‘be a good girl and we’ll make sure something’s sorted for you in the future’, which is basically what he was saying to me. That for me, and that moment, was what made me change my mind,” she told TalkTV. She said she was “broken-hearted” that a woman from her background had had the appointment taken away from her “by two privileged posh boys who went to Winchester and Oxford, duplicitously and cruelly.”                      Nadine Dorries claims she was ‘bullied’ by No 10                    Nadine Dorries said she has been “bullied” by No 10 and decided she “can’t allow that to happen”. She denied “knifing the party” by triggering a by-election in her constituency,” telling TalkTV: “I think you come to a point in life when you have to stop, when you can’t just be pushed around, when you can’t allow people to bully you, as I’ve just been bullied by No 10. You can’t allow that to happen, you have to stand up for yourself, and that’s what I did.” The former culture secretary added: “It was a painful decision ... I didn’t want to cause a by-election.”                      Rishi Sunak: Boris Johnson 'asked me to do something I wasn't prepared to do'                                         Sunak ‘set to block Boris Johnson from standing again as Tory MP’                    Rishi Sunak will block any attempts that Boris Johnson makes to stand again to become a Tory MP, according to reports. The prime minister and Mr Johnson engaged in an escalating war of words today over the former prime minister’s failure to get a number of close allies elected to the House of Lords. A Tory source told The Guardian: “It’s the leader who is in charge of the party. Why would Rishi let Boris on to the candidate list?  “It’s pretty obvious to me that he won’t. The party needs to move forward from this clown show. The vast majority of MPs agree.”                      We mustn’t let AI cause a repeat of 1980s job losses -Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer has vowed not to allow Artificial Intelligence (AI) cause a repeat of widespread job losses seen during Margaret Thatcher’s deindustrialisation of the 1980s. Writing for The Independent, the Labour leader insisted that AI “must work for working people” – pledging a revolution in skills and training so Britain to avoid a major spike in employment. “We must also learn from the deindustrialisation of the 80s and tech revolution of the 90s, a time when manual and clerical jobs were being automated or sent abroad to be done in other countries,” said Sir Keir. Starmer vows not to let AI lead to job losses of Thatcher era                      Boris ‘pulling out the bricks’ as he leaves, says William Hague                    Fellow Tory leader William Hague also condemned Boris Johnson and his camp in his latest Times column – saying cries of “witch-hunt” against the privileges committee were “highly inaccurate and insulting”. Lord Hague attacked Mr Johnson’s “sadly irredeemable flaws”, saying: “The most serious of those has been a tendency to damage the institutions around him. Even as he bolts out of the door, Boris pulls out a few bricks from the wall of another vital institution, parliament.”                      Farage invited Boris to join forces with him                    Nigel Farage has invited Boris Johnson to join forces with him and the Reform Party and claimed they would have to re-fight the battle for Brexit if a Labour government wins the next election. Speaking on GB News he said: “There’s an open civil war now going on between Sunak and Johnson. I thought the Sunak comment, about the honours list and why some of them weren’t accepted, was Sunak saying, ‘he didn’t think it was right’. He’s kind of saying, Johnson’s dodgy. This is turning very, very nasty now.” He added: “If Johnson wants a future involved in active politics, and wants to try and fight for the Brexit legacy, which if there is a big Labour majority, could be game on again as far as Brexit is concerned, he’s got to consider doing something outside of the Conservative Party and that was why I talked about Reform.”                      EXCLUSIVE: Starmer vows not to let AI lead to job losses of Thatcher era                    Sir Keir Starmer has vowed not to allow Artificial Intelligence (AI) cause a repeat of widespread job losses seen during Margaret Thatcher’s deindustrialisation of the 1980s.

The Scottish Secretary appeared before Westminster’s Scottish Affairs Committee on Monday to discuss how the UK Government promotes Scotland abroad. He told the committee that the foreign representative had personally told him they were not comfortable with Holyrood ministers raising the issue of separation or Scotland’s re-entry to the European Union. He said: “Consuls of foreign countries have made this point to me directly that they find it uncomfortable when the Scottish Government raise separation, independence or other constitutional foreign affairs issues with them because they would no more want, if the French or the Spanish consul or ambassador would no more want to have to organise a meeting, or expect to organise a meeting with, say, the separatists in Catalonia or Corsica with UK Government ministers, nor would they expect us to meet with separatists from other countries. “They understand that we are one state -the United Kingdom -and it puts them in an invidious position and it is not appreciated”. He told Scottish Tory leader and Moray MP Douglas Ross that he had been trying to “de-escalate” the tension with the Scottish Government, however, had received “a lot of push back on it and no acknowledgement of these blatant breaches”.

Lord Howard ruled out any possibility of a Boris comeback.  “I think the Conservative party has learned that it can do without Boris Johnson and that the time has come to move on ... the time has come to draw a line under this psychodrama that has gone on for too long.”                      Labour jokes Tories are ‘too busy seriously disrupting themselves’ as Braverman announces protester legislation                    Suella Braverman’s announcement of legislation she says will crack down on “serious disruption” by protesters has been seized by Labour as the butt of jokes about the row over Boris Johnson’s resignation, our home affairs editorLizzie Dearden writes. The home secretary spoke in the House of Commons on Monday afternoon to announce a controversial statutory instrument that would further lower the threshold for police intervention in demonstrations. The law faces a rare “fatal motion” in the House of Lords on Tuesday, backed by peers outraged by the government’s use of a parliamentary bypass to bring in powers they previously voted down. But Monday’s debate in the Commons quickly verged into wider matters, with Labour shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper saying the Conservatives were “too busy seriously disrupting themselves” to govern. “You can see why Conservative ministers might be worried about an organised minority of people causing disruption, protesting against decisions made by the prime minister with no respect for the rules,” she added. “Yes, the public are sick of them and it’s why we want to get rid of all of them in a general election.” Ms Cooper said the new legislation, which can come into effect without parliamentary scrutiny, was “making the same claims” as two wide-ranging protest laws brought in over the last two years. “You’ve got to wonder how chaotic and incompetent this home secretary is that she has to keep legislating for the same things again and again,” she added. “The government is making it possible to go after peaceful protesters and passers-by. That is not the British tradition.” Several opposition politicians questioned the vague wording of the law, which states that police can impose conditions on protests that cause disruption that “may be more than minor”, to the “community” -within and outside the “vicinity of the procession”. SNP MP Alison Thewliss asked: “What is minor? Is it a couple of minutes late? What does ‘affected’ mean? It’s really unclear in this legislation, which will give police a huge amount of discretion.”                      Boris Johnson: Sunak’s ‘talking rubbish’ – I didn’t ask PM to bend honours rules                    Boris Johnson has accused Rishi Sunak of “talking rubbish” over his House of Lords nominations as the increasingly bitter feud between the prime minister and his predecessor descended into open warfare.

Sometimes there’s a surprising consensus on the course of events, but also a perplexing conflict over who said what to whom.

His ally Nigel Adams has also thought to have formally declared intention to step down as an MP to kick start a by-election process, though no word yet on fellow Nadine Dorries. The quitting MPs will be appointed to Steward and Bailiffs of the Chiltern Hundreds or the Manor of Northstead as part of a Commons tradition while waiting for byelections to be held.                      Humza Yousaf rejects calls to suspend Nicola Sturgeon from SNP following her arrest                    Meanwhile, Humza Yousaf  has said he “sees no reason” to suspend Nicola Sturgeon  from the SNP  following her arrest on Sunday. The former first minister was interviewed as a suspect for almost seven hours by detectivesinvestigating allegations of financial misconduct at the Scottish National Party.  After questioning she was released without charge pending further investigation – but a number of figures both within and outside the party have called for her to be suspended. Ms Sturgeon, who stepped down from her role as party and government leader in April, said in a statement on Sunday night that she was “innocent of any wrongdoing”. Asked about the calls to suspend his predecessor, SNP leader Mr Yousaf said he would do “what I believe is right to the values of natural justice”.

If she’s a worthy lifetime peer, I’m a baroness                    To say that Lady Charlotte Owen’s rise to power has been meteoric would be something of an understatement. The 29-year-old, who was awarded Britain’s highest honour in Boris Johnson’s resignation list , has gone from parliamentary intern to baroness in a matter of just six years.  She is currently the youngest person ever  to sit in the House of Lords , but of course there is no expiration date on her new privilege. As a life peer, she will be scrutinising our legislation until she chooses to retire – and judging by the current House of Lords demographic, that’s not likely to be any time in the next half century.                        I’ve monitored Lady Owen’s career with interest, and increasing bafflement. If we’re in the business of enobling 29-year-old York grads with short – and not particularly distinguished – careers in parliament behind them, where’s mine, asks                     Olivia Utley: If Charlotte Owen is a worthy lifetime peer, I’m a baroness                      Sunak ‘forwarded the list unaltered’ -Downing Street                    Downing Street refused to be drawn on Boris Johnson‘s accusation that Rishi Sunak was “talking rubbish” after the Prime Minister accused his predecessor of asking him to overrule the House of Lords Appointments Commission over his nominations for peerages. Asked whether Mr Sunak was talking rubbish, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman told reporters: “You’ve got the words from the PM this morning. “I’m not going to get into more detail. He was very clear he was not prepared to deviate from established convention or do anything unprecedented, which is why, in line with a long-standing custom, he forwarded the list unaltered.”                      ‘He gave a clear answer’, says Downing Street on Sunak statement                    Rishi Sunak does not regret accusing Boris Johnson of asking him to overrule the vetting committee to push through his House of Lords nominations, Downing Street said. Asked whether the prime minister regrets his comments and getting into a public row with his predecessor, his spokesman told reporters: “No. As I say, he was asked a direct question. He gave a clear answer.”                      Johnson and Sunak feud descends into warfare as they trade blows over resignation honours                    The row between Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak today descended into a open warfare as the former PM accused his successor of “talking rubbish” about the resignation honours list saga. Mr Johnson hit back at the prime minister after Mr Sunak accused his one-time ally of asking him to “do something I wasn’t prepared to do” by bending the rules on peerages. In his first public comments since Mr Johnson quit as MP, a defiant Mr Sunak claimed Mr Johnson asked him to either overrule the committee which vets peerages -known as Holac -or “make promises to people” on the issue. Mr Sunak claimed he was “not prepared to do that” because he didn’t think it was “right”. Ramping up his message, he added: “If people don’t like that, then tough.”                        Archie Mitchell reports:                    Boris hits back after Sunak comes out swinging in honours row                      What to know as the falls of Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon roil UK politics                    Two very different British politicians who often clashed, Boris Johnson  and Nicola Sturgeon  both led their parties to great heights — and both have had sudden and dramatic falls. Former U.K. prime minister Johnson quit as a lawmaker rather than face being ousted for lying to Parliament. Sturgeon, the ex-leader of Scotland , was arrested and questioned by police investigating her party’s finances.

In a speech to a conference in London, Gillian Keegan said cutting taxes without ensuring “sound money” and “fiscal discipline” was “fairytale economics”. She said: “Whilst lower taxes are at the heart of Conservative economic thinking – Margaret Thatcher  never thought that the way to achieve a low-tax economy was by dramatically increasing public sector debt and borrowing. “She knew that you had to deal with inflation first otherwise every tax cut or spending pledge would simply be eaten by inflation.”                        Christopher McKeon reports:                    Tax cuts without lower inflation is ‘betrayal’ of Thatcher, says minister                      Penny Mordaunt criticises people attacking Parliament ‘for carrying out its work'                    Penny Mordaunt has criticised people attacking Parliament “for carrying out its work”. The cabinet minister told the Centre for Policy Studies’ Margaret Thatcher conference: “We have to be really strong about people who are attacking institutions, people who are attacking the House for carrying out its work, people who are attacking the media.” She added: “The price of not doing so is going to be very great indeed.” Her comments come after Boris Johnson and several other Conservatives attacked the Privileges Committee investigation into whether the former prime minister misled Parliament over the partygate scandal.                      We’re being softened up for more interest rate rises                    You could bet your mortgage on another interest rate rise at the next meeting of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) next Thursday. Consider the latest intervention by external member Jonathan Haskell, via a column for The Scotsman. He stuck to the script, allowing only that more rate rises “may be necessary”. But take note of his conclusion, which could easily be regarded as a softening-up exercise: “As difficult as our current circumstances are, embedded inflation would be worse.” Haskell’s message is that ‘we know this is hard medicine but the alternative is much worse.’                        The inflation dragon must be slain, says                     James Moore: We’re being softened up for more interest rate rises                      Letters to the editor: Rishi Sunak needs to put an end to the Tory turmoil                    “The Conservative Party is now in more turmoil and chaos than ever before, with no chance of winning the next general election. Rishi Sunak should take this as an opportunity to retrench and consolidate, to expel the far-right fringe and anyone else who refuses to toe his pragmatic and sensible line. The party would, of course, be smaller, but it would be more cohesive and manageable, and would gradually rebuild in strength by welcoming back those disillusioned by the David Cameron, Boris Johnson , and Liz Truss years of lunacy. I shall never vote Tory, but democracy needs a realistic and robust opposition, which I regret we shall not have after the next (hopefullyimminent) general election.” Letters                         to the editor: our readers share their views.

Rishi Sunak needs to put an end to the Tory turmoil                      Reform UK and Reclaim parties announce deal to boost chances in by-elections                    The Reform UK and Reclaim parties have announced a deal to boost each other’s chances in the by-elections triggered by the resignations of Boris Johnson and Nadine Dorries. Actor Laurence Fox, who leads Reclaim, will stand in the Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat vacated by the former prime minister while Reform UK will not stand a candidate there. Dave Holland of Reform, which was founded with Nigel Farage’s backing, will stand in former culture secretary Ms Dorries’ Mid Bedfordshire’s constituency. Mr Fox said: “The Reclaim Party and Reform UK offer the only genuine conservative alternative to the electorate, seeking for a smaller state, lower taxes, control of our borders and a full debate over net zero and the contentious ideologies being forced onto our children in schools.” Reform leader Richard Tice added that “this co-operation enables us to have extra focus on specific by-elections”. Reclaim has one MP after recently welcoming Andrew Bridgen following his expulsion from the Tories for comparing vaccines to the Holocaust.                      Boris hits back after Sunak comes out swinging in honours row                    The row between Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak intensified today as the former PM accused his successor of “talking rubbish” over a claim he was asked to bend the rules on peerages. Mr Johnson lashed out after Mr Sunak said he had been asked to “do something I was not prepared to”  by bending the rules for his resignation honours list. The prime minister  claimed Mr Johnson asked him to either overrule the committee which vets peerages -known as Holac -or “make promises to people” on the issue. But a furious Mr Johnson hit back, saying: “Rishi Sunak is talking rubbish. He added: “To honour these peerages it was not necessary to overrule Holac -but simply to ask them to renew their vetting, which was a mere formality.”                        My colleague Archie Mitchell has the full story:                    Boris hits back after Sunak comes out swinging in honours row                      Sunak ‘talking rubbish’, says Johnson                    Boris Johnson has accused Rishi Sunak of “talking rubbish” after the prime minister said his predecessor asked him to overrule the vetting committee for appointments to the House of Lords. In a statement, Boris Johnson said: “Rishi Sunak is talking rubbish. To honour these peerages it was not necessary to overrule Holac -but simply to ask them to renew their vetting, which was a mere formality.” It comes after Downing Street said it is “entirely untrue” that Mr Sunak or members of his No 10 team removed names from the House of Lords Appointments Commission (Holac) list.                      Johnson ‘a partial architect of his own demise’, says Conservative peer                    Conservative peer Lord Marland offered a staunch defence of Boris Johnson, as he questioned the work of the Privileges Committee. “Boris resigned because he was offended by the fact they didn’t believe him,” Lord Marland told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme. He rejected the point that it was a Conservative-majority committee that was investigating the former prime minister. “There is a lot of difference of views and personal jealousy within the Conservative Party, as there is within the Labour Party. “In some ways, you’re better coming up in front of an entirely Labour group than a mixture.” Lord Marland added: “Who would be prime minister? There has not been a prime minister since Margaret Thatcher who has not left office vilified.” He admitted that Mr Johnson was “a partial architect of his own demise”, but added: “Other people have conspired to help that.”                      Establishment ‘has seen Boris out the door’, says Jake Berry                    Former Tory chairman Jake Berry, a friend of Boris Johnson, told reporters: “The establishment has seen Boris out the door.” Berry said he had “no idea” about private conversations between Johnson and Sunak, and whether the former PM had been promised his honours list. Asked if he would like to see Boris back in the Commons one day, Berry said: “He appeals to the great British public more than I’ve seen an British politician do. There is something special about him. He’s an extraordinary character.” But the senior Tory MP added: “I look forward to campaigning with my friend Rishi – not just in three byelections but in a general election.”                      Boris ally claims Sunak blocked ‘eight people’ from peerages                    Lord Marland suggested on BBC Radio 4’s World at One that Rishi Sunak is to blame for blocking some of Boris Johnson’s resignation honours. The Johnson ally said that there were “eight people who Rishi decided not to support” for peerages. Put to him that the House of Lords appointments commission [Holac] had removed the names, he said: “No, they didn’t. They had the names removed on the suggestion of elements of the civil service, the Cabinet Office or the Inland Revenue [as is] often the case, and then Holac don’t have to adjudicate.” He added: “It is in the remit of the prime minister that, if he really wants someone to become a prime minister, he can push hard for Holac to do with, as various prime ministers have done in the past.” No 10 has rejected the claims from the Boris campaign. “The prime minister then accepted Holac’s approved list and forwarded it unamended to the sovereign for their approval.”                      Blow for British businesses as EU rules out renegotiating Brexit trade deal for years                    The EU ‘s Brexit  chief has ruled out renegotiating Britain’s trade deal until 2026, dashing hopes it could be improved and prevent businesses fleeing the UK. Maroš ŠefÄoviÄ said the trade and cooperation agreement had only been in force for two years and was not yet being used to its full potential. The deal, signed by Boris Johnson  on 30 December 2020, has been criticised by business groups for increasing costs and bureaucracy compared to membership of the EU single market and customs union. “We have received quite a lot of questions and I’ve seen that there is increased interest in the TCA review. As far as our calendar goes, I think that it’s more for 2026,” Mr ŠefÄoviÄ told the EU-UK forum on Monday. He added that he did not want to put the deal “in the shredder”.                        Our Policy Correspondent Jon Stone has the full story:                    Blow for British businesses as EU rules out renegotiating Brexit trade deal for years                      Selby & Ainsty by-election: Key numbers                    Elsewhere, the seat of Selby & Ainsty was created at the 2010 general election and has always been held by the Conservatives. Nigel Adams took 49% of the vote in 2010 and pushed up his share at every subsequent election, winning 53% in 2015, 59% in 2017 and 60% in 2019, when he won a majority of 20,137. Labour came second in 2019 with 25% of the vote, 35 percentage points behind the Tories. The Liberal Democrats finished third with 9%, while the Greens came fifth -behind the Yorkshire Party -on 3%. For Labour to win this North Yorkshire seat at a by-election, it would need a swing in the share of the vote of 17.9 points, or 18 in every 100 people who voted Tory in 2019 to switch to them. The last time Labour achieved a swing at a by-election of at least 17 points was in February 1997, when the party won Wirral South from the Conservatives. The Lib Dems would need a swing of 25.9 points, or 26 in every 100 former Tory voters to switch to them.                      Mid-Bedfordshire by-election: Key numbers                    Meanwhile, Labour would need a much larger swing in Mid-Bedfordshire to win the seat from the Conservatives. Nadine Dorries notched up a huge majority of 24,664 at the 2019 general election, along with 60% of the vote. The constituency has been held by the Tories without a break since 1931, with Ms Dorries becoming its MP in 2005. Labour finished in second place in 2019 on 22% of the vote, 38 percentage points behind the Conservatives. The Lib Dems were further behind on 13%, while the Greens were fourth on 4%. To win the seat at the by-election, Labour would need a swing in the share of the vote of 19.1 percentage points -that is, 20 in every 100 people who voted Conservative in 2019 would have to switch. Labour has not achieved this size of swing in a by-election since winning South East Staffordshire from the Tories in April 1996. The Liberal Democrats would need an even bigger swing to leap from third to first place in Mid-Bedfordshire: 23.6 points, the equivalent of 24 in every 100 people who voted Tory in 2019 switching directly to the Lib Dems. The party has pulled off this kind of swing in recent by-elections, however. In June 2022 the Lib Dems won Tiverton & Honiton from the Conservatives on a swing of 29.9 points, while in December 2021 they won North Shropshire from the Tories on an even bigger swing of 34.1 points.
