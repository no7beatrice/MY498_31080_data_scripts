   Unforgivable damage done by Johnson and the Tories; YOUR LETTERS Sunday Mercury June 18, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Trinity Mirror plc All Rights Reserved Section: WEEKEND;NEWS; Pg. 6 Length: 187 words Body   SO at last we are rid of the cheap chancer. Boris Johnson's exit was as squalid as his lies, not just on Partygate but on the disaster of Brexit. Even Farage now admits Brexit's a 'failure.' . But there were those in the Tory Party who knew Johnson was not fit to be Prime Minister and knew Brexit was going to damage the UK economy. In late 2018 the Treasury report 'EU Exit long-term economic analysis' stated that the UK GDP would lose 4.9% with the hard Brexit that Johnson ended up with. They predicted the loss of free movement would result in a further loss of 1.8%. The OBR still predicts a 4% loss and a year ago the Centre for European Reform considered the loss to be already 5.5%. Some of the more honourable MPs in the Tory Party objected to Johnson's negotiations and we're summarily dismissed from the Parliamentary party. Others sat tight, sheepishly supporting Johnson's hard Brexit, caring first for their own jobs and second for the country. The disdain in which we hold Johnson must also be directed at the Tory Party which supported him. We cannot forgive the damage that has been done.
