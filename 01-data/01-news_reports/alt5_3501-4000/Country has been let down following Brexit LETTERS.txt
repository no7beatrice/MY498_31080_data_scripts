   Country has been let down following Brexit; LETTERS Sunday Express June 4, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Express Newspapers All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 57 Length: 90 words Body   You know that Brexit is not going well when even Nigel Farage says it is has failed ("Let's stop bashing Brexit...blame the Westminster elite", May 21). That is not to say it has been a disaster but the Tory Government, given a large majority, mainly on the back of getting Brexit done, has comprehensively let the country down. None of the political parties wanted Brexit in the first place, so they have let theWhitehall blob dictate the agenda. That is democracy in this country today and it's utterly disgraceful.
