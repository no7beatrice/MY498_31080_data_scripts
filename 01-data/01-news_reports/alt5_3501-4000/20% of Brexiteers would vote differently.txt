   20% of Brexiteers would vote differently The Huddersfield Daily Examiner June 24, 2023 Saturday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 3 Length: 185 words Body   AT least 20% of Brexit supporters would vote differently if they were asked now, a poll of hundreds of people on BBC Question Time has found. Audience members were quizzed on whether Brexit was the right thing to do, with the results showing 70% still agreed, 20% would vote differently while 10% were unsure. The poll was carried out as part of a special episode in which the audience was made up solely of Leave voters. It was recorded in Clacton-on-sea, Essex, on the eve of the seventh anniversary of the EU referendum on June 23. The Tendring area of Essex - which includes Clacton - had one of the highest leave votes in England in the 2016 referendum, with almost 70% voting for Brexit. One audience member, who admitted he would vote differently now, said: "I don't see any benefit from it all", while another blamed the efforts of politicians to "frustrate" the process and said: "We haven't started Brexit yet." The questions included the impact of Brexit on the cost of living, the benefits and downsides of Brexit and what Conservatives and Labour should offer as a Brexit strategy for the next election.
