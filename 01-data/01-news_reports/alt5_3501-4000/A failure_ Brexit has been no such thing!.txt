   A failure? Brexit has been no such thing! Metro (UK) September 22, 2023 Friday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: FEATURES; Pg. 13 Length: 161 words Body   ¦ On and on it goes, day after day, the Britain-haters sling in their anti-Brexit rants to Metro. Thursday's MetroTalk featured Richard Wilson of Leeds For Europe claiming Brexit has failed. It has done nothing of the sort. If you want to see economic failure, take a look at Germany. If Brexit has been a failure, why is the pound so strong? And the so-called economic cliff-face Britain was supposed to fall off- what happened to that? Wilson claims thousands of his Remoaner friends will beat some silly march in London tomorrow. I, along with everyone else, will be ignoring it. Nick Rougier, Essex ¦ Yet another diehard Remainer alleging Brexit has failed. But still nothing from him, or any of them, about the likely cost and the sacrifices the UK would be expected to make to rejoin, as he wishes. Given the cold hard facts around rejoining, I believe the majority of the electorate would accept that we are where we are and will make the best of it.
