   'BANG BREXIT DRUM' The Sun (England) July 30, 2023 Sunday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 2 Length: 122 words Byline: SOPHIA SLEIGH Body   TORY peer David Frost has told Rishi Sunak to bang the drum for Brexit - or risk losing the next election. Lord Frost, who negotiated Britain's exit from the EU, warned the PM the Government will "pay the price" if it does not hail Brexit successes. The peer, left - who quit the Government over high taxes and Covid restrictions - said: "We need to talk about Brexit more. Voters rightly see leaving the EU as a Conservative Party project. "If we don't talk up the successes and the future prospects no one will." Lord Frost told the party's North East conference in Newcastle yesterday: "If voters come to believe 'Brexit is failing' it's this government that will pay the price."
