   EXCLUSIVE Holiday chaos fear over EU 'big brother' visas that could see massive queues... And it's stubborn Brussels bureaucracy that's holding things up MailOnline July 29, 2023 Saturday 10:14 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:2 Length: 2196 words Byline: Abul Taher Glen Owen Body   Under post-Brexit requirements, UK citizens' fingerprints and face scan taken Also have to provide personal information like health conditions and itinerary British travellers face maddening queues when they visit continental Europe next year thanks to a new 'Big Brother' entry system being imposed by Brussels, MPs have warned. Under the strict post-Brexit requirements, UK citizens will be fingerprinted and have their faces scanned before being allowed to enter EU countries.  They will also have to provide detailed personal information in advance - including health conditions and planned itineraries - before being granted a travel permit. Last night, bosses at Britain's busiest ferry and rail ports warned that the expected delays of cars and lorries could cause hundreds of millions of pounds of damage to the economy, while British holidaymakers will face long queues at European airports as they line up to submit their information.  Privacy groups have also objected to European authorities holding personal data. The plans - which could be seen as Brussels taking 'revenge' for Brexit - are due to be introduced by next summer, although the EU is facing calls for them to be delayed until after the Paris Olympics in July and August to limit the chaos. The EU Entry-Exit System (EES) which will apply to travellers from the UK and other non-EU countries, will allow Brussels to check whether British travellers are exceeding their post-Brexit restriction of 90 days' stay in any 180-day period - a rule currently enforced by border guards checking passport stamps.

Visitors will be charged (EURO)7 (about £6) and have to supply detailed personal information online including their name, address, state of health, criminal records, purpose of travel and the address of the first night's stay. UK travellers will be forced to hand over such intimate data despite possessing British biometric passports, with decisions about whether to award the permit expected to take anywhere between a few minutes to 30 days. Since Brexit, British travellers to the EU have been classified as 'third country' citizens, triggering extra red tape.  If rejected, applicants are likely to be asked to attend an interview at a consulate of the first country they intend to visit. The permit will be valid for three years, or until the traveller's passport runs out. MPs fear the longest queues will be at the ferry port of Dover, the Channel Tunnel terminal in Folkestone and the Eurostar terminal in St Pancras station in London. Eurostar has warned that at peak times, 80 per cent of its passengers would have to be processed through the system, requiring the installation of 25 new self-service kiosks in a confined space to allow passengers to submit their fingerprints and have their facial image taken.  But officials fear there could still be queues, with passengers missing trains, and hours of departure delays being caused each day. Getlink, the company which runs the Eurotunnel, is scrambling to build a massive hangar at the Folkestone terminal which will allow up to 70 cars to park while passengers submit their biometric data to French police.  Another hangar is being built at Calais Frethun, at a total cost of nearly £100 million. Last night, Natalie Elphicke, the Tory MP for Dover, said: 'The new European checks will soon be upon us. There needs to be an urgent plan to avoid chaos at the border when the new checks come in.' David Jones, the Tory MP for Clwyd West, who sits on the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, blamed the EU for the impending chaos, saying Brussels should allow Britons to submit their biometric data ahead of travel and have it verified at special offices across British cities, which could be manned by French border police. Mr Jones said: 'This could prevent the queues at the ports. But the European Commission will have to bring legislative change for that. And it is the most intransigent bureaucracy in the world.'                      Database mired in controversy                    By Abul Taher Security Correspondent An obscure EU bureaucrat will oversee the controversial plan to store biometric and personal data of tens of millions of Britons in a giant database. In March, Agnes Diallo became the chief executive of eu-Lisa, the European Union Agency for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. This little-known agency will store the data of Britons who apply for the Entry/Exit System visa waiver (EES). From its HQ in the Estonian capital Tallinn, Ms Diallo will run one of the largest databases in the EU. However, European media has reported on how her appointment has been dogged with controversy.  The Harvard-educated Parisian worked at the French IT firm Atos between 2016 and 2019 in a number of senior roles. But there have been accusations of a conflict of interest thanks to the cosy relationship between Atos and the EU because the EES IT infrastructure is being partly created by Atos itself. For two decades, Atos has reportedly been one of the main recipients of EU IT contracts.  In 2019, the firm won the £122 million contract to develop the EES system in conjunction with its rivals IBM and Leonardo. When Ms Diallo went for the eu-Lisa job, MEPs refused to vote for her because she had worked for Atos. Instead, they appointed a rival.  But the eu-Lisa administrative board overturned their decision and gave the post to Ms Diallo. The EES database will soon merge with the £380 million Interoperability Project digital storage scheme - overseen by Ms Diallo and, again, partly set up by Atos. Tory MP Bill Cash, who chairs the committee, said: 'We have heard evidence that there will be queues if nothing is done. I urge all parties, the Government, the French government and the European Commission to find remedies and bring about the changes.' Under EU legislation, the biometric data of Britons and citizens of other non-EU countries will be stored in a giant database, which can be accessed by all 27 member states, as well as bodies like Europol, the European border agency Frontex, and UN agencies, as well as NGOs such as the International Organisation for Migration and the Red Cross. The aim is to identify individuals suspected of being involved in terrorism, armed robbery, child pornography, or money laundering.  But Dr Ilia Siatitsa, a senior legal officer for Privacy International, warned that the database could be hacked and biometric data leaked online for criminal gangs to use.  She said: 'Any leak of this data, and it's not like changing your passport. You can't go and change your fingerprint or your face.' Dr Siatitsa raised fears the move was a Big Brother measure, saying that for the EU to grant a visa waiver, it does not need to extract passengers' biometric data, as the information on their passport is enough.  She warned: 'Once data is collected, it can be repurposed, and its uses widened. This has happened in the past.' The system will apply when entering every EU country except Cyprus and Ireland. You will also be allowed to enter Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, which are part of the border-free Schengen area. More than 11 million passengers use the port of Dover each year, another 10 million use LeShuttle through the Channel Tunnel and the same number use the Eurostar.  Eurostar has already cancelled its direct service from St Pancras to the French Alps, as bosses fear the new inspections combined with passengers checking in skiing equipment will make the queues too long. They have also cancelled the direct service from St Pancras to Disneyland Paris, as checks for families with small children are likely to be slow, too. But the problem is most acute at Dover, which is sandwiched between the city's famous white cliffs and the sea, so it has no extra space to expand with a Folkestone-style hangar. Officials there are instead hoping that a deal can be brokered by the British and French governments and the European Commission to allow passenger biometric data to be submitted and verified in advance. Richard Christian, a spokesman for the Port of Dover said: 'We are very space-constrained If we don't have the regulation changed, then it will be a lot more difficult for us to be able to deal with the process... it will make it lot slower.' John Keefe, from Getlink, said the system had been designed with airports in mind, when passengers walk into a terminal on foot, not terminuses where passengers are in cars and have to leave their vehicles to deal with the red tape. Last night, a Home Office spokesperson said: 'We understand the concerns of British travellers and the sector around the EU's new travel requirements and we are liaising closely with European partners to ensure their plans do not cause unnecessary delays for Britons travelling abroad.  'We are also working with the French Government, port authorities and operators to ensure there is minimal disruption.'                      How you'll need fingerprints and a facial portrait to clear checkpoints                     BY ABUL TAHER What is the EU Entry-Exit System?  Britain got 'third country' status as a result of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, meaning strict controls for Britons on entry and exit to the EU.  The EU's Entry-Exit System (EES) will monitor all non-EU travellers entering the Schengen Area - 27 countries that do not carry out checks at their internal borders - and will require non-EU citizens to register a digital identification profile at checkpoints and undergo a biometric check.  The EES acts as a visa waiver programme that requires all Britons to sign up if they wish to enter the European Union for short stays of up to 90 days in any 180 days.  How will travellers get the EES permit?  It is expected that Britons will be able to apply for the long-delayed permit via a website or a phone app, but neither has yet been devised.  Those who do not apply online should be able to obtain the document at a port of entry - though there may be huge wait times. The cost will be about £6, though free for those under 18 and over 70.  The EU hopes that travellers will be able to use an app on their smartphone to submit scans of their face and fingerprints before they travel.  There will also be terminals in airports and other border points where passengers can scan their face on a screen and copy their fingerprints by placing their hand on a digital tablet device similar to an iPad. Travellers will also have to fill in a form with personal information such as health details and their planned itinerary.  The EES will remain valid for three years after a passenger's last exit from an EU country, or until the expiry of their passport, whichever comes first.  What is the technology behind it? A consortium led by French firm Atos is creating the IT infrastructure for facial images and fingerprinting.  An EU technical report said that scans of the iris in the eye were considered but abandoned as the electronic security gates at borders cannot yet deal with this method of biometric identification, which takes images of the unique patterns in the eye. But it added that this may be used in the future. What will be the process at ports? If an app or a web portal is ready for use next year, passengers would be able to submit their details as well as a facial image and fingerprints ahead of travel. Then, at an airport immigration desk, it would be verified.  Any passenger who does not submit data online would be allowed to use kiosks at airports before approaching the immigration desk.  In ferry and Eurotunnel ports, where passengers are in cars, the process would be difficult and time-consuming as they will have to get out of their cars to submit data.  The Port of Dover says it will have to create new infrastructure to handle the border checks.  What will happen to my personal data?  Everyone's biometric and personal data will be stored in a giant EU database, which, in turn, is part of another storage system called the Interoperability Project.  Your details could be accessed by EU governments, agencies such as Europol, Frontex and even UN bodies - for investigative and law enforcement purposes - as well as by organisations such as the Red Cross.  What controls will we have over the use of our personal data?  Brussels says it guarantees that it will not go to governments and agencies not specified in the legislation.  The data will be destroyed three years after your last exit from an EU country.  What other countries are affected?  Britain is among 59 other nonEU countries and territories whose citizens will require the EES - alongside the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  But citizens of other nations, such as Russia, will have to obtain a Schengen visa first to enter the EU. Load-Date: July 30, 2023  End of Document
