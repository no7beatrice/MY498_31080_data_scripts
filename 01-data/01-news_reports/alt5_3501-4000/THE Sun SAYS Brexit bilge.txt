   THE Sun SAYS Brexit bilge The Sun (England) June 9, 2023 Friday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 10 Length: 131 words Body   THE Remainer establishment will waste no chance to trash Brexit. Incredibly, even the Covid inquiry is limbering up to do so. It intends to ask witnesses how preparing to leave the EU damaged our readiness for a pandemic. Really? The scandalous incompetence and smug complacency of Public Health England was Brexit's fault? The years it wasted obsessing about our diets and baying for nanny state taxes were Brexit's fault? PHE itself didn't think Brexit was a problem when in February 2020 it assured the nation it was ready for anything (Spoiler: It wasn't). What Brexit DID do was let us roll out the jabs first. We were still officially under EU rules ? but went our own way because we knew we were leaving. Will the inquiry credit Brexit with saving countless lives? We won't hold our breath.
