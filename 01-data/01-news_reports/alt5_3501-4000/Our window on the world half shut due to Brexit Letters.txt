   Our window on the world half shut due to Brexit; Letters Scottish Express May 31, 2024 Friday Edition 1, Scotland  Copyright 2024 Express Newspapers All Rights Reserved Section: LETTERS; Pg. 51 Length: 158 words Body   IT was with no sense of irony that Scottish Labour leaderAnas Sarwar said that, under a UK Government, the Scotland Office would be "Scotland's window on the world". Talk of promoting international links is all well and good, but this is from a party intent on continuing to limit access to our key markets through backing Brexit. Brexit has been disastrous for our businesses and consumers, limiting economic growth and restricting trade. Recent border controls will cost business £2billion, with the Scottish salmon industry alone suffering an extra £12million costs. Last year, almost half of businesses (44%) named Brexit as the main cause of difficulties trading overseas. Across every sector of our economy, it has added costs, limited access to workers and cut markets. Labour's ambitions may be to make the Scotland Office our window to the world, but that window is currently half-closed due to the devastating impact of Brexit.
