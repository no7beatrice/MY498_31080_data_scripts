   Rewards of Brexit The Times (London) June 27, 2023 Tuesday Edition 1, Ireland  Copyright 2023 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 26 Length: 144 words Body   Sir, Mark Littlewood bemoans the inability of successive Brexit-oriented British governments to exploit the "freedoms" that Brexit should have ushered in ("We are still waiting to reap the rewards of Brexit, and this is why", business comment, Jun 26). Not once does he attempt to balance the argument by explaining the myriad benefits and freedoms lost to Britons by Brexit - prominent among these being the freedom to live, work and study in 27 EU countries and the freedom to trade without barriers. Michael Clancy Melbourne, Derbyshire Sir, Mark Littlewood tries to explain away the difficulties that Britain has experienced in trying to make a success of Brexit while making no reference to the two key words that sum up why Brexit was always going to be messy and could never be "done" properly. Those two words are Northern Ireland. Graham Davies Bogota, Colombia Load-Date: June 27, 2023  End of Document
