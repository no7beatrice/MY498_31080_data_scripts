   The secretive guru who plotted Keir Starmer’s path to power with undeclared cash thetimes.co.uk November 12, 2023 Sunday 12:01 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 3845 words Byline: Gabriel Pogrund and Harry Yorke Highlight: Morgan McSweeney, 46, spent much of Jeremy Corbyn’s reign researching how moderates might regain control of Labour and turn it into a party of government — but failed to declare donations that paid for it Body    Keir Starmer’s chief aide, ran a secretive group which played a “key role” in the Labour leader’s election  Morgan McSweeney failed to declare £730,000 in donations to Labour Together, made by millionaire venture capitalists and businessmen, between 2017 and 2020 and misreported and underreported other payments  In a January 2019 meeting in Westminster, he assured senior MPs that donations were being disclosed as required by law. This was not the case.  In 2021, the Electoral Commission launched an investigation. Labour Together’s lawyers blamed “human error” - and did not mention McSweeney  The group was fined, found guilty of more than 20 separate breaches of the law and told it had not given a reasonable excuse  McSweeney was never publicly linked to the scandal and is now in charge of Labour’s preparations for the general election During the dog days of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership a little known figure within Westminster approached Keir Starmer, then shadow Brexit secretary, with a proposal. “When this is over, we need to rebuild the party. I think you might be the man to do it,” the conversation in the summer of 2019 is said to have gone. The proposer was Morgan McSweeney, who ran a secretive group called Labour Together. McSweeney had spent much of Corbyn’s reign conducting research on how to regain control of the party for the moderates and, in his eyes, turn it into a party of government again. Given the factionalism of the Corbyn era, Labour Together operated under the radar. Supported by moderates such as Rachel Reeves and Wes Streeting, for several years it did not even have a Twitter account or website. It conducted clandestine research and polling on Labour’s half a million members which might one day be useful to a moderate leadership candidate. For McSweeney that person increasingly appeared to be Starmer, who already had a high profile among the party’s grassroots. What followed was one of the most successful political alliances in recent party history. In the leadership contest after Corbyn’s 2019 general election defeat, Starmer appointed McSweeney his campaign manager. Today, Starmer, 61, is consistently ahead in the polls and appears destined for Downing Street. McSweeney, 46, is in charge of the party’s general election campaign and remains his closest adviser. Labour Together has emerged from the shadows as the party’s “policy shop” generating the ideas to populate the next manifesto. There is also a parallel story. McSweeney failed to declare the hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations he used to pull off his mission. The money, provided by millionaire venture capitalists and businessmen between 2017 and 2020, amounted to £730,000. He understated and misreported other payments. For much of this period, Labour Together’s website claimed its donations were reported to the Electoral Commission, as required by law. In January 2019, the group held a meeting in parliament where MPs asked McSweeney if donations were being declared fully and promptly. He said they were. This was not the case. When the Electoral Commission launched an investigation, in 2021, McSweeney was working for Starmer. His name did not appear in Labour Together’s response to the watchdog. That blamed the failings on an “admin error”. The regulator said the group had not provided a reasonable excuse, found more than 20 offences under electoral law and issued a fine. McSweeney was never linked to the failings. By then, money at a scale rarely seen in Labour politics had already changed the party’s future, setting Starmer on the path to Downing Street. Up and running Labour Together was set up as a company in June 2015, weeks after Ed Miliband resigned as party leader after losing the general election to David Cameron. Its founder was John Clarke, an Irish citizen married to an influential moderate councillor in Islington, north London. Clarke had previously served as director of Blue Labour, a group that advocated a blend of left-wing economics and social conservatism as the party’s path back to power. Less than a year after setting up Labour Together, Clarke resigned, giving way to three MPs who had served on Miliband’s front bench. The first was Jon Cruddas, a central Blue Labour figure. He had fought the British National Party (BNP) in his Dagenham constituency and believed Labour had to become the party of ordinary patriotic people, not metropolitan Britain. He was joined by Lisa Nandy, the Wigan MP, and Steve Reed, who, before becoming Croydon North MP, led Lambeth council, transforming it from a Trotskyist redoubt of the “loony left” into an award-winning borough with a strong emphasis on public services. More passionate about the stuff of local government — bin collections, housing, potholes — than economic ideology or foreign policy, the three were united in their desire to reconnect the party with working Britain. Their mission appeared even more critical after the shock of September 2015 when Corbyn was elected party leader by 250,000 people, many of them trade union members or “registered supporters” who paid £3 to gain a vote. To get up and running, the MPs needed funding. They approached Martin Taylor, a Mayfair-based hedge fund manager who, at 46, had just announced his retirement. Taylor made his fortune as founder of Nevsky Capital — a £1.5bn fund launched in the Cayman Islands known for investing in Russian companies such as Gazprom. A month after Corbyn’s election, he gave Labour Together an initial donation of £40,000, followed by payments taking his contribution above six figures. Also committing money was Trevor Chinn, 88, a Jewish community leader, Labour donor and friend of Tony Blair, knighted for his services to Great Ormond Street in the 1990s. Chinn had made his money in the car industry after inheriting his father’s network of garages and acquiring the Royal Automobile Club (RAC). He later headed into venture capital before retiring and dedicating himself to philanthropy on progressive causes in Britain and Israel. No stranger to being a target of antisemitism, in 2008 he had appeared on an Al Qaeda hitlist in a landmark terrorism trial. Chinn donated £10,000 and was appointed director. Over the next year, the group served as a safe space for soft-left MPs traumatised by Miliband’s defeat, Corbyn’s victory and Brexit. Its members met in parliament and at the House of St Barnabas, a private members’ club in Soho. Testing ground In the summer of 2017, McSweeney was appointed Labour Together’s full-time director — reporting to a board including Reed, Nandy, Cruddas and Chinn. McSweeney had had an unorthodox route into Labour politics. He grew up in Macroom, a small town in Co Cork, southwest Ireland. His father, Tim, was an accountant and mascot of the local Gaelic football team; his mother, Carmel, a keen bridge player. Aged 17, he had migrated to London, where he worked on building sites and later enrolled to study politics and marketing at Middlesex University. His family was not traditionally left-wing — his aunt was a councillor for Fine Gael, the centre-right party — but in 1997, inspired by the Good Friday Agreement, he joined the Labour Party. After working as a receptionist at party headquarters, by 2001 he had moved to its attack and rebuttal unit in Millbank, Westminster. His tasks included inputting data into Peter Mandelson’s “Excalibur”, a computer that could instantly search thousands of quotes and facts and help provide instant responses to Tory attacks. He soon pivoted into campaigns, working with two of the MPs who later created Labour Together. The first was Reed. In 2006, McSweeney helped him defy disaffection with Labour over Iraq and win Lambeth council back from no overall control. McSweeney felt the hard left had not only cost Labour power; their perceived obsession with opposing the Tories distracted them to the point that basic services were ignored. While running Reed’s campaign, McSweeney himself failed as a council candidate in nearby Sutton, winning just 149 votes. In 2008, he had another formative experience. He went to Dagenham in east London where Labour was facing an insurgent BNP, which under Nick Griffin had won a dozen council seats and was targeting MPs like Cruddas and Margaret Hodge. McSweeney worked closely with Cruddas and David Evans, a Blair official who later became Starmer’s general secretary, to focus their campaigning efforts on patriotism and crime. It culminated with the “Battle of Barking”, when Labour routed the BNP at the 2010 general election. “He was the real unsung hero of the whole thing,” Cruddas later told the New Statesman. “It got pretty tasty, but Morgan was key in terms of organising discipline, sorting out communications and systematically analysing the voters.” In September 2015 McSweeney ran the leadership campaign of Blairite Liz Kendall, who came last in the contest with 4% of the vote. After a period in local government, he joined Labour Together in 2017. He became its first full-time director and also served as company secretary, the person traditionally responsible for a company’s day-to-day administration, including compliance with regulations. By this point, Corbyn had been in office for almost two years and appeared more powerful than ever. The left had full control of the party machinery, making his removal through a vote or rule change all but impossible. Instead of trying to oust him, Labour Together focused on high-quality polling and research to gain an insight into Labour’s large, but poorly understood, membership. Despite the hard-left caricature, McSweeney believed the reality of Corbyn-era Labour was more subtle: that many of those who had voted for Corbyn were well-meaning public sector workers, trade union members and progressives who had lost faith after Iraq. He thought it would be possible to peel these members — the “soft left” — away from the more factional “hard left” and unite them with centrist members behind a single candidate when the time came to elect Corbyn’s successor. McSweeney needed to understand who they were, what they wanted, and what kind of language appealed to them. Then he could identify a leader they would be prepared to back. He got to work creating four projects. Each began with the phrase: “what do Labour members think about…” followed by, in turn, “the economy”, “work”, “belonging” and “power”. Donations questioned McSweeney also turned his eye to fundraising. In his first few months he raised tens of thousands from Taylor and Chinn. McSweeney reported these contributions to the Electoral Commission, just as his predecessors had done. As a group of party members, Labour Together was a regulated entity and required to disclose all donations within 30 days. Failure to do so, or to file reports correctly, is an offence potentially leading to civil and in certain cases criminal proceedings. Such laws are based on the idea that the public has the right to know who is paying money to influence public life. Yet in December 2017, McSweeney stopped reporting donations to the watchdog. That month, Taylor gave his biggest sum to date: the first of several lots of £50,000. Chinn made the first of several lots of £12,500. Labour Together was starting to raise money on a scale and at a speed rarely seen in British politics. Yet to an outsider, it would have seemed donors, whose money had previously always appeared on the Electoral Commission’s database, had stopped giving. The omissions were not a one-off. In early 2018, more wealthy businessmen started opening their wallets. Many had given to Smith’s leadership challenge to Corbyn the previous year. Lord Myners, a City grandee and former minister under Gordon Brown, made a donation of £25,000. Lord Hollick, a Labour-supporting banking and media tycoon; Simon Tuttle, a private equity executive involved with the campaign group Hope Not Hate; and Sean Wadsworth, owner of a communications firm, all gave £10,000 each. Richard Greer, another donor to Miliband, gave the same. In January 2019, McSweeney hosted a meeting of Labour Together MPs in Portcullis House, Westminster, to discuss the relaunch of the group’s website and the publication of a series of articles. The site was going to say: “You can find out more about our donations on the Electoral Commission’s website here.” According to a source, Shabana Mahmood, the Birmingham Ladywood MP, now shadow justice secretary, asked if donors had been forewarned they might face questions. McSweeney said they had. Another MP asked if donations were being declared as required by law. In the words of a source, the MP wanted to check if the group was up to date and in line with its obligations. McSweeney assured them that donations were being declared. In fact, the only money he reported over two years was £12,500 from Chinn in August 2018, months after Labour Together stopped reporting funds. Neither McSweeney nor Labour Together will explain this anomaly. In total, McSweeney failed to report more than £700,000 in funds. That easily exceeds the amount which Unite, the biggest single donor to MPs, gave to Labour parliamentarians between the last general election and this year. Yet Labour Together’s project to recapture the party from the left remained under the radar. Enter Starmer Sources say McSweeney and Starmer started speaking over the summer of 2019, when Labour remained split over the issue of Brexit. Starmer had only been in parliament since 2015 — the result of gentle encouragement by Miliband, when leader, and a well-oiled campaign to install the former Director of Public Prosecutions as candidate for Holborn and St Pancras, a London safe seat. Despite resigning as a shadow immigration minister during Owen Smith’s leadership challenge against Corbyn in 2016, Starmer returned to the shadow cabinet weeks later and was rewarded with a promotion. He became shadow Brexit secretary. In September 2018 Starmer endeared himself to the pro-EU grassroots by using a conference speech to raise the idea of a second referendum. He declared: “No one is ruling out Remain as an option.” That line, which drew a spontaneous standing ovation in the conference hall, was met with fury by Corbyn’s office. They viewed it as a deliberate attempt to sabotage their delicately crafted and unpopular fudge: negotiating a left-wing version of Brexit and leaving open the question of a second referendum. What they could see — what allies say McSweeney could see too — was that it also fired the starting gun on a future leadership campaign. Remainers were looking for a like-minded hero and they seized upon Starmer, despite his lawyerly and diffident mien. According to sources, McSweeney and Starmer’s initial conversations were informal. The pair agreed that, when the time was right, they might work together. McSweeney had the research and the ideas. He also had the money; Labour Together banked £45,000 after his arrival in 2017, £190,000 in 2018 and £295,992 in 2019. The opportunity came in December 2019, when Corbyn led Labour to its worst defeat in almost a century. On January 5, Starmer launched his leadership bid. Three days later, it was revealed that he had appointed McSweeney as campaign manager. He was able to help Starmer in three distinct ways. The first was his knowledge of the Parliamentary Labour Party, vital for gathering the signatures required to become a candidate. Starmer secured the support of 22 MPs before any of his rivals: by no means a foregone conclusion for the relative Westminster newcomer. The second and most significant was his knowledge of the party’s members, the result of Labour Together’s years of detailed research. McSweeney helped Starmer deliver a pitch-perfect campaign which captured the soft left’s imagination by combining idealism with a professionalism that Corbyn had lacked. His launch video saw him rhapsodising about his work for trade unions and pitching himself as the candidate of miners, poll tax protesters and striking print workers. Yet unlike Corbyn, he assured members, he could give effect to those values by actually winning. Lastly, McSweeney brought in money. Not only did Labour Together raise £160,000 for its own use during the contest, none of it declared, its supporters also donated to Starmer: Taylor (£95,000), Chinn (£50,000), Hollick (£50,000) and Myners (£10,000), amounting to £205,000 or 30% of Starmer’s cash donations during the campaign. Starmer refused to disclose such details at the time, instead staying within the rules but waiting until after his election. Publicly the group claimed not to back any candidate. On 13 February 2020, Mahmood wrote: “Labour Together is not supporting any particular leadership campaign, and the data from our survey is not and will not be shared with any campaign.” It was only after Starmer’s victory that its position changed. It has since published statements which continue to appear on its website such as: “In 2020, Labour Together helped to rally the party membership behind Keir Starmer: the candidate who could bring together a divided party.” It also quotes Reed saying: “In 2020, Labour Together played a key role in Keir Starmer’s leadership campaign.” But in 2020, with Covid raging, these inconsistencies went under the radar. In April, Starmer won the contest with 56% of the vote. He immediately appointed McSweeney as chief of staff, making him the most senior adviser in the Labour Party. McSweeney in turn left his post as director of Labour Together and got to work on his three-step plan to get Starmer elected: reform the party; expose the failings of the Conservatives; and offer a vision for the country. With the country consumed by the pandemic, he quietly executed the first part. His friend, the Blairite David Evans, whom he had worked with in Dagenham, was appointed Labour’s general secretary. His key MP supporters were all rewarded with shadow cabinet posts or other senior roles.  Corbyn was suspended , the Corbynite Scottish leader was forced out, and Corbynite officials were purged. Guilty verdict Now that McSweeney had left, Labour Together continued to operate as a kind of Starmerite think-tank, generating the ideas that would re-energise the centre ground and in due course promote the basis for a Labour manifesto. Its administrator was now Hannah O’Rourke, a former adviser to Miliband’s shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt. In late 2020, she realised that for a period of almost three years, Labour Together had not declared hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Electoral Commission. In December that year, she filed a series of “late” donation reports, with one sum as long as 1,292 days beyond the 30-day limit. Dozens of donations — including over £730,000 when McSweeney was in charge — had never been disclosed at all. She could not provide any explanation. The following month, the Electoral Commission launched an investigation into offences under electoral law. Labour Together quickly retained the services of Gerald Shamash, a solicitor who had represented the Labour Party in moments of crisis ever since the days of Neil Kinnock. McSweeney was consulted over email and the phone. He was asked to explain why donations suddenly stopped being reported and why £12,500 was anomalously disclosed. On 20 February 2021, Shamash sent the watchdog a response. It did not refer to McSweeney’s personal role or even mention him by name. It simply said those involved believed that money was being declared all along and blamed “human error and administrative oversight”. Shamash wrote: “Enquiries have been made of those involved at the material time and frankly it was assumed that donations were being properly reported as indeed they had been so reported up to late 2017 and early 2018.” He added that there was “absolutely no intention. . . to fail to report” and that his client had been as “open and transparent” as possible. He offered to fine-tune the group’s processes and draw a line under the matter. The Electoral Commission rejected this offer. By then, it had evidence of other failings. It not only expanded the number of donations under investigation, but found evidence of disclosures including incorrect information. In June 2017, McSweeney had under-reported a donation from Taylor. The paperwork said the donation was £18,000. In fact, it was £20,000. It had also reported on a donation as “cash”, when it was actually a “non-cash” donation — in effect, a payment made by a donor directly to a third party supplier. Labour Together had also failed to appoint a “responsible person”: a requirement of electoral law giving a person formal responsibility for declaring funds. In September 2021, the watchdog delivered its verdict. It said Labour Together’s claims did not amount to a “reasonable excuse”. It found the organisation had committed more than 20 breaches of the law involving more than £700,000 of donations, and issued a fine of £14,250. A spokesman said this was “towards the high end of [the] scale” and was the largest penalty issued that year bar one. They said: “This reflected the multiple offences committed by Labour Together over a period of three years.” The watchdog can technically issue a fine of £20,000 per offence, which, in this instance, would have exceeded £500,000, although that rarely happens. News of the decision appeared in a single online publication, Business Insider, but was otherwise ignored as the nation focused on Covid. Labour Together said it “proactively raised concerns about its own reporting to the Electoral Commission” and “the outcome [was] made public by the Electoral Commission”. McSweeney did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Today, McSweeney is leading preparations for the next general election. The MPs credited with creating Labour Together — Reeves, shadow chancellor, Streeting, shadow health secretary, Mahmood, shadow justice secretary, Reed, shadow environment secretary, as well as Bridget Phillipson, shadow education secretary, and Lucy Powell, shadow Commons leader, and Lisa Nandy, shadow international development secretary — sit in Starmer’s top team. Labour Together is seen as the incubator of the next manifesto and recently unveiled a star-studded advisory board, including Cambridge professor Helen Thompson, former health secretary Alan Milburn and even pollster Andrew Cooper, who previously worked for David Cameron. This is the first time the story has been told of Starmer’s path to power, the man who got him there, and the undeclared money that allowed Labour Together to transform British politics under the cover of darkness and in breach of the law.                    This investigation is drawn from interviews, analysis of public filings and leaked documents. The Electoral Commission documents were made available by Paul Holden, an investigative journalist whose book, “Keir Starmer, Labour Together, and the Crisis of British Democracy”, is published next year and is the basis of a series of forthcoming articles published by US journalist Matt Taibbi.
