   UK economy worse off today than before Brexit, says Goldman Sachs NAFTA (English) February 14, 2024 Wednesday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC.

This is the opinion of Goldman Sachs, where they state that the British economy has "significantly underperformed" other advanced economies since the referendum held in 2016. As they detail in an analysis, they calculate that the UK grew 5% less in the last eight years than other comparable countries. Although they believe the real hit could range between 4% and 8% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). What are the reasons? At Goldman Sachs they point to three key factors: reduced trade, weaker business investment and labor shortages as a result of lower immigration from the EU. In terms of trade in goods, since the Brexit vote, the UK has underperformed other advanced economies by about 15%. Business investment, meanwhile, has fallen "markedly below" pre-referendum levels. Meanwhile, with respect to immigration, they note that "the post-Brexit shift in flows has reduced labor supply elasticity in the UK, contributing to the post-Brexit rise in inflation and pointing to more cyclical inflationary and labor market pressures in the future."
