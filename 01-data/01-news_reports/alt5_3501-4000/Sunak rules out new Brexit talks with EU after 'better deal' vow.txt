   Sunak rules out new Brexit talks with EU after 'better deal' vow The Courier September 19, 2023 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 DC Thomson Co Ltd All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 19 Length: 192 words Body   Rishi Sunak has ruled out renegotiating the post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union after Sir Keir Starmer vowed to seek a "much better" agreement. Downing Street said yesterday the prime minister would not reopen the trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) brokered with Brussels in "any way, shape or form". The refusal came after the Labour leader pledged to seek a closer trading relationship with the EU if his party wins the next general election as he seeks to "make Brexit work". Sir Keir will be holding talks with French president Emmanuel Macron today, during which post-Brexit relations are expected to feature prominently. The prime minister's official spokesman said: "We're not looking to relitigate the past or reopen it in any way, shape or form." Sir Keir said in the interview: "As we go into 2025 we will attempt to get a much better deal for the UK. I do think we can have a closer trading relationship as well. That's subject to further discussion." A Conservative spokesman said: "Seven years on from the referendum, Keir Starmer wants to take Britain back to square one on Brexit, reopening the arguments of the past all over again."
