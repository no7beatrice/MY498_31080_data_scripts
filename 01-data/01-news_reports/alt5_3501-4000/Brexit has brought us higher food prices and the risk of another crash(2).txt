   Brexit has brought us higher food prices and the risk of another crash Metro (UK) February 5, 2024 Monday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: FEATURES; Pg. 8 Length: 171 words Body   ? So, Rachel Reeves - shadow chancellor and MP here in Yorkshire - says a Labour government won't bring back curbs on the bankers' bonuses that incentivised excessive risk-taking in the lead up to the 2007-8 financial crash (Metro, Thu). The Tories were able to remove that safeguard only because of Brexit. Meanwhile, Conservative minister and Leave propagandist Andrea Leadsom claims that all the extra red tape imposed on firms by Brexit is due to us being 'a sovereign state again'. Rubbish, of course. Staying out of the EU but rejoining the European single market is still too much to ask for, apparently. Oh well, at least already rich bankers in London keep their Brexit bonus. Do our political masters think the rest of us well away from Westminster should just settle for that? Peter Brown, Bradford ? I note with interest Andrea Leadsom's comment that Brexit red tape is the price for being a sovereign state again. In reality this means significantly higher food prices, as we import 50 per cent of our food. Huw, Via Email Load-Date: February 5, 2024  End of Document
