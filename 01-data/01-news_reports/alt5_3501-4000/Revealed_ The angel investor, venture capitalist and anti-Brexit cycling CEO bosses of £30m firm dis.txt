   Revealed: The angel investor, venture capitalist and anti-Brexit cycling CEO bosses of £30m firm distributing material on 'white supremacy' for British school children as young as five MailOnline August 1, 2023 Tuesday 11:00 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:3 Length: 1501 words Byline: Harry Howard Body   Chris Kenyon is the CEO of The Key, a firm with a £30million turnover Non-executive director Samantha Tubb is an angel investor Venture capitalist Ian Armitage is the organisation's chairman The boss of an organisation that is peddling controversial theories about race to thousands of children as young as five is an anti-Brexit cycling enthusiast who previously ran a software firm. Chris Kenyon is the CEO of The Key, a firm with a £30million turnover that provides learning and leadership resources to more than 13,000 schools and educational trusts in the UK. The other directors of The Key include angel investor and mother-of-three Samantha Tubb - who serves as a non-executive director - and venture capitalist Ian Armitage, who is the organisation's chairman.  Analysis of its anti-racism guidance and training tools distributed by The Key found resources that critics argued are grounded on hugely controversial critical race theory, which focuses on the idea that racism is entrenched in society and white people are oppressors. One resource recommended to teachers by The Key to help them talk to their pupils features a pyramid explaining the difference between 'overt' and 'covert' white supremacy.  Mr Kenyon's Twitter handle features the word 'EU' and his Instagram account shows him at a pro-EU rally in 2019. Tweets sent before he became boss of The Key in 2019 show him raging against Brexit, which in one post he called a 'shambles'.  He is also the founder of pro-cycling organisation called Cycling Works and before his current post was a senior vice-president at software firm Canonical.  All three are listed as directors in documents filed with Companies House.  Mr Kenyon was appointed as boss of The Key in February 2019, succeeding Fergal Roche, who had left in October 2018.                                              Revealed: Dossier of 'critical race theory' being taught in British schools - including 'Pyramid of White Supremacy' and books that tell children as young as four that racism started because 'white people wanted more control over others'                                          A press release featured high praise for Mr Kenyon from chairman Mr Armitage, who said he had a 'highly successful track record of scaling up a business in a very competitive international market.  'He is committed, passionate and purpose driven.' In one photo posted on his Instagram account, from June 2017, Mr Kenyon is seen wearing a jumper displaying the the 'I'm In' message of the Remain campaign as he rides a bike carrying his children. In another, he displays a poster being held up by a mother and baby at a pro-EU rally in March 2019. The poster reads: 'You won... and you f***ed it up #Revoke'.  The businessman studied political theory at the University of Edinburgh.  In a tweet opposing the result in the 2016 EU referendum, Mr Kenyon said: 'Instead of resolving the substantive issues of our day like housing we are committed to years of Brexit shambles and recession.' Mr Armitage is also a trustee for Governors for Schools, an organisation that encourages people to become school governors. He is described on its website as an 'experienced venture capitalist and private equity investor in a career spanning more than 30 years.' He founded private equity firm HgCapital, which manages investors' assets in the region of $55billion.  Mr Armitage is also a trustee of the Golf Foundation and 'embraces new ideas and change.' Ms Tubb, who also serves as chairwoman of The Key's audit committee, says on her LinkedIn profile that she has been an an angel investor since 2009 and has a particular passion for 'supporting female-led businesses.'  'I rarely invest money without also investing time; start-up and scale-up journeys can be lonely for founders and I provide experience-backed support wherever possible within my portfolio,' she adds.                                              Revealed: How Church of England schools are teaching 'Pyramid of White Supremacy' theory in schools which tells children that 'not confronting racism' can lead to genocide                                          She is also listed as a non executive director with the 'Menopause Experts Group' and venue hire platform Sharesy. Mr Kenyon told MailOnline: 'The Key supports school leaders to navigate an enormous variety of topics through thousands of articles. Some of these topics are difficult and need to be handled with care. 'We do collate and signpost a range of third-party content and resources, as well as advice from experienced practitioners in schools.  'We don't set lesson plans or curriculum, these are materials that headteachers read and discuss with staff and governors in the context of their own school settings.' Mr Armitage and Ms Tubb have been approached for comment.  Michael McGarvey, The Key's managing director defended the organisation yesterday. 'Our job is to support schools with any challenges they face, including engaging with complex topics such as promoting equality and addressing racist or prejudiced attitudes,' he said. One document put together by The Key, titled 'how to talk about racism', tells teachers that their pupils are 'never too young' to discuss it.  It directed teachers to a US infographic stating that white five-year-olds are 'strongly biased in favour of whiteness.'  It also encourages teachers to 'start these conversations early', adding that 'children recognise race from a young age'. It tells teachers not to ignore racial difference by saying things such as, "everyone is the same at our school, we don't think/talk about race". It adds: 'Police brutality and incidents like the death of George Floyd might not seem age appropriate for primary school pupils, but children of all ages are likely to have heard about these issues in the news or discussed them at home.' Floyd, an unarmed black man, was murdered by US police in 2020, an act which triggered global Black Lives Matter protests.  A resource that the Key says could 'help you with these conversations' is titled 'A Teacher Toolkit on Race' that was put together by educator Sarah Sarwar. It features a graphic in the shape of a pyramid that is divided between 'overt white supremacy (socially unacceptable) at the top and 'covert white supremacy (socially acceptable) in the rest. The former displays terms including 'lynching', 'the n-word' and 'racial slurs'. Alleged examples of covert white supremacy include 'paternalism', 'anti-immigration policies/practices', 'claiming reverse racism' and 'English-only initiatives'.  Separate guidance on dealing with 'white privilege' tells teachers to change the way they speak to white pupils who do not feel privileged. It says some pupils may become 'defensive' and 'not accept' that they have privilege because of their skin colour. If upset students tell them they are 'gay, poor, female', teachers are told this 'doesn't erase their identity'. Staff are further instructed to 'decolonise' lessons plans and avoid teaching 'white saviour narratives', such as centring white abolitionists when teaching children about slavery. This also includes widening music curriculums to ensure that at least 50 per cent of the musicians or composers are from an ethnic minority background. Tomiwa Owolade, author of This is not America, told The Times that theories that originate in the US do not 'reflect the actual experiences of British children and ethnic minority people in the UK'. He added: 'Critical race theory came out of American constitutional law. It's the argument that after the end of segregation, America had still failed to improve the lives and conditions of black people. 'That very particular context simply doesn't apply to the UK, because we've never had segregation institutionalised in the UK.' The Key was recently featured in a landmark report by pressure group Don't Divide Us (DDU), which found that an increasing number of British schools are teaching contested racial theories, often via third-party organisations. Alka Sehgal Cuthbert, DDU's director and the lead author of the report, said of the latest revelations: 'What is worrying here is that this is being promoted in schools, where the relationships aren't equal.  'That is a huge ethical barrier that is completely ignored.  'The underlying theme of this is that the purpose of school is to produce activists who have views and who have made political judgements in accordance with the organisations distributing these resources.  'It is ridiculous. I am pro Brexit but would never have taught my political views as they if they were fact. It's indoctrination not education,' she told MailOnline.  The Key was founded in 2007 as a government pilot to provide 'up-to-the-minute sector intelligence' for education leaders.  More than 120,000 school leaders are said to use the services. The company provides packages of digital resources, which can cost up to £2,451 per school, boasts that it provides 'reliable, relevant and authoritative knowledge that's ready to use'.
