   King’s Speech to unveil government’s plans at first State Opening for Parliament -live The Independent (United Kingdom) November 6, 2023 Monday 3:35 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: UK POLITICS,UK; Version:8 Length: 4307 words Byline: Maryam Zakir-Hussain and Joe Middleton Highlight: The speech will commence at 11.30am following the Royal Procession Body   Parliament is set to hear the annual King’s Speech at 11.30am today , as the monarch  sets out Rishi Sunak ’s government’s policy agenda for the year ahead. It will be the first such speech King Charles III  has made since assuming the throne last year. It will also be the first of Mr Sunak’s tenure in No 10 – and most likely the last prior to an expected general election next year. It falls on the annual state opening of parliament, a day of pomp and ceremony involving traditions such as searching the Palace of Westminster  for gunpowder, Black Rod banging on the door of the Commons, and the taking of one MP “hostage” to secure the safe return of the monarch. The government is expected to expand the use of whole-life prison sentences to include any murder involving sexual or sadistic conduct. Following several high-profile murder cases in which those convicted refuse to attend their sentencing hearings , the government has promised to update the law in a bid to force them to do so.                      Key points                                         Suella Braverman plan to stop tents for homeless people junked from Kings Speech by No 10                    Home secretary Suella Braverman ’s plan to restrict charities from giving out tents to homeless  people has been junked from the King’s Speech  by No 10. Rishi Sunak  is uncomfortable with the language used by Ms Braverman after she was roundly condemned for describing said rough sleeping “lifestyle choice” , The Independent understands. The right-wing cabinet minister had proposed establishing a civil offence to deter charities from providing tents to homeless people in need.  Suella Braverman plan to stop tents for homeless people junked from Kings Speech                      King’s Speech 2023: Charles and Black Rod’s roles in the State Opening of Parliament explained                    On Tuesday, King Charles will deliver his first State Opening of Parliament as monarch – an event that has been long been steeped in custom, pomp and pageantry. The event marks the formal start of the parliamentary year and sets out the government’s proposed policies and legislation for the 2023-24 session. The late Queen Elizabeth II  delivered the speech a total of 67 times during her reign and only missed it only a handful of times including the year of her death last year. Charles delivered a speech on behalf of his mother in May 2022.  He will now be embracing traditions that have been in place since the 16th century for the first time as monarch. Here’s all of the pomp and pageantry to expect from the event… All of the pomp and pageantry surrounding the King at the State Opening of Parliament                      Alex Chalk rejects suggestion King’s Speech measures are focused on general election                    Justice Secretary Alex Chalk rejected the suggestion that the measures in the King’s Speech were focused on a general election, expected next year.  He told LBC: “I would respectfully disagree. You’re right, there is a general election in the air, that’s correct. “A lot of the things that we are doing are things that we have been thinking about for some time. So I myself personally, when I wasn’t in government last year, I was speaking at the Conservative Party conference, and a lot of what we’re going to do, they’re the very measures that I was talking about then. “These are things that people like me and others have been thinking about, have been working out, have been doing the intellectual groundwork on and we’re now going to bring them into force.”                      Justice secretary says planned criminal justice reforms about ‘head as well as heart'                    Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said the planned criminal justice reforms, due to be set out in the King’s Speech, were about “head as well as heart”. “It’s something that I’ve been talking about for a long time because I’m a barrister by background, I’ve seen this stuff,” he told Times Radio. “This is about head as well as it is about heart. This is about ensuring that I don’t want you, I don’t want your family, I don’t want my family, to be victims of crime. “So what I want to ensure is that people who are the greatest threat to you and your family are kept out of circulation for longer... but those who are capable of being rehabilitated should be rehabilitated. And that seems to me to be smart.”                      Impact of the King’s Speech will last until the next century, Rishi Sunak suggests                    Theupcoming King’s Speech will help build a “better future” for Britain for the rest of this century, Rishi Sunak  has said. As he prepares to unveil what is on course to be his last programme for government as prime minister, Mr Sunak said the speech would stimulate the economy  and strengthen society, and suggested its legacy would last seven decades. Mr Sunak also pledged to bring forward bills that help people feel safer “in their own communities” and instil a pride in the “place they call home” on Tuesday. The King’s Speech  will be seen as an indication of Mr Sunak’s priorities ahead of the general election, which must be held by January 2025. impact of the King’s Speech will last until the next century, Rishi Sunak suggests                      Andy Burnham urges Sunak to save HS2 Manchester airport link in King’s Speech                    Andy Burnham  and other northern leaders have urged Rishi Sunak  to use the upcoming King’s Speech  to save a stretch of the HS2  rail project between central Manchester  and the city’s airport. The Labour mayor of Greater Manchester said the PM’s decision to scrap the northern leg – first revealed by The Independent  – was a “hammer blow”, but still hopes the key section can be built. He and others are urging the PM to bring back legislation sanctioning HS2 infrastructure so work can begin on a new link between Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester airport which could be used by east-west projects across the North. Andy Burnham urges Sunak to save HS2 Manchester link in King’s Speech                      King’s Speech 2023: When is it and what to expect                    Today we will be focusing on the King’s Speech as the monarch  sets out Rishi Sunak ’s government’s policy agenda for the year ahead.  It will be the first such speech King Charles III  has made since assuming the throne last year. It will also be the first of Mr Sunak’s tenure in No 10 – and most likely the last prior to an expected general election next year. Mr Sunak said: “This will be the first King’s Speech in 70 years and the legislation we will bring forward is part of our plan to build a better future for the next 70.” We take a look at the proposals which are expected to be included in the King’s Speech, at around 11.30am on Tuesday, and those which may be left out: King’s Speech 2023: When is it and what to expect                      Right-wing Tory condemns Braverman over homeless tents remarks                    Right-wing Conservative MP Natalie Elphicke has criticised home secretary Suella Braverman’s proposal for charities to stop giving tents to homeless rough sleepers. “In all my years of helping people who are homeless … at no time, ever, has anyone said the answer lies in the removal of tents.”                      In all my years of helping people who are homeless, in cities like London and Manchester as well as my own local area in Dover and Deal, at no time, ever, has anyone said the answer lies in the removal of tents.— Natalie Elphicke MP (@NatalieElphicke) November 6, 2023                                           Top Boris Johnson advisers joked ‘we’ve banned ourselves from going to the pub’                                          Monday 6 November 2023 16:18 , Joe Middleton Two of Boris Johnson’s top advisers railed against the government’s handling of Covid before joking “worst part, we have banned ourselves from going to the pub after this”.In September 2020, Dr Ben Warner told No10 comms chief Lee Cain he felt like the pair had “walked out of Covid in June and walked back in today”.Mr Cain told Dr Warner “agree mate, we are so fucked”, adding that the government was making the “same errors as March” -a reference to the delayed decision-making process in the early days of the pandemic.WhatsApp messages shown to the inquiry then show Dr Warner telling his colleague: “Worst part, we have banned ourselves from going to the pub after this.”Reporting byArchie MitchellLee Anderson accused of lying about protesters ‘glued to Centotaph’Monday 6 November 2023 16:14 , Joe Middleton Just Stop Oil said deputy Tory chairman Lee Anderson has been “tweeting lies about protesters being glued to The Cenotaph”.The group said activists near the Cenotaph were dragged off the road and arrested by police for protesting in the street.The Metropolitan Police confirmed there were no offences linked to the Cenotaph, though around 100 arrests were made for disruption in Whitehall.Anderson had tweeted: “Simple solution here.

Mr Cummings, then Boris Johnson’s top adviser, told the PM that scientists were doing a “great job” while civil servants were “off the pace”. “You need to tell Sedwill this,” Mr Cummings told Mr Johnson. He added: “The f***** should be in the office now.”                      Boris claims Sunak ‘refused to engage’ post-Covid because he wanted to be PM                    Boris Johnson said Rishi Sunak “refused to engage” with him on kick-starting the UK economy after lockdown because the chancellor wanted to be PM, according to an extract from Nadine Dorries’ book. According to the extract in the Mail, Mr Johnson told Ms Dorries: “Looking back, I can see that’s because there was a plan to remove me, and people were saying to him: ‘Don’t give him anything.’He had been given the impression by someone that he should simply bide his time as chancellor until the bigger prize became his.”                      NHS was considered ‘f*****’ in any scenario                    The Covid inquiry has been shown notes from a February 2020 meeting by data scientist and former No10 adviser Dr Ben Warner which showed that he believed the NHS was “f***** in any scenario”. Dr Warner clarified that what he meant was that the health service would be under “extreme stress” in any scenation. Reporting byArchie Mitchell                      Starmer faces plot by Labour rebel MPs to force Commons vote on Gaza ceasefire                    Sir Keir Starmer is facing a rebellion by left-wing Labour MPs who are trying to force a vote on a Gaza ceasefire in parliament. The Labour leader is under growing pressure to change stance as his party suffers a major split on his refusal to back a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict. At least 18 Labour frontbenchers have defied Sir Keir’s position, while more than 30 councillors have quit the party and more than 330 local leaders have urged him to back down.                      Can Rishi Sunak ever escape Boris Johnson’s shadow?                    As the former PM makes a surprise visit to Israel, the present incumbent of No 10 is still struggling to shrug off his predecessor, writes Kate Devlin. And there is much more still to come Can Rishi Sunak ever escape Boris Johnson’s shadow?                      Home Office was worried about ‘social unrest’ caused by ‘survival of fittest’ in pandemic                    The Home Office believed a “survival of the fittest” scenario might unfold during the pandemic, with potential public unrest as services became overwhelmed. The Covid-19 Inquiry has been shown minutes from a planning exercise in February 2020 dubbed operation Nimbus, in which attendees were warned to expect 840,000 deaths in a “reasonable worst case scenario”. The meeting minutes said that in the scenario, Matt Hancock who was chairing asked what “key decisions” would need to be made about care. A representative from NHS England said decisions would have to be made about “whether to expand the intensive care capacity at the consequence of stopping treatment to others. The Home Office said the social consequences would amount to a “survival of the fittest” situation which could lead to “social unrest”. One of the recommendations after the meeting was that those involved in strategic decision-making during the pandemic be offered mental health support. Reporting byArchie Mitchell                      Sunak says Tory MP rape allegation complainant should ‘go to the police’                                         Boris Johnson referred to Treasury as ‘pro-death squad’, Covid inquiry hears                    Boris Johnson referred to the Treasury as the “pro-death squad” during the pandemic, the UK Covid-19 Inquiry has heard. The former prime minister reportedly used the phrase at a meeting in January 2021 when he wanted the ministry to back him in arguing for a path to eased restrictions. Giving evidence to the inquiry on Monday, Mr Johnson’s pandemic-era deputy principal private secretary, Stuart Glassborow, said he did not recall hearing the term. Reading from former chief scientific adviser to the Government Sir Patrick Vallance’s diary, where the phrase was noted, Mr Keating went on: “There is an entry... at meeting on 25 January 2021 the PM is recorded saying he wants Tier 3 March 1, Tier 2 April 1, Tier 1 May 1 and nothing by September. “And he ends it by saying the team must bring in the pro-death squad from HMT”. “I think (this) refers to a meeting from a couple of years ago. I don’t recall that specific phrase,” Mr Glassborow said. “I see that this is from Patrick’s notebook. I wouldn’t dispute what he’s recorded, but I don’t recall the phrase at all.”                      Suella Braverman under fire after vowing crackdown on tents and claiming rough sleeping is ‘lifestyle choice’                    Suella Braverman has prompted outrage after she vowed a crackdown on tents used by the homeless and described rough sleeping as a “lifestyle choice”. The home secretary claimed streets risked being “taken over” and that without action British cities would see “an explosion of crime, drug taking, and squalor”. She added that many of those living in tents were “from abroad”. Those who were genuinely homeless would always be supported, she said. Suella Braverman under fire after claiming rough sleeping is ‘lifestyle choice’                      Majority of Tory members want Nigel Farage back in the party, poll reveals                    More than seven in 10 Tory members want Nigel Farage to be readmitted to the party, a poll has revealed. The former Brexit Party leader’s popularity among the Conservative grassroots is laid bare in the Conservative Home survey, which shows the rank and file overwhelmingly back his membership. Mr Farage quit the Conservative Party in 1992 after John Major signed the Maastricht Treaty, but has increasingly hinted at a return, even joking he would be surprised if he wasn’t Tory leader by 2026. Most Tory members want Nigel Farage back in the party, poll reveals                      Tory minister distances herself from Suella Braverman’s comment on rough sleeping                                         Reasons for homelessness are ‘complex’, say No 10                    A spokesman for Rishi Sunak could not say whether the government had evidence to back up the Home Secretary Suella Braverman’s claim that some people are rough sleeping as a “lifestyle choice”. “The reasons are complex, I think mental health and addiction are drivers of homelessness,” he said. Asked if the prime minister ever gets tired of having to defend Ms Braverman, he said: “The Prime Minister continues to work closely with the Home Secretary, not least on this issue of protests... and of course on small boats.”                      Energy secretary admits Rishi Sunak’s north sea oil expansion plans ‘won’t bring bills down’                    The energy secretary has admitted that Rishi Sunak’s flagship energy policy will not bring household bills down. Claire Coutinho was quizzed about the government’s plans to expand North Sea oil and gas exploration expected to be announced in the King’s Speech tomorrow. The prime minister will declare the drive, which would invite annual applications for new licences to drill for oil and gas, will protect jobs and boost energy security “without adding undue burdens on households”. Energy secretary admits Sunak’s north sea oil expansion ‘won’t bring bills down’                      Rishi Sunak shares thoughts on homelessness                                         More than a hundred British citizens have left Gaza, say No 10                    More than a hundred British citizens have left Gaza through the Rafah crossing so far, Downing Street said. No 10 did not without confirm how many more are trapped inside the territory. The prime minister’s official spokesman told reporters: “It’s more than a hundred who have made it through the crossing. “We are in contact with those who still remain, the British nationals who still remain in Gaza to update on the latest information we have. “And we’ve got UK teams forward-deployed to receive those as they do make it through. “I don’t have an update on the Rafah crossing as of right now, but obviously it’s disappointing it has been closed recently. It is obviously a complex situation and we will use all diplomatic options available to us to press for its reopening in co-ordination with our partners.” Some 200 British nationals and their dependents were registered with the authorities to leave Gaza, meaning around half have made it out.                      Sunak says Tory MP rape allegation complainant should ‘go to the police’                                         Sunak declines to back Braverman’s comments about rough-sleeping homeless                    Rishi Sunak did not accept that his home secretary Suella Braverman’s description of rough sleeping as a “lifestyle choice” was offensive – but did not back her comments. Asked by broadcasters if the language was “offensive”, he said: “I don’t want anyone to sleep rough on our streets.“That’s why the government is investing £2bn over the next few years to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping.  “I’m pleased that the number of people sleeping rough is down by a third since the peak, but of course there is more to do … So I’m proud of that record.He added: “But of course there is more to do and we’ll keep going so that nobody has to sleep rough on our streets.”                      Lombardelli: ‘Not possible to estimate cost of lockdown’                                         The Independent’s Archie Mitchell is covering the Covid inquiry today. He reports that Clare Lombardelli has told the Covid inquiry it was not possible to estimate the cost of lockdowns.The Treasury’s former chief economic adviser said there was no way to say “a lockdown in this form will cost you X” because there was “no reasonable counterfactual” of what people would do without a lockdown. But the inquiry was also shown an advice document produced for then chancellor Rishi Sunak by the Treasury in which he was told to “push back strongly” against the idea of a circuit-breaker lockdown in autumn 2020. Officials warned Mr Sunak the impacts would be “severe”.

Sunak says police have support for ‘clamp down’ on criminality at Pro-Palestine protest                    Rishi Sunak said that Metropolitan Police have ministers’ “absolute and total backing” to tackle criminality, ahead of a pro-Palestinian march on Saturday. It comes amid concerns by some that the pro-Palestinian march in London will go ahead on Armistice Day.Speaking to broadcasters on Monday, the PM said: “Remembrance Day is a time for national reflection … I want to make sure police have our absolute and total backing to clamp down on any acts of criminality, but also to ensure public order.” He said that home secretary Suella Braverman would be holding a meeting to discuss the issue on Monday. Mr Sunak also welcomed the fact 100 British nationals have been able to leave Gaza in recent days, as he explained why he backed a humanitarian pause – but not a ceasefire.“We have been very clear and consistent that we support humanitarian pauses, which are there specifically to allow aid to get into Gaza and hostages and foreign nationals to come out.”                      Tory peer: ‘Conservatives have a problem with bullying and sexual misconduct’                    A Conservative peer has said the Tory party has “a problem” dealing with allegations of bullying and sexual misconduct. Baroness Warsi told Times Radio the Conservatives have long “failed” to respond to and support victims. She said: “I think it does have a problem...Whether it’s bullying, whether it’s allegations of racism and now allegations of sexual misconduct, the party for years and years has simply failed to deal with responding to victims appropriately in all of those areas. And I really hope, rather than just batting this away again, that the party take a long, hard look at itself.” And she described a “rot” at the heart of the Conservative party, adding: “We cannot be the party of government which governs in this country more than any other political party and still have this rot at the heart of us, whether that’s racism, whether that’s bullying, whether that’s sexual misconduct. We need to be above these matters and we need to see when they come to light, deal with them quickly and coherently, and make sure that all people feel protected within our party.”                      Sunak says Tory MP rape allegation complainant should ‘go to the police’                    Rishi Sunak  has described allegations that a Tory MP committed a series of rapes as “very serious” as he urged anyone with evidence of criminal acts to talk to the police. The PM has been urged to launch an investigation into claims the Conservatives  failed to properly deal with allegations of rape against one of its MPs. It comes after it was reported that Sir Jake Berry , a former Tory chairman, told police that an internal “failure” to act on allegations of rape allowed an unnamed MP to “continue to offend”. Sunak says Tory MP rape allegation complainant should ‘go to the police’                      NHS patients hit by ‘severe drug shortages’ due to Brexit red tape                    NHS patients face a “very worrying” risk due to “severe delays” in drugs supplies caused by Brexit red tape, experts have warned. Vital antibiotics, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) drugs are among those in desperately short supply this winter – with the NHS forced to pay over the odds to get drugs into Britain. Leading British health experts backing a new report on post-Brexit problems in the health service, which has been shared with The Independent, have also highlighted recent problems obtaining antidepressants and medication for high blood pressure. NHS hit by ‘severe drug shortages’ due to Brexit red tape                      Allegations a Tory MP committed a series of rapes is ‘very serious’, says PM                    Prime minister Rishi Sunak has described allegations that a Tory MP committed a series of rapes as “very serious”. He urged anyone with evidence of criminal acts to talk to the police. Speaking on a visit to Bacton Gas Terminal in Norfolk, the Prime Minister told broadcasters: “These are very serious, anonymous allegations. “It may be that they allude to something that is already the subject of a live police investigation, so I hope you understand it wouldn’t be right for me to comment on that further specifically. “More broadly the Conservative Party has robust independent complaint procedures in place, but I would say to anybody who has information or evidence about any criminal acts to of course talk to police, that’s the right course of action.”                      Deputy prime minister denies cover-up of rape allegation against Tory MP                    The deputy prime minister  has denied that the Conservatives covered up a rape allegation against one of their own MPs. Oliver Dowden insisted the Tory party has a “zero tolerance” approach to sexual misconduct after claims allegations of rape against an MP were not properly handled, potentially allowing them to continue to offend. But he said he could not “say for certain” that his party did not pay an alleged victim’s private hospital fees. And the former party chair, who stood down from the role in June 2022, urged anyone with concerns to take them to the police. His comments came after it emerged that former party chair Sir Jake Berry wrote to police amid concerns over how the allegations of rape were dealt with, according to a letter published in The Mail on Sunday.
