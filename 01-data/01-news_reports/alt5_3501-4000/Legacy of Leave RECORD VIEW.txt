   Legacy of Leave; RECORD VIEW Daily Record and Sunday Mail June 20, 2023 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Copyright © 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; FRONT PAGE; Pg. 14 Length: 145 words Body   THE Brexit bus promise of an extra £350million a week for the NHS if we voted to leave the European Union has long been since exposed as a lie. But not only was there no huge cash injection to bail out the struggling NHS, Brexit ruined any hope of getting back on track by causing massive staff shortages. Fewer EU care workers, nurses and doctors coming into the country to prop up our medical services has, in part, created longer waiting lists at our hospital front doors. While the problem is not entirely down to Brexit, there is no doubt it is a major factor. The EU exit has also led to delays in getting much-needed medicines and puts us at the bottom of the queue for groundbreaking new treatments and technologies developed abroad. The architects of Brexit are disappearing but the ramifications of their lies will be felt for generations. BREXIT BROKE NHS - PAGES 10&11 Load-Date: June 20, 2023  End of Document
