   FM misleading on farm Brexit claims; LETTERS Daily Post (North Wales) February 23, 2024 Friday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Copyright © 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: LETTERS; Pg. 16 Length: 187 words Body   THE First Minister told the Senedd on 20th February that the Sustainable Farming Scheme proposals were '… because farmers in Wales…voted to leave the European Union.' As someone who was President of the Farmers' Union of Wales at the time, and campaigned tirelessly against Brexit in the years running up to the referendum, I can confirm this statement is grossly misleading. A 2016 poll of FUW members found 69% had voted remain, while an earlier Farmers Weekly poll found that the proportion of farmers in Wales wanting to leave was less than 50%. In any case, Mr Drakeford well knows that the number of farmers in Wales is far too low to have outnumbered the vast numbers of non farmers who were beguiled into voting leave by false claims about Brexit. It is true to say that Brexit has allowed the UK Government to break its Brexit promise by cutting Wales' agricultural and rural affairs allocation by around £240m. But agricultural policy is devolved to Wales, so Welsh Government proposals to bring in costly changes that slash jobs and already low farm incomes are entirely its own decision.
