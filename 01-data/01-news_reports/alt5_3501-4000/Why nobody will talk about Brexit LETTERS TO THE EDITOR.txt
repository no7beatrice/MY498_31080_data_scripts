   Why nobody will talk about Brexit; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR The Sunday Times (London) June 30, 2024 Sunday Edition 1, Scotland  Copyright 2024 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 22 Length: 123 words Body   Tim Shipman is quite right about Brexit being the pachyderm in the room at this election ("When will we break the Brexit omerta?", News Review, last week). English politicians seem to fear speaking of it in the same way as actors avoid naming "the Scottish play". But part of the enormous desire to oust this government is down to an unspoken desire to overthrow Brexit. Those who voted Remain have not changed their minds, and many who voted Leave have decided it was a bad decision. The majority of us want Brexit overturned, but without a repeat of the acrimony and division of the referendum. When ardent Brexiteers loudly warn that "Starmer will take us back into the EU", millions breathe a hushed: "Oh, I do hope so!" Frank Dean, Stockport Load-Date: June 30, 2024  End of Document
