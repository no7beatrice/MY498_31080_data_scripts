   Brexit 'worst of both worlds' Grimsby Telegraph March 2, 2024 Saturday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 12 Length: 190 words Body   THE Government is failing to use Brexit freedoms to shake off unnecessary regulation, ministers have been told. Former permanent secretary to the Treasury and independent crossbench peer Lord Macpherson of Earl's Court said it was "disappointing" that more progress had not been made. Meanwhile, former Tory MEP and prominent Eurosceptic Lord Hannan of Kingsclere argued that the UK has the "worst of both worlds" after paying "a high price" for regulatory autonomy in the Brexit talks while not making use of it. Lord Hannan told peers in Westminster: "I had assumed, rather innocently and naively I now see, that the first response of the Government after Brexit would be to go back and look at all the measures which the UK had opposed and voted against in Council, look at the departmental arguments raised against them, and then see if those still apply. "That, I'm afraid to say, has not happened." He added: "I was quite wet about Brexit, I wanted a Swiss-type deal all the way through, I argued that we should have maintained a lot of the accumulated single market measures, I think it would have solved a lot of problems. We didn't do that." Load-Date: March 2, 2024  End of Document
