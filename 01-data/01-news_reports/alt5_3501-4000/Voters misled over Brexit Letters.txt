   Voters misled over Brexit; Letters East Anglian Daily Times September 2, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 26 Length: 123 words Body   YOUR correspondent Ian Smith is in denial, I have always thought. It is now being realised since we Britons set off on our solo journey out of the EU that most who voted Brexit now say they feel they were misled. Of course you were misled. That was, I believe, the intention of the infamous unelected Nigel Farage and his cohorts. It was Farage standing before a poster showing refugees entering a Turkish refugee camp saying "they are coming" and suggesting that his Brexit would stop them coming. We now know that the opposite is true. His Brexit made them want to come. We threw away the option to process these desperate people in EU nations. He now blames others for the disaster that Brexit has inflicted on our nation. BOB HOGGAR, Halesworth. Load-Date: September 2, 2023  End of Document
