   Campaigner ejected from Conservative Party meeting The Western Mail October 3, 2023 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 3 Length: 191 words Body   ANTI-BREXIT campaigner Steve Bray has been ejected from a fringe meeting at the Conservative Party Conference. Mr Bray, from Port Talbot, was escorted from a meeting of the right-wing Bruges Group outside the secure zone in Manchester city centre after interrupting a speaker. Wearing a blue pro-EU T-shirt, Mr Bray said: "Where are the Brexit benefits?" After briefly grappling with an audience member, he was escorted from the venue, continuing to protest and describing the attendees as "losers". He said: "Brexit benefits, my arse. What a load of bullshit, never heard so much crap in my life." The meeting at the Friends' Meeting House on the subject of whether the Conservatives could win the next election had been due to be addressed by party vicechair Lee Anderson but the Ashfield MP had pulled out at short notice. Mr Bray has staged a long-running protest against Brexit, with a weekly demonstration in Parliament Square while the House of Commons is sitting, and has gone to Manchester to protest at the Conservative conference. During debates on Brexit, he was often seen and heard in the background of news broadcasts from near Parliament. Graphic    >>Steve Bray Load-Date: October 3, 2023  End of Document
