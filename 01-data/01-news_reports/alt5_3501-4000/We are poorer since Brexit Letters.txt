   We are poorer since Brexit; Letters East Anglian Daily Times June 8, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 26 Length: 197 words Body   IAN Smith once again writes to say he hasn't changed his mind about voting for Brexit and says the issue is that it isn't the right sort of Brexit. I do not recall there being any choice of types of Brexit at the referendum. I do recall a booklet through the door making it plain the populace would not benefit in many ways from leaving a huge trade bloc, forged because of a sincere post-war desire for peace in Europe, in the government's opinion. I also recall the people being denied a vote on the specific outcome of that referendum on hearing the shenanigans leading up to it. I also read that often, some of the types pushing for Brexit had hard right connections and so do national tabloid newspapers in every newsagent stand. We are poorer now and poverty is linked to crime, poor health, education, relationships, age expectancy and productivity. So, now they're blaming the "boats" for our misery. I blame the types coming over to our tax-free 'freeports' in private jets to exploit our workers and buy our industries including facilities, unprotected by the EU working time directive and other rights ordinary people had won since the Second World War.
