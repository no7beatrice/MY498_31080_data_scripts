   Brexit was never about money ...it was about regaining control; LETTERS Coventry Evening Telegraph May 29, 2024 Wednesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Copyright © 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 12 Length: 181 words Body   MUCH correspondence lately appears to be anti-Brexit in nature, with the writers all seemingly alluding that 'Brexit has failed', or that 'Brexit has been a disaster'. Such statements ignore the fact that the UK is now the 4th largest exporter in the world, having leapfrogged France, Japan and the Netherlands according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and also fails to recognise the Brexit was never about money or economics, it was about national sovereignty and regaining control of our borders, and that is far more precious than a few extra percentage points on Britain's GDP will ever be. That is certainly why I campaigned and voted for Brexit, and I have no regrets. Any failings supposedly caused by Brexit should be laid at the doors of our own elected politicians who have failed to take proper advantage of our new found freedoms and also failed to implement a more robust immigration system, when it comes to both legal and illegal immigration. Leaving the ECHR, although not an EU institution, would certainly help in that regard. P. Sheehan, Coventry. Load-Date: May 29, 2024  End of Document
