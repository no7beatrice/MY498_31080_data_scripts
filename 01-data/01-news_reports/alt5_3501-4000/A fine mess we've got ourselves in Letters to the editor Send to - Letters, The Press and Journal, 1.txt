A front-page headline in the FT was "UK government climbs down on post-Brexit product mark", rather than a new "costly red tape Brexit UKCA" safety mark. It was the latest in a never-ending series confirming that Brexit was economically bad for the UK. Brexit so far fails UK farmers, fish workers and many manufacturers. Is this CE concession the start of "Brexit repair"? Who politically makes the repair, and how, is crucial to our economic outcome. Political parties are wholly polarised, even internally. The UK desperately needs collaborative apolitical purpose strategies, via proportional representation, after recent years of constitutional undermining and antidemocratic government action. Radical change is needed. But I cannot see politically from where this may come; so I must choose and perhaps influence others. Perhaps the "known Mr Miseries on Indy" in P&J letters can help www.me.UK finances, compared to G7, are in a poor state. Rather than say where I should not vote, be positive Mr Gradgrind and say where to place my vote and how it will retrieve our economy. Mike Hannan. Cults.
