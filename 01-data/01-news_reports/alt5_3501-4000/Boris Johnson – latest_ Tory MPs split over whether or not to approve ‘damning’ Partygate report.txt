   Boris Johnson – latest: Tory MPs split over whether or not to approve ‘damning’ Partygate report The Independent (United Kingdom) June 16, 2023 Friday 4:22 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: UK POLITICS,UK; Version:1 Length: 5116 words Byline: Matt Mathers,Joe Middleton and Maroosha Muzaffar Highlight: Despite scathing Privileges Committee report, Boris Johnson’s controversial honours list won’t be axed, Downing Street says Body   Tory MPs are reportedly torn over whether or not to approve the “damning” Partygate  report over Boris Johnson.   Some conservative MPs are reportedly “hovering” between voting for the report and abstaining, according to the BBC. A report into Partygate has laid bare Mr Johnson’s final disgrace, but No 10  said it will not axe his controversial resignation honours list. A cross-party committee of MPs found the former prime minister repeatedly lied to Parliament before being complicit in a campaign of abuse and intimidation. The Privileges Committee recommended a 90-day suspension which would have paved the way for a by-election if he had not dramatically quit. They concluded he should be barred from holding a pass to parliament. But Downing Street  said it had no plans to scrap Mr Johnson’s resignation list, in which he gave honours to allies embroiled in Partygate. “When it comes to honours, that’s a long-standing convention, the prime minister has abided by convention, that’s not going to change,” Rishi Sunak ’s spokesperson said. His arch-ally Nadine Dorries also said any Tory MP who votes to approve the report is “fundamentally not a Conservative”.                      Key Points                                                                Tory MPs split over 'damning' Partygate report                       Johnson committed ‘repeated contempts’ of parliament                       ‘No precedent for a PM to deliberately mislead Commons'                       Former PM would have faced 90-day suspension                       Report in full: Read all 30,000 words of Partygate committee findings                       Boris accuses Partygate probe of lying about him                                                               Tory MPs split over 'damning' Partygate report                    Tory MPs are split over whether or not to approve the “damning” Partygate report. Several MPs told the media that they were “hovering” between voting and abstaining. One Conservative MP told BBC: “I think I’m hovering between voting for the report and abstaining, the latter solely because voting for it will rile members.” Another member said: “The report speaks for itself.” They described the 90-day suspension as “a bit tough, but hey-ho”. Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg told Sky News: “Inevitably, Boris will lose the vote because you have the whole of the Opposition against him… you also have the Boris haters in the Conservative Party.” Nadine Dorries tweeted: “Any Conservative MP who would vote for this report is fundamentally not a Conservative and will be held to account by members and the public. Deselections may follow. It’s serious.”                      Angela Rayner labels Johnson 'pound shop Trump' after report finds he misled MPs                                         Boris Johnson should be banned from parliament for ‘unprecedented’ lies, rules Partygate committee                    Boris Johnson  has been found in contempt of parliament for deliberately lying to the Commons about Partygate  in an utterly scathing report by a cross-party group of MPs. The former PM would have faced a suspension of 90 days for deliberately misleading MPs and “being complicit in the campaign of abuse and attempted intimidation” of the privileges committee. The committee also found that Mr Johnson be banned from parliament – recommending that he should not be entitled to a former member’s pass. Mr Johnson immediately fired back at the verdict – claiming the committee was “beneath contempt” because it reached a “deranged conclusion” to deliver “what is intended to be the final knife-thrust in a protracted political assassination”.

The 106 page document, put together by the cross-party group of MPs with a Tory majority, is packed with detail and arguments.

A report into Partygate has found that Johnson repeatedly lied to Parliament about gatherings in Downing Street during lockdown, and was “complicit in a campaign of abuse and intimidation” of the privileges committee. Johnson has criticised the findings, calling them a “deranged conclusion” and accusing the Tory-majority group of MPs, who he has repeatedly sought to disparage, of lying.

The ex prime minister is facing a ban from holding a parliamentary security pass after a devastating cross-party committee blasted his handling of the Partygate scandal.

MPs who support the privileges committee’s findings were “fundamentally not” Conservative and would be “held to account”, the ex-culture secretary claimed. A small group of fellow Johnson allies also vowed to vote against the “vindicative” report on Monday – and warned those who back it could be “given the boot” by angry, grassroots Tory members.

Max Hastings, who was editor of The Daily Telegraph when Mr Johnson worked there, slated his ex-staffer’s behaviour after the privileges committee report found he repeatedly lied to Parliament before being complicit in a campaign of abuse and intimidation. “I don’t hate Boris Johnson. He is what he always was – doing what the dog does against the lamppost,” Mr Hastings told the BBC.

In a sensational verdict a cross-party group of MPs recommended that he face a 90-day suspension – nearly twice as long as Liz Truss was prime minister – had he not dramatically quit the Commons last week. The former prime minister should still suffer the humiliation of being stripped of a pass to the House of Commons, the privileges committee ruled.

Chris Bryant, the chair of the Commons standards committee, told the Independent: “He’s a disgraced former prime minister. You really wouldn’t normally want a disgraced former minister carrying on in the Privy Council. “But I don’t suppose for a second that Boris Johnson has enough insight into what he’s done and feels at all accountable. So I don’t suppose for a second that he will stand down.” He added: “John Profumo was struck off from the privy council for having lied to parliament as a minister.” He also accused Rishi Sunak over “running for the hills over” the scandal. Tory peer Lord Lexden agreed Mr Johnson should no longer be a member of the Privy Council, saying: “To do it in the fevered atmosphere which exists at the moment would risk drawing the monarch into politics, and give Johnson yet another target for his acrimony. It should be done a little later.”What sanctions could Boris Johnson face?Thursday 15 June 2023 17:31 , Joe Middleton In an unprecedented ruling, the cross-party privileges committee has recommended that Boris Johnson be banned from parliament for 90 days, with members unanimously agreeing on a ban of at least 10 days – which would have been enough to trigger a by-election had he not resigned just days earlier.The committee now recommends that he should not be given a former member’s pass, which would effectively ban him from visiting parliament. But his fate ultimately lies in the hands of MPs, who will debate and vote on the committee’s findings on Monday.However, even if MPs do vote to revoke his pass, this decision would be rendered void were Johnson ever to be re-elected as an MP.On Monday, MPs could push for Johnson to be prevented from standing again, but the convention that no parliament can bind its successors means that only those at Conservative Party headquarters could truly stop him trying to be a Tory MP.Another potential route back to parliament that Johnson could consider is via the upper chamber.But according to a former member of the House of Lords appointment commission who spoke to the Financial Times, the committee’s verdict of “contempt” would “be an important factor to be taken into consideration”, and ultimately could enable the Lords commission to block any attempt to hand Johnson a peerage.With Johnson loyalists lining up to condemn the committee’s report ahead of Monday’s Commons showdown, as his critics call for his Honour’s List to be scrapped, it remains to be seen whether the inquiry, the vote – or perhaps a peerage-related snub – could prove to be the former PM’s final indignation.Nadine Dorries ‘off her rocker’, says senior ToryThursday 15 June 2023 17:15 , Joe Middleton Sunak allies told The Independent that Nadine Dorries was “off her rocker” by threatening deselections, and urged colleagues to “show backbone” when the crunch free vote to approve the cross-party report comes on Monday.One senior Tory told The Independent: “Nadine is off her rocker and biting the hand that put her in public life. She is making a show of herself.”Another senior Tory said colleagues should “show backbone” and ignore deselection threats made by Boris Johnson’s allies. “I hope colleagues have the integrity to vote how they want – never mind those stamping their feet.”However, the former minister predicted that there would be an “even mix” of Tory MPs abstain to avoid upsetting Boris-backing constituents, and voting it through to “support the process”. They said there was some “shock” in the Tory tearoom over the harshness of the 90-day suspension.Sunak will take time to ‘fully consider’ Partygate reportThursday 15 June 2023 17:04 , Joe Middleton Rishi Sunak will take time to “fully consider” the Privileges Committee’s report that found Boris Johnson lied to MPs, Downing Street has said.“He hasn’t yet had time to fully consider the report,” a No 10 spokesperson told reporters.“He intends to take the time to fully consider the report.”The spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister will participate in the Commons vote on the committee’s findings on Monday, saying: “We will set out the PM’s activity for next week on Monday.”Partygate report 'in danger of making House of Commons look foolish', Rees-Mogg saysThursday 15 June 2023 16:51 , Joe MiddletonThe five lies that doomed Boris JohnsonThursday 15 June 2023 16:45 , Joe Middleton When the long-awaited report into Boris Johnson’s lockdown lies about Partygate was published on Thursday morning, his resignation as an MP appeared a lot less shocking.The former prime minister had seen an early copy of the report, which concluded he had lied to MPs on an “unprecedented” scale. Had Mr Johnson stayed on as the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, he would have faced a 90-day suspension from Parliament -more than enough to trigger a tough by-election in the constituency.The report also recommended Mr Johnson be stripped of a pass for former MPs, effectively barring him from the parliamentary estate.Archie Mitchell reveals the five lies that led to Mr Johnson’s downfall:The five lies that doomed Boris Johnson Boris Johnson's former boss says ex-prime minister is not 'a decent human being'Thursday 15 June 2023 16:30 , Joe MiddletonBoris Johnson’s ‘sanction more than doubled in length after he attacked Privileges Committee’Thursday 15 June 2023 16:28 , Joe Middleton Boris Johnson’s recommended sanction more than doubled in length after he attacked the Privileges Committee, it has emerged.The former PM was going to face a recommended 40-day suspension from Parliament for repeatedly lying to MPs over Partygate, the Telegraph reported.But after being sent an early copy of the report, Mr Johnson lashed out at the committee, describing it as a “kangaroo court” before quitting as an MP. He said the committee members had “forced him out... anti-democratically”, leading MPs to bump up his sanction in the final copy of the report.While it ended up being merely symbolic after Mr Johnson’s resignation, the former PM faced a recommended 90-day ban from Parliament, more than enough to have triggered a byelection in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat had he stayed in post.For too long, too many Tory MPs have sustained Boris Johnson’s political career, says SNP MPThursday 15 June 2023 16:15 , Joe Middleton SNP MP Richard Thomson said Boris Johnsons has “done his best to mislead and misdirect” and then to “demonise” the committee that compiled the report into Partygate.He added: “I think every member of the Conservative party in the House of Commons has to examine their conscience when we come to vote on this on Monday.“Are they prepared to stand for that?

And if those members feel that they’ve acted in a bad way, or unhelpful way that goes against the principle of democracy and the best interests of the party, which I believe it has, then yes, they should be subject to de-selection,” he said.Former Tory MP says Boris Johnson ‘doesn’t care how much he lies'Thursday 15 June 2023 15:58 , Joe Middleton Former Tory MP Rory Stewart has said that the former prime minister “doesn’t care how much he lies, how many institutions he craps on, as long as he, Boris, manages to continue with his weird cult”.'He doesn't care how much he trashes, how much he lies, how many institutions he craps on -as long as he manages to continue with his weird cult!'Former Tory MP @RoryStewartUK  tells @mrjamesob  what he thinks of Boris Johnson. pic.twitter.com/MT7edLP6ra — LBC (@LBC) June 15, 2023 Former Tory MP labelled ‘crackers’ after claiming Partygate report was ‘revenge for Brexit’Thursday 15 June 2023 15:52 , Joe Middleton Former Tory MP Lord Jackson has been labelled “crackers” after claiming that the Partygate report written by the Privileges Committee was revenge against Boris Johnson due to his support for Brexit.Lord Jackson said: “It is a kangaroo court, the people there are politicians, they are masquerading as a quasi-judicial process, there are people with axes to grind.“There wasn’t due process in my opinion, he has been treated unfairly.

Mr Sunak wore heavy boots and a stab vest as he joined officers on the raid in Brent, north west London, early on Thursday morning. It comes after he promised to abolish the backlog of around 92,000 asylum claims by the end of 2023. However, Home Secretary Suella Braverman told MPs on Wednesday that the target will not be met at the "current pace". Asked after the raid about Ms Braverman’s comments, Mr Sunak said: "It was good to be out this morning with our immigration enforcement team and seeing first-hand their work to tackle illegal working. "That’s an important strand of our work, to stop the boats and tackle illegal migration. "And that’s because the criminal gangs use a business model that tempts people here with the offer of black market work. "It’s not right, which is why we’ve increased resources for immigration enforcement. "We’ve increased the number of raids like the one I was on this morning by 50% and we’ve doubled the number of arrests." He added: "But we’re not complacent. "There’s lots of work to do, which is why it’s so important that we pass our Bill through Parliament, our Stop The Boats Bill, which will mean that if you come here illegally, you will not be able to stay. "We will be able to detain you and then swiftly remove you."                      Two by-elections scheduled for July 20                    The two by-elections triggered by the resignation of Boris Johnson and Nigel Evans will take place on July 20. Mr Evans previously represented the Selby and Ainsty constituency in North Yorkshire and Mr Johnson was the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, in Greater London.

Humza Yousaf was speaking after one of his backbench MSPs had accused the press of making a "big play" of the arrest of former first minister Nicola Sturgeon. Ms Sturgeon was released without charge, pending further investigation, on Sunday evening. SNP MSP James Dornan claimed the "police and the media seem to have some kind of collusion about making sure that the media are in attendance when the slightest thing happens". Police Scotland has denied the accusation, with a spokesman for the force saying: "Any suggestion that the media were informed in advance of an arrest is untrue." Asked about Mr Dornan’s comments by journalists at Holyrood on Thursday, Mr Yousaf said: "I don’t believe that." He said he would not comment further "on a live investigation".

The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice (CBFFJ) UK campaign group said Mr Johnson "should never be allowed to stand for any form of public office again". One member of the group, Fran Hall from Buckinghamshire, said there was "no happiness" at the report’s findings, adding that Mr Johnson is a "disgraced former prime minister", which she said was now "plain and evident to see". The 62-year-old’s husband, Steve Mead, died three weeks after the couple were married in 2020. She told the PA news agency: "There are so many people who are just traumatised by what’s happened to them and the people they love. "They will never recover and there will be no justice. "They’ve just got to live with the knowledge that they have been absolutely let down by the people that were in charge of ensuring that we were kept safe, and we weren’t.
