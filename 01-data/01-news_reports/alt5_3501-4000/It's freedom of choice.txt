   It's freedom of choice The Journal (Newcastle, UK) October 24, 2023 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: FEATURES; Pg. 18 Length: 182 words Body   IT'S now the best part of a decade on from the Brexit referendum and yet we are still having to endure commentators who routinely reference the "B" word without justification. Blaming Brexit for this and that. Pretty well anything really! Neil Walker (The Journal, October 19) is the latest culprit. Labour's new policy on adding VAT to independent school tuition fees, he asserts, is "a direct consequence of Brexit". Call me pedantic if you like, but when you say something is a direct consequence of a prior event you are implying a close linkage. As if Brexit forced Labour to change its policy on private schools. Which is, of course, nonsense. Wouldn't it be more accurate to say that our politicians have a far wider range of choices open to them as a direct consequence of Brexit. And that, in your opinion, Neil, Labour has made a poor choice in going after the independent school sector. Brexit freedoms are now a fact of life. They are directly responsible for greater democratic accountability in our society. More freedom of choice. What's not to like about that?
