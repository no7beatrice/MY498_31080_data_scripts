   Ciao to life in Italy due to Brexit...; www.co.uk DMUULS TUESDAY 01.08.2023 DAILY MIRROR 19 PAT McART The Wise Man from the West Daily Mirror August 1, 2023 Tuesday Edition 1, Northern Ireland  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: FEATURES; OPINION, COLUMN; Pg. 19 Length: 130 words Byline: PAT McART Body   A BRITISH couple in their sixties bought a bargain (EURO)15,000 (£13,000) house in Italy for their retirement but they cannot get a visa to live in it. Greg Walter, from Winchester, says he voted for Brexit but now feels "betrayed". He said: "We were told Brexit was not going to impact our life abroad, that it would be just a matter of formality. People who had second homes in Europe, or planned to buy one, were never given the correct information on the vote outcome." Post-Brexit rules mean they can only spend 90 in every 180 days in Italy. So, Greg and his partner's plan to up-sticks and move permanently to the remote Italian valley of their dreams has gone for a burton. Has anyone ever, anywhere come across a positive Brexit story? There must be one out there… somewhere. Load-Date: October 27, 2023  End of Document
