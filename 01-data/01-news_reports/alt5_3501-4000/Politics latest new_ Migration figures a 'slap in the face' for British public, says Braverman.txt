   Politics latest new: Migration figures a 'slap in the face' for British public, says Braverman telegraph.co.uk November 23, 2023 Thursday 5:15 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 6598 words Byline: By Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor and Dominic Penna, Political Correspondent Body   Suella Braverman has described today’s record net migration figures as a “slap in the face to the British public” as she said Rishi Sunak “must act now” to bring the numbers down.  The former home secretary tweeted: “Today’s record migration stats show we’ve let in an extra million people in just 2 years, a population equivalent to Birmingham. The pressure on housing, the NHS, schools, wages, and community cohesion, is unsustainable. When do we say: enough is enough? “We were elected on a pledge to reduce net migration, which was 229k in 2019. Today’s record numbers are a slap in the face to the British public who have voted to control and reduce migration at every opportunity. We must act now to reduce migration to sustainable levels.” Ms Braverman said Brexit “gave us the tools” to curb high levels of net migration and “it’s time to use them”. She said that when she was in the Government she had pushed to impose an annual cap on net migration and to raise the salary threshold for people coming to the UK to £45,000.  Net migration is estimated to have hit a new peak of 745,000 in the year to December 2022 , according to numbers published this morning by the Office for National Statistics.  The numbers prompted a furious response from Conservative MPs, as they warned tackling legal migration was now a “do or die” issue for the Tory party.  Downing Street said net migration remained “far too high” and promised to leave “no stone unturned” in tackling abuse of the visa system.

That’s an increase of 139,000 since the last estimate provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in May, writes Tom Harris. Let’s put that figure in context: the population of my own home city of Glasgow is 635,000. The population of Manchester is 535,000. We have not (yet) reached the point where a figure equivalent to the population of Birmingham (863,000) is arriving here every year. But give us time. We are a long way indeed from the early 2010s when the Conservatives were promising to reduce net migration to below 100,000 annually.  It would make no sense to claim that this historic increase in our population is in any way sustainable.

But those figures show migration is not being controlled. He added: “By allowing immigrant labour to undercut labour, we reduce the incentive to work and therefore we increase the welfare bill. This is two sides of the same coin.”                      23 Nov 2023-04:15PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak has full confidence in James Cleverly, says No 10                    Downing Street has said Rishi Sunak has full confidence in James Cleverly after a row over his comments about a Labour MP (see 4.07pm). Asked whether Mr Cleverly retained Mr Sunak’s backing, a No 10 spokesman said: “He does, yes. “I’ve also seen that the Home Secretary’s team has clarified and provided an apology for using unparliamentary language. We don’t have anything further to add to that.”                      23 Nov 2023-04:07PM GMT                                         Tory Tees Valley Mayor welcomes Cleverly's apology                    Lord Houchen, the Conservative Mayor of Tees Valley, has welcomed James Cleverly’s apology for using unparliamentary language about a Labour MP. Mr Cleverly has been under pressure to apologise following claims he called Alex Cunningham’s Stockton North constituency a “sh-thole” during Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday. But a source close to Mr Cleverly said his off-the-cuff remark in the Commons had been directed towards the MP, rather than his constituency. Lord Houchen wrote on Twitter: “I’m pleased James Cleverly has apologised for using unparliamentary language. “Whatever was said, the speculation dragged Stockton’s name through the mud, which is unacceptable We’re all human and he’s a good guy who made a mistake Now let’s get back to building Teesside.”                      23 Nov 2023-04:04PM GMT                                         Good afternoon                                         Dominic Penna here, The Telegraph’s Political Correspondent, guiding you through the rest of the day. Former home secretary Suella Braverman took aim at Rishi Sunak in the past half hour in the wake of today’s record net migration figures. Ms Braverman described the statistics as a “slap in the face”, and asked “when do we say: enough is enough?” while criticising the Government for not making more of its post-Brexit freedoms to control migration.                      23 Nov 2023-03:43PM GMT                                         Braverman: Record net migration figures 'a slap in the face to the British people'                    Suella Braverman has described today’s record net migration figures as a “slap in the face to the British public” as she said Rishi Sunak “must act now” to bring the numbers down.

Mr Cleverly has been under pressure to apologise following claims he called Alex Cunningham’s Stockton North constituency a “sh-thole” during Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday. But a source close to Mr Cleverly said his off-the-cuff remark in the Commons had been directed towards the MP, rather than his constituency. “James made a comment. He called Alex Cunningham a sh-t MP. He apologises for unparliamentary language,” the source said. “As was made clear yesterday, he would never criticise Stockton. He’s campaigned in Stockton and is clear that it is a great place.”                      23 Nov 2023-02:42PM GMT                                         Senior Tory calls for James Cleverly apology                     A Tory mayor has demanded an apology from Home Secretary James Cleverly over claims he described Stockton as a “sh-thole”. Mr Cleverly denies making the remark, but Tees Valley mayor Lord Ben Houchen said it was “clear” he should say sorry for “dragging Stockton’s name through the mud”. He condemned “childish and unprofessional language used by Westminster politicians who should know better”.                      23 Nov 2023-01:59PM GMT                                         Rees-Mogg ‘embarrassed’ Tories have not hit migration pledges                    Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was “embarrassed” that the Tories had not managed to deliver on their migration pledges.  Past administrations had promised to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands while in 2019 the Tories said overall numbers will come down.  Sir Jacob told the BBC: “What I was saying earlier was admitting that I am embarrassed that we haven’t achieved what we set out to achieve.  “Your listeners will perfectly reasonably say, well Rees-Mogg is banging on about this but he has been a Tory MP for the whole of this period and I have been and therefore I must take some share of responsibility for the fact that we haven’t achieved the tens of thousands that we promised.”                      23 Nov 2023-01:49PM GMT                                         Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg: Migration numbers ‘absolutely extraordinary’                    Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said today’s record high net migration figures were “absolutely extraordinary”.  The former business secretary told BBC Radio 4 World at One programme: “The Conservatives, of which I am a member and supporter, promised in 2010 to get net migration down to the tens of thousands and instead it is running at what, 1.4million in two years.  “That is absolutely extraordinary. This is a phenomenally high level with economic consequences.”  Asked if he was in favour of introducing a cap on annual numbers, Sir Jacob said: “I am in favour of getting this number down very significantly. A cap is one way of doing it. You need to look at who you really, really need and you need to prioritise very carefully.”                      23 Nov 2023-01:35PM GMT                                         Starmer: Net migration figures 'shockingly high'                    Sir Keir Starmer said today’s net migration figures were “shockingly high”. The Labour leader said the high level of legal migration showed the Government had not done enough to provide the kind of skills employees need. Sir Keir told reporters on a visit to Essex: “That figure is shockingly high. It represents a failure, not just of immigration, but also of asylum and of the economy. “Because within that figure there’s a huge increase in work visas, which shows the Government hasn’t done what it needs to do on skills. “Within that number there are a rising number of asylum seekers and disclosure that the hotel bills are going up and up. “                      23 Nov 2023-01:26PM GMT                                         Migration numbers ‘unacceptable’, says Sir Iain Duncan Smith                     Sir Iain Duncan Smith branded today’s immigration figures “unacceptable” as he insisted it makes the success of the Government’s back-to-work push all the more important. Sir Iain, a former Conservative leader, told The Telegraph: “This is unacceptable in the long run for the UK, because it puts pressure on housing and support services, social services, massive pressure on those which creates problems for the UK’s existing citizens. “There are now 2.6m people who are out of work due to sickness and disability. It’s vital we start getting these people back to work, that will take the pressure off businesses to bring migrants in, and that will have a critical effect on reducing the level of migration. “This makes it all the more important that the Government now does whatever it takes to get on top also of illegal migration, particularly the boats, where already people are dying in the Channel. That is why the Rwanda scheme now needs to go ahead.”                      23 Nov 2023-01:07PM GMT                                         Pictured: Starmer and Reeves visit freeport in Essex                                          23 Nov 2023-12:48PM GMT                                         No10 defends visa approach                    Asked why the Government did not just simply issue fewer visas, the Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman said “it is important that we strike the right balance” so that when there are “short-term pressures” workers can be brought into areas such as health and care. “It is important that we take the time to consider carefully how we approach this, given the importance that a number of migrants can contribute – whether that’s to our health and care sector, or elsewhere to the wider economy. “We do believe there is further to go here and that’s why we’re keeping it under review.” He added: “We need to strike the right balance to ensure that people get the care they deserve, but equally that the system is set up correctly so it is prioritising those who benefit the UK.” People arriving on study-related visas accounted for the largest proportion (39%) of long-term immigration of non-EU nationals to the UK last year, at 378,000 people, up slightly from 320,000 in the previous 12 months.                      23 Nov 2023-12:39PM GMT                                         Government 'looking at other areas' where migration numbers can be reduced                    Downing Street has indicated that further measures to curb net migration could be introduced. “It is positive to have students and migrants coming here to study and work that contribute to UK society, that is the focus,” the Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman said. “What we do know is that the levels we have now are too high, they place an unsustainable pressure on communities and local councils. “That’s why we want to reduce them, and also because we do know that, sadly, there is still some abuse of the system. “That’s why we are cracking down on dependants of students and that’s why we are looking at other areas where we can make further reductions.”                      23 Nov 2023-12:18PM GMT                                         No10: 'Net migration remains far too high'                    Downing Street has said net migration is too high and promised to leave “no stone unturned” in tackling abuse of the visa system. The Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman said: “Net migration remains far too high. That’s why we are taking action to bring it down. That is what the British public expect. “That’s why in May we announced the toughest-ever action to reduce migration. That includes clamping down on the roughly 150,000 dependants of students who come into the UK every year and introducing an additional immigration health surcharge and raising visa costs. “We know this is predicted to lead to significant reductions. As we’ve seen today, the ONS figures show migration is now reducing year on year, but we believe there is much more to do. “Where the system is being abused, we will leave no stone unturned in rooting that out so companies and individuals cannot exploit our system.”                      23 Nov 2023-11:48AM GMT                                         Migration numbers 'completely unacceptable', says Tory MP                     Tory MP Jonathan Gullis said today’s net migration numbers are “completely unacceptable” and the Government needed to “take drastic action now” to bring them down. Mr Gullis said Rishi Sunak and James Cleverly “must listen to ideas” from Conservative MPs on how to bring the numbers down.  Today’s net migration figures from the ONS are completely unacceptable, and will rightly anger/frustrate the British people.We must take drastic action now to bring legal migration down, as well as do whatever we must to stop the boats.

Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said: “Today’s net migration statistics, including a 65 per cent increase in net migration for work, show the scale of utter Tory failure on immigration, asylum, and the economy. “These figures are driven by a 54 per cent increase in work visas and a 156 per cent increase in health and social care visas which prove the Conservatives’ abysmal record on skills, training and workforce planning, as they have run our economy into the ground.  “They are still failing to make changes Labour has called for to end the 20 per cent wage discount in the immigration system and to link it to training requirements.” She added: “The Tories have no grip on immigration and asylum and no plan for the economy.”                      23 Nov 2023-11:12AM GMT                                         Ex-Cabinet minister: ‘No public mandate for immigration on this scale’                    Responding to today’s net migration numbers (see the post below at 09.32), the former levelling up secretary Sir Simon Clarke told The Telegraph: “Today should strip away all illusion that the current settlement is working, and all those Government departments which continue to press for higher migration to the UK to plug short-term skills gaps need to be taken head on now by the Prime Minister. “There is no public mandate for immigration on this scale. It completely outstrips our ability to absorb new arrivals, both in terms of social cohesion and public services, and it’s also undermined UK productivity and wages to boost.” “Addressing both legal and illegal immigration is clearly fundamental to the credibility of the Government, and the time has long since passed for action rather than words.”                      23 Nov 2023-11:04AM GMT                                         Pictured: Chancellor Jeremy Hunt visits Airbus in north Wales this morning                                          23 Nov 2023-10:56AM GMT                                         Tackling high levels of migration 'do or die' for Conservatives, warn Tory MPs                    In a statement, the New Conservatives group of more than 20 MPs warned the surge in net migration (see the post below at 09.32) represented an existential threat to the Tory party and demanded an emergency package of measures to reduce it. “High rates of immigration depress wages, reduce investment in skills and technology, put unsustainable pressure on housing and public services, and threaten community cohesion,” they said. “The word ‘existential’ has been used a lot in recent days but this really is ‘do or die’ for our party. Each of us made a promise to the electorate. We don’t believe that such promises can be ignored  “The Government must propose, today, a comprehensive package of measures to meet the manifesto promise by the time of the next election. We will assess any such package and report publicly on whether it will meet the promise made to the electorate. The Prime Minister, Chancellor, and new Home Secretary must show that they stand by the promises on which we were elected to Parliament. We must act now.” The Tories pledged in their 2019 general election manifesto that “overall numbers will come down”.                       23 Nov 2023-10:51AM GMT                                         'I’m not sure I’d want to be the chancellor inheriting this situation in a year’s time'                    Paul Johnson said he was “not sure I’d want to be the chancellor inheriting this situation in a year’s time” as he gave his verdict on Jeremy Hunt’s tax and spend plans.  Concluding his remarks at an IFS briefing this morning, Mr Johnson said: “The fiscal forecasts have not in any real sense got better. Debt is not declining over time. Taxes are still heading to record levels. Spending is also due to stay high by historic standards, not least because of high debt interest payments.  “But those payments plus pressures on health and pension spending mean current plans are for some pretty serious cuts across other areas of public spending.  “How did Mr Hunt afford his tax cuts when real economic forecasts got no better? He banked additional revenue from higher inflation, and pencilled in harsher cuts to public spending. I’m not sure I’d want to be the chancellor inheriting this situation in a year’s time.”                      23 Nov 2023-10:48AM GMT                                         Historical significance of business tax cut ‘overblown’                     Jeremy Hunt’s claims about the significance of his business tax cut at yesterday’s Autumn Statement were “overblown”, the boss of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said.  Paul Johnson told a briefing this morning: “Mr Hunt has described making permanent full expensing for plant and machinery in corporation tax as ‘the biggest business tax cut in history’. That is, to put it kindly, is an overblown claim.  “It is expensive in the short to medium term, but the OBR yesterday confirmed our view that this is no more than a £3 billion a year tax cut in the longer run... this April’s increase in the rate of corporation tax from 19 to 25 per cent was an £18 billion a year tax rise.”                      23 Nov 2023-10:43AM GMT                                         IFS: Public services face ‘sharp cuts’ under Hunt’s spending plans                    Jeremy Hunt’s spending plans suggest there will have to be “sharp cuts” to some public services in the years ahead, Paul Johnson said this morning.  The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies told a briefing that Mr Hunt or his successor at the Treasury will not have the same “luxury” as George Osborne had when he cut the size of the state.  He said: “The Chancellor has pencilled in numbers that suggest he really wants to try to wrestle the size of the state back down towards where it was in 2019. Given the demands of servicing our debt, and presumably paying for more healthcare and pensions, achieving that will require sharp cuts in many areas of public spending.  “It would also result in a continued change in the shape of the state. We reckon that these numbers would imply day to day spending by the Department of Health and Social Care reaching 45 per cent of total resource DEL, up from 40 per cent pre-pandemic, and 25 per cent at the turn of the century.” He added: “That is one measure of the pain that would be inflicted on many other public services under these plans. George Osborne did manage to get the size of the state back down after the financial crisis. That was really painful. Doing it again will be more painful. Mr Osborne made his cuts after a decade of big spending increases. Mr Hunt, or his successor, if we take these numbers seriously, will have no such luxury.”                      23 Nov 2023-10:39AM GMT                                         Hunt or Labour successor face ‘one heck of a headache'                    Jeremy Hunt-or his Labour successor in the Treasury-will face “one heck of a headache” in the coming years as they are forced to take the “tough decisions” which are implied by the Autumn Statement, Paul Johnson said.  The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said: “Like his predecessors Mr Hunt has taken a modest improvement in the public finance forecasts and spent most of it. He has spent up front and told us he will meet his targets largely by unspecified fiscal restraint at some point in the future.  “What he will do in March if the OBR downgrades its forecasts we do not know... any such downgrading in March would leave him with quite a big headache.  “More importantly he or his successor is going to have one heck of a headache when it comes to making the tough decisions implied by this statement in a year or two’s time.”                      23 Nov 2023-10:35AM GMT                                         Cleverly: Government 'completely committed to reducing levels of legal migration'                     Home Secretary James Cleverly has now responded to today’s migration figures (see the post below at 09.32).  He said: “This figure is not showing a significant increase from last year’s figures and is largely in line with our own immigration statistics. “The Government remains completely committed to reducing levels of legal migration while at the same time focusing relentlessly on our priority of stopping the boats. “A priority we are already delivering on – cutting small boats arrivals by more than one third and dramatically increasing the number of asylum applications we process. This is not only the right thing to do, but what the British public want us to do.”                      23 Nov 2023-10:33AM GMT                                         IFS: Higher inflation ‘saved Chancellor’s bacon’                    Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said Jeremy Hunt’s “bacon” was “saved” yesterday by the Office for Budget Responsibility increasing its inflation forecasts.  He told a briefing on the Autumn Statement this morning: “Inflation may be coming down, but it was increases in the OBR’s forecast for inflation that saved the Chancellor’s bacon yesterday.  “That is largely what is driving higher tax revenues over the next few years despite a downgrade in real growth prospects, and it is doing so by more than enough to offset higher spending on debt interest and welfare benefits.”                      23 Nov 2023-10:31AM GMT                                         Reform leader: Tories should 'hand their heads in shame' over migration numbers                    The leader of Reform UK has said the Conservatives “should hang their heads in absolute shame” in the wake of a new net migration record. Richard Tice, whose insurgent Right-wing party has a policy of “net zero immigration” under which the number of people entering Britain could not exceed those leaving, said the record of the current Government is “appalling”. “We’ve got a new mass immigration record. The Tories have betrayed Brexit, they’ve lied to the British people and they should hang their heads in absolute shame,” he said. “The OBR confirmed yesterday that these huge net migration numbers are making us all poorer as the economy is flatlining, so everyone is worse off per head. “The Tories’ mass immigration is making us poorer and our public services worse and also changing the culture of Britain for the worse.”                      23 Nov 2023-10:18AM GMT                                         Ex-minister: PM must take 'immediate and massive action' on migration numbers                    Tory backbenchers are already warning Rishi Sunak that he must take “immediate and massive action” to reduce net migration in the wake of record figures published this morning.  Neil O’Brien, a former minister who left the Government in last week’s reshuffle, said: “In every election since 1992 we have promised to reduce migration.“Today’s extraordinary numbers mean the PM must now take immediate and massive action to do that to do just that.” The Telegraph understands the New Conservatives, a group of around 20 MPs predominantly in Red Wall constituencies, are set to issue a statement on the numbers later today.                      23 Nov 2023-09:55AM GMT                                         Households will be £1,900 poorer at end of current parliament                    The current parliament is on track to be the first ever in which household disposable incomes will be lower at the end than they were at the start, according to the Resolution Foundation. The think tank said that households will on average be £1,900 poorer at the end of this parliament than than they were at its start.  The Resolution Foundation published a bar chart showing how disposable incomes have changed during previous parliaments. And the 2019 onwards parliament is the only bar which is in the red, showing a fall.  Here's the graph that backs this up. Ouch. https://t.co/i3VTsxY9UI pic.twitter.com/C4cHm4c114 The think tank said that “this parliament is on track to be the first in which real household disposable incomes have fallen (by 3.1 per cent from December 2019 to January 2025)” and “households will on average be £1,900 poorer at the end of this parliament than at its start”. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “This parliament is set to achieve a truly grim new record: the first in which household incomes will be lower at its end than its beginning.”                      23 Nov 2023-09:32AM GMT                                         Net migration to UK hit new record high of 745,000                    Net migration to the UK was 672,000 in the year ending June 2023, according to new data published this morning by the Office for National Statistics.  Long-term immigration to the UK stood at 1.2million while emigration was 508,000.  The ONS said the net migration figure of 672,000 was slightly higher than the numbers for the year ending June 2022 when it was 607,000 but down from an updated estimate for the year ending December 2022 when it was 745,000.

He said Mr Hunt had performed a “wonderful balancing act” and workers are now “beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel” after the pressure put on the public finances by the Covid pandemic and the energy crisis.  Asked if Mr Hunt had done enough ahead of a general election next year, Lord Lamont told Sky News: “Given that it has got to be next year, the election, it is hardly surprising people speculate.  “But I don’t think you would describe this as an electioneering giveaway. It was very much a Budget for the longer term. Full marks to the Government.”                      23 Nov 2023-09:13AM GMT                                         Chancellor not reliant on ‘growth fairy’                     The Chancellor insisted his plan to grow the economy to pay for the services the UK needs is tangible and he is not reliant on a “growth fairy”.  Jeremy Hunt told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “I think it is completely wrong to say that I am kind of relying on some kind of growth fairy in the future.  “I actually took steps yesterday that are going to increase business investment in the economy by £20billion a year, 110 different measures.”                      23 Nov 2023-08:52AM GMT                                         ‘We didn’t choose the crowd pleasers’                    Jeremy Hunt said he had not chosen the biggest “crowd pleasers” in terms of tax cuts at yesterday’s Autumn Statement.  The Chancellor said he had prioritised moves which will boost jobs and and increase investment.  He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “We didn’t choose the crowd pleasers, the inheritance tax or income tax, the taxes on the tip of everyone’s tongue.  “We chose the tax cuts that are going to help businesses recruit more people because National Insurance means we will have about 100,000 more people in our national workforce because if you cut the tax on work you get more people working.  “And business investment tax relief which is going to help people like Airbus where I am now attract more investment into the UK.”                      23 Nov 2023-08:38AM GMT                                         Hunt: ‘No discussions’ with Sunak on election timing                     Jeremy Hunt insisted he has not discussed the timing of the next general election with Rishi Sunak-but did not rule out an early spring Budget. “I can confirm regarding the date of the election that I’ve had absolutely no discussions with the Prime Minister,” the Chancellor told LBC Radio. He said the National Insurance cut will be brought forward from April to take effect in January because “I want to bring help for families as soon as possible” as energy bills continue to rise. Asked if he could rule out February as the date for the next Budget, the senior Tory said: “I can’t rule out anything because I haven’t taken any decisions. Normally it’s in March, but we will make a decision at the appropriate time.”                      23 Nov 2023-08:26AM GMT                                         Hunt did not buy his wife a birthday present or a card                     Jeremy Hunt admitted he had not bought his wife a birthday present or even a card. The Chancellor, who had referred to his wife’s birthday at the start of his Autumn Statement yesterday, told LBC Radio: “I’m afraid I have not bought anything for my wife. I didn’t even get her a birthday card. I feel incredibly guilty. “What I did was publicly acknowledge her birthday to millions of people, which is something I haven’t done before. So, hopefully I will be able to make up for that at the weekend.”                      23 Nov 2023-08:15AM GMT                                         Labour won’t commit to unfreezing income tax thresholds                    Labour’s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the tax cuts announced in the Autumn Statement do not compensate for the fiscal drag pulling more people into paying tax. She suggested a Labour government would not immediately increase income tax thresholds, with a focus on growing the overall economy first. She told Times Radio: “In fact, the Autumn Statement confirmed yesterday that the tax burden on families despite this cut in National Insurance is going to continue to rise in each of the next five years. “So, it is some relief, but, to be honest, it doesn’t compensate for the fiscal drag.” Asked whether Labour would unfreeze thresholds, she declined to “make a commitment on tax without saying where the money is going to come from”.                      23 Nov 2023-08:08AM GMT                                         ‘Silly’ to view tax cuts as pre-election giveaway, says Hunt                    Jeremy Hunt said it was “silly” to think about his Autumn Statement tax cuts as a pre-election giveaway. The Chancellor told Sky News: “We haven’t chosen the most populist tax cuts. I think it’s silly to think about this in terms of the timing of the next election. “We’re trying to make the right decisions for the long-term growth of the British economy.”                      23 Nov 2023-08:03AM GMT                                         'We need a more productive state, not a bigger state'                    Jeremy Hunt said “we need a more productive state, not a bigger state” as he defended his decision not to increase public spending in line with inflation. He told Times Radio: “In the short run I am showing discipline with public spending. I think that is the right thing to do. We need a more productive state, not a bigger state.”  He added: “Yes, we do need to be disciplined in public spending in the short run.”                       23 Nov 2023-07:53AM GMT                                         Chancellor denies spending plans will mean worse public services                    Jeremy Hunt has denied his decision not to increase public spending in the coming years in line with inflation will result in worse public services. Asked the question on Times Radio, the Chancellor said: “No and the reason is very straightforward. If we want to have money to invest in the NHS and schools, in our armed forces over the longer term, you have to grow the economy.  “And I took decisions yesterday, the OBR say that within the short term, within the five year horizon, what I did yesterday and what I did in the spring will increase GDP by 0.5 per cent, that is very significant when you have a GDP the size of the UK’s.  “But over the longer run they will increase our long term growth because it is an extra £20billion of investment every single year that I am generating from the 110 measures that I took. That is the only way in the longer run that you can fund the cost of an ageing population.”                      23 Nov 2023-07:44AM GMT                                         Pictured: Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron visits Israel this morning                                          23 Nov 2023-07:42AM GMT                                         Chancellor defends decision to freeze income tax thresholds                     Jeremy Hunt defended his decision last year to extend a freeze on income tax thresholds.  Told that because of the effect of “fiscal drag” that specific move was making many people poorer, the Chancellor told Times Radio: “I had to take a very difficult decision to extend the freeze on thresholds a year ago, amongst other tax rises.  “I have been completely open. But I think it was the right thing to do to help people in the pandemic and in the energy crisis.  “But the reason I chose the specific tax cuts I did yesterday is because it is going to help businesses to grow and they aren’t the most populist tax cuts, they are the ones that will make the biggest difference to pour long term competitiveness.”                      23 Nov 2023-07:38AM GMT                                         Hunt says Autumn Statement tax cuts were just a 'start'                    Jeremy Hunt suggested tax cuts announced at the Autumn Statement were just a “start” as the Chancellor hinted at further giveaways before the next general election. He told Times Radio: “I can make a start, and that is what I did yesterday, in reducing the tax burden but I have chosen to do it in a way that is going to grow the economy.  “I am at the Airbus factory in North Wales which makes the wings for all the Airbus aeroplanes around the whole world and they say it is going to make their job easier because of this tax cut on capital allowance.  “It is not something that families have particularly heard of up and down the country but it will make us grow more.  “Better paid jobs, higher living standards in the future and that is the long term way that we fund our public services like the NHS and I hope are able to reduce the tax burden still further in the future.” Load-Date: November 23, 2023  End of Document
