   Brexit checks 'to cost £380m' Daily Record and Sunday Mail May 22, 2024 Wednesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2024 Copyright © 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 2 Length: 148 words Byline: ANDREW QUINN Body   BORDER checks caused by Brexit could cost Scotland £380million, the SNP has claimed. A report from the National Audit Office forecast that more than £4.7billion of public money will be spent on post-Brexit border controls. The SNP has said our share of this bill, based on population, would be £378,803,479. The party claimed this means the Brexit border checks are set to cost each Scot £69.35, or each household £148.55. This is more than the £41 average cost of a UK household's weekly shop. The SNP's EU and EU Accession spokesperson Alyn Smith said: "Scotland's households and businesses are paying a heavy price for this broken, Brexit Britain. We never voted for Brexit and we never voted for the Westminster government." A UK Government spokesperson said: "Our borders strategy introduces essential, risk-based checks to protect the UK from potentially devastating pests and diseases."
