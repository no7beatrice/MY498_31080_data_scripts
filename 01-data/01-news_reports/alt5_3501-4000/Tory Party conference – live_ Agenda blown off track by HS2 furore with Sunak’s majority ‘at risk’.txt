   Tory Party conference – live: Agenda blown off track by HS2 furore with Sunak’s majority ‘at risk’ The Independent (United Kingdom) October 2, 2023 Monday 4:25 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: UK POLITICS,UK; Version:50 Length: 6868 words Byline: Maryam Zakir-Hussain and Andy Gregory Highlight: West Midlands mayor Andy Street holds furious impromptu press conference urging Sunak not to ‘cancel the future’ Body   The second day of the Conservative Party  conference has been overshadowed by furious row over Rishi Sunak ’s plans to delay the Manchester  leg of HS2  – just weeks after The Independent first revealed secret talks between him and chancellor Jeremy Hunt  to scrap the route. The decision to delay the leg by seven years means plans for the rail line to stretch beyond Birmingham  have been kicked into the long grass, The Independent understands, in a move that has sparked fury among northern business leaders  and politicians, including the most senior Tory outside Westminster, Andy Street.  The West Midlands mayor called an extraordinary impromptu press conference on Monday evening, in which he urged the PM not to “cancel the future”, and refused to rule out resigning over the matter. Meanwhile, further infighting – spearheaded by his brief predecessor Liz Truss – threatened to put Mr Sunak’s majority at risk, as some 60 Tory MPs signed up to her pro-growth group of rebels demanding tax reductions this year to “Make Britain Grow Again”.                      Key Points                                                                ‘Cancelling the future’: Tory mayor Andy Street holds extraordinary press conference on HS2                       Jeremy Hunt speech overshadowed by news he will scrap HS2 Manchester leg                       Hunt announces freeze to expansion of civil service                       Liz Truss calls for tax cuts in call to ‘Make Britain Grow Again'                       Rishi Sunak’s majority at risk as 60 MPs sign up to Truss rebel group                       How The Independent revealed Sunak’s plan to cut HS2                                                              Priti Patel and Nigel Farage dance the night away                    Some say the Tory conference has been overshadowed by the scrapping of HS2-but have you seen this video of Priti Patel dancing with Nigel Farage? Now, that’s something...                       08:24 , Maryam Zakir-HussainRishi Sunak clashes with BBC presenter as he refuses to answer HS2 question                      PM says people don’t care ‘how much money I have'                     Rishi Sunak said he did not believe voters care about how much money he has, amid claims and criticisms that his wealth means he is “out of touch”. The prime minister, who with his wife Akshata Murty has an estimated net worth of £529 million, faced questions during a set of broadcast interviews about whether his wealth made it difficult for voters to connect with him. He told Times Radio: “I think what people want from their prime ministers and their leaders is to do things that are going to make a difference to their lives. “I don’t think people are as interested in how much money is in my bank account. They’re interested in what I’m doing for them.” Mr Sunak’s wealth makes him one of the richest men ever to become prime minister, but it has seen critics and opponents argue that he has little understanding of the pressures on ordinary voters battling inflation.                      Rishi Sunak insists the Tories are having a ‘great’ conference despite HS2 speculation                    Rishi Sunak rejected a suggestion that the row over HS2 had overshadowed the Conservative Party conference and that the handling of the announcement had been poor. He told BBC Breakfast: “I don’t think that. Actually we’re having a great conference.” Pressed again, he said: “The mood here is great.” He then proceeded to list all the other Government announcements made at the conference in Manchester this week.                      Rishi Sunak boasts he is a Northern MP amid HS2                    Rishi Sunak was boasting his northern credentials in a spiky interview on BBC Breakfast after being accused of giving up on the HS2 line to Manchester Asked if he can be trusted by The North if he doesn’t link the high-speed railway to the great cities, he hit back: “Look I’m a northern MP. When I’m lucky enough to go home from London I get to go home from North Yorkshire. “As chancellor I created freeports across The North including in Teeside which is now attracting billions in investments and jobs.”He stressed: “I moved the Treasury to Darlington.”                      Rishi Sunak denies giving up on HS2                    Rishi Sunak got his own catchphrase “spades in the ground” wrong as he denied giving up on HS2 stretch to Manchester in a heated breakfast interview. Mr Sunak said: “The way I approach this job I take a look at the facts and take the time to make the right decision on behalf of the country.” Asked on BBC Breakfast if he had given up on the railway, he said: “Absolutely not, we have got spades on the ground on HS2 as we speak.” He added: “I know there is lots of speculation. I’m not going to be forced into a premature decision because it will be good for someone’s TV programme. I want to make the right decision for the country.  “What I want to do is make the right decision for the country. This is an enormous amount of people’s money, taxpayers’ money, everybody watching, billions and billions of pounds. “We shouldn’t be rushed into things like that. What people would expect from me is to take the time to go over it properly and make sure we make the right long-term decisions for the country.”                      Simon Calder: Cutting off the North from HS2 is a national disgrace                    Vandalism on the railway can result in a life sentence and an unlimited fine for the perpetrator. But the act of national vandalism that is the decision to disconnect the North completely from HS2  will mean a life sentence of inadequate rail services for tens of millions of travellers across England, Wales and Scotland. No serious figure in the rail industry can believe what the government is contemplating: ripping up the primary function of HS2. The line as conceived (and as recently as two weeks ago, guaranteed by a future Labour government) is designed to connect Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Nottingham with Birmingham at 21st-century speeds. The onward link to London is intended to provide vital extra capacity on all north-south services, with the valuable side effects of slashing journey times and tempting travellers from road to rail, our travel correspondent, Simon Calder writes. Cutting off the North from HS2 is a national disgrace                      Scrapping HS2 leg would make line ‘a monument of the places Whitehall cares about’                    Andy Burnham has described reports that the Manchester leg of HS2 will be shelved as “profoundly depressing”. Speaking at a fringe event at the Conservative Party conference, the Manchester mayor said: “This will be remembered as the conference when they pulled the plug on us. “What gives them the right to treat people here in Greater Manchester and the north of England as second-class citizens? We’re growing faster than the UK economy. We’re a success story and then, behind you, you have got people working against you.” Mr Burnham added: “If this railway goes from outer London through the Home Counties and ends up in Birmingham, it will be a monument of the places Whitehall cares about.”                      ‘Time to roll up our sleeves,’ says Hunt                    Concluding his keynote speech earlier at the Tory conference, chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: “It’s easy to support higher growth, better public services and lower taxes. Harder to make it happen. “In Britain today, there’s only one party prepared to make those difficult decisions. “Our party and our Prime Minister, whose diligence and tenacity have given us the Windsor Framework, the Atlantic Declaration, the Trans Pacific trade deal, and the NHS workforce plan, whose own life story shows just what’s possible with education, aspiration and hard work. “His story and our story: more growth, more jobs, more doctors, more nurses, better schools, less poverty, less crime. “It’s time to roll up our sleeves, take on the declinists and watch the British economy prove the doubters wrong.”                      Full report: HS2 northern leg scrapped – weeks after The Independent revealed Rishi Sunak’s plan to axe it                    Rishi Sunak is set to use the Tory party conference to confirm he has scrapped the northern leg of HS2 – weeks after The Independent revealed he had held secret talks about axeing the project.                      The Independent understands that the route north of Birmingham will be shelved for seven years in a bid to ditch the project in the long term – a move that has sparked fury among northern mayors and business bosses. A source close to government discussions said Mr Sunak was most likely to make the announcement in his speech on Wednesday, though it could now be brought forward to Tuesday.                      The Independent understands that the decision to leave open the possibility that HS2 could be revived by the end of the decade was only made after this publication’s initial exclusive provoked a furious backlash and spooked No 10. The move completely overshadowed the second day of the party’s conference in Manchester, with chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s speech left largely ignored. Our politics and policy correspondentsAdam Forrest andJon Stone have the full report: HS2 northern leg scrapped – weeks after The Independent revealed Sunak plan to axe it                      ‘Real concerns’ over scrapping HS2 leg, warns top Tory                    Scrapping HS2’s northern leg would send a message to international investors that the UK “can’t be relied on” to see commitments through, Tory foreign affairs committee chair Alicia Kearns has told Sky News. “It is difficult because from everything you see – you know, I haven’t been told anything as a Conservative MP – but it does feel like the writing’s on the wall. I see it from both sides.  “Look, from my perspective, they started the building at the wrong end of the country. The fact the costs just keep getting out of control, which I think there’s a lot of questions for the management company there, all the way through to just some of the ways it has been handled.  “But at the same time, the message it sends to international investors – that once we commit to something we can’t be relied on to see that commitment through – I think that’s a real issue there, and I agree entirely. “It doesn’t affect my constituency, but there are real concerns.”                      Smartphones ‘one of biggest issues’ facing teachers, says education secretary                    Grappling with smartphones is one of the “biggest issues” facing teachers, education secretary Gillian Keegan has said as she pushed for devices to be banned in schools. Addressing the Conservative Party conference on Monday afternoon, Ms Keegan said: “Today, one of the biggest issues facing children and teachers is grappling with the impact of smartphones in our schools. “The distraction, the disruption, the bullying. We know that teachers are struggling with their impact and we know that they need support. “So, today we are recognising the amazing work that many schools have done in banning mobile phones and we are announcing that we will change guidance so that all schools will follow their lead.” But Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said: “If the government introduces blanket bans that are unenforceable, this will make the behaviour crisis worse, not better.”                      In Focus | Sunak is in a race against time to show what he stands for                                         Our columnist and former political editor                       Andrew Grice                     has this analysis:                    “Rishi has been prime minister for almost a year, but we still don’t know what he stands for,” said one senior Conservative MP who backed Rishi Sunak for the party leadership. “He cannot wait a moment longer to set out what ‘Sunakism’ is and what another five years of it would mean.” That even Sunak’s supporters are getting impatient is a worrying sign his first Tory conference as party leader gets under way. What’s interesting is that the prime minister’s inner circle does not dispute this diagnosis; they want the conference to provide booster rockets to the relaunch he began 10 days ago by ditching some net zero measures. “I have made my decision: we are going to change,” Sunak said then. The conference, with a slogan of “long-term decisions for a brighter future” might bring announcements on crime, education and public service reforms to draw new “dividing lines” with Labour. Crucially, Sunak will need to offer voters a sense of hope and better times ahead after the cost-of-living crisis. Sunak is in a race against time to show what he stands for                      Barclay to announce new medical schools – as doctors’ strike continues                    Health secretary Steve Barclay will announce three new medical schools to boost the NHS workforce – as doctors across England take their largest strike action so far, with a three-day walkout on Monday leaving Chriastmas Day-levels of cover in hospitals. Mr Barclay will announce new medical schools at the University of Worcester, the University of Chester and Brunel University in Uxbridge, west London. They will each offer at least 50 undergraduate places a year from September 2024. Existing medical schools will also offer at least 55 more places from that date, with 35 more at the University of Central Lancashire and 20 at Edge Hill University. It is part of a plan to double the number of medical school places to 15,000 by 2031.                      Plenty of private renters are ‘not weed-smoking bad people’ in ‘crack dens’, says housing minister                    There are “plenty of young people” privately renting their homes who are “not weed-smoking bad people” or in “crack dens” and “smashing up the neighbourhood”, housing minister Rachel Maclean has said as she defended strengthening renters’ rights. Speaking at a fringe conference event hosted by the Bright Blue think tank and the National Residential Landlords Association, the minister was addressing concerns some landlords have over the Renters (Reform) Bill, which seeks to strengthen protections for renters and would abolish section 21 so-called no-fault evictions. She said: “A lot of people have said to me, ‘Rachel, why are you doing this? It’s not Conservative. There’s going to be nobody, no Conservative voters are going to vote for this’. And I say to them ... I have got four children, all of whom are in their late 20s and 30s, they are all professionals, they are all earning, they all vote Conservative. “Three of them live in the PRS (private rented sector) in London, one lives in the PRS in Worcester. I’m afraid it’s absolutely rubbish to say that these are not Conservative voters.” She added: “There are plenty of young people who are in the PRS who are not weed-smoking bad people, you know, in gangs and, you know, crack dens and everything else ... and smashing up the neighbourhood. There’s lots of decent people, hard-working people in the PRS, and we need to do the right thing for them.”                      Tory grassroots would vote Farage in as party leader given the choice, journalist suggests                    The founder of the ConservativeHome website has said he is “convinced” that the Tory grassroots would vote for Nigel Farage as party leader if they had the choice.                      I walked into Conference earlier with @Nigel_Farage.  He got quite the reception.

The government, the prime minister and the ministers leading on the decisions need to reach out to us and need to have that conversation, because we won’t be prepared to sit back time and time again, and hear promise after promise, where ultimately it’s our residents at the receiving end and our residents that are being let down.“So, the message is clear.

Our door’s open.”Theresa May warns against interpreting Uxbridge by-election result as ‘anti-environment’ voteMonday 2 October 2023 21:51 , Andy Gregory Former prime minister Theresa May offered a strong defence of net zero policies as she warned her party not to interpret last summer’s Uxbridge by-election as an “anti-environment” vote.Speaking at a Conservative Environment Network reception in Manchester, she said: “A lot has been made of the result of the Uxbridge by-election. That was not won on an anti-environment ticket. It was won on an anti-Ulez ticket.“We must ensure that we are keeping -keeping -our commitment to net zero, as the Government is. We recognise and must understand that the worst thing that could happen would be to give Labour the lead on net zero.“That’s not in our party’s interest. But, more than that, it is not in the interest of this country.”‘Laughable’ to suggest government can’t build rail line from London to Manchester, says Tory mayorMonday 2 October 2023 21:14 , Andy Gregory West Midlands mayor Andy Street has said it is “laughable” to suggest that the government cannot build a railway from London to Manchester.“This is a project that I think is of national significance for generations. We’ve argued for it for years and indeed successive governments have supported it,” the Tory mayor told Sky News. “And now the prime minister could be on the edge of scrapping it. I get he’s got a really, really big problem. The costs are significantly above-budget, you might even say out of control. But that does not need to lead to scrapping.Citing a “new offer” by the private sector he said: “At the moment this is being done very much as a statist project, all the costs are taken by the public Exchequor, it’s all on the balance sheet. “That’s not necessarily how it has to be – we’ve not brought in the expertise from the private sector, who say ‘we can reduce this cost, we can potentially get it paid for in other ways potentially’. That’s how it’s done in other countries.”He added: “As a G7 country, you're telling me we can't build a railway from London to Manchester? It's laughable, frankly.”"You're telling me we can't build a railway from London to Manchester?

Even if he delivers a lacklustre speech, or gets heckled, his position should be assured this close to a general election.Theresa May, whose cough-addled oration in 2017 was delivered against a disintegrating backdrop and interrupted by a prankster handing her a P45, managed to hang on for another 18 months.Despite wild talk about votes of confidence, and Priti Patel placing herself at the head of a grassroots “peasants’ revolt”, the prime minister is not likely to be going anywhere quite yet. But that doesn’t mean that others aren’t looking to the post-Sunak future, and going on manoeuvres...Our associate editorSean O’Gradytakes a look at who’s jostling:The race to replace Rishi Sunak has begun.

Appearing to question the decision, she added: “What kind of work have they done, what kind of analysis, what kind of assumptions?”Ms Patel also did not rule out running for the Tory leadership. “I don’t know what will happen. I simply don’t know what will happen. What I do want, though, is for us to win the general election. And, you know, I’ll play my part in that.

She added: “Let’s stop taxing and banning things.”Her close ally Ranil Jayawardena MP said the Conservative Growth Group, which had thought to number around 30, had grown to include 60 MPs – roughly the same size as Mr Sunak’s majority in the Commons.Former home secretary Priti Patel, who joined the Truss rally on Monday along with Jacob Rees-Mogg, told delegates: “We cannot be timid any more, we cannot be risk averse and we cannot accept the status quo.”Rishi Sunak’s majority at risk as 60 Tory MPs join Liz Truss group Andy Burnham warns England’s ‘reputation’ is at stake over HS2Monday 2 October 2023 19:29 , Jon Stone Speaking at an industry reception in Manchester hosted by the High Speed Rail Group, Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham urged Rishi Sunak to save the HS2 project.“There’s a lot at stake here. Our reputation is at stake as a country,” he said.“It is a strange feeling having people holed up in hotel rooms taking decisions that will have monumental implications for the future of this country.“If that plug is pulled, in effect, it’s a statement that the north of England economy is going to be smaller in the 21st century than it might otherwise have been. It’s a message to here that they are second class citizens.”How West Midlands mayor Andy Street’s extraordinary statement concludedMonday 2 October 2023 19:17 , Andy Gregory“So in conclusion, my suggestion to the Prime Minister tonight as he considers all these rumours is that there is a choice in front of him. “The choice, very stark, either as the rumours say go on [and] cancel Euston, cancel to Manchester, but you will be turning your back on an opportunity to level up, a once in a generation opportunity.“You will indeed be damaging our international reputation as a place to invest. The alternative is to put with us, engage with us fully embrace the private sector. “Hear out what they could do to find a way that we can still build this national piece of infrastructure in a way which we can afford and at a cost which we're all comfortable with.”Andy Street doesn’t rule out resigningMonday 2 October 2023 19:03 , Andy Gregory West Midlands’ Tory mayor Andy Street did not rule out resigning over the HS2 decision at his angry impromptu press conference.

Every single taxpayer in the UK has got to pay for this project and it’s spiralling out of control.“Now, I’m easy with it. If it goes ahead, I’ll support it, if they scrap it, I’ll support that, either way, but we need a decision and we need it very, very soon, because, like I say, the costs each week are out of control.”Mr Anderson, MP for Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, said: “I think if you gave the public a choice, especially in where I live, between high-speed rail and better buses and tram services and local regional railways, they’ll go for the latter, obviously.”Scrapping HS2 leg ‘desperate act of dying government’, says Andy BurnhamMonday 2 October 2023 18:30 , Andy Gregory Andy Burnham has told a press conference that axing the Manchester leg of HS2 would be the “desperate act of a dying government”.Mr Burnham said: “This was the parliament when the north of England was being levelled up with the rest of the country and here we are at the end of it.“If they’re about to pull the plug, that would just be a desperate act of a dying government with nowhere left to go. At the very least they should preserve the decision for the next government so they can deliver what the north of England has been promised.”In a message to the government, the Greater Manchester mayor said: “Don’t in any way go away from Manchester and underestimate the anger that is building around in this city and the towns around it, and across the north, about the way the north of England is being treated.

But he said to scrap the project completely would “damage our reputation as a place to invest”.“We must not give up. We must stay the course.

But the act of national vandalism that a decision to disconnect the north completely from HS2 will mean a life sentence of inadequate rail services for tens of millions of travellers across England, Wales and Scotland.Surely there will be one cohort of winners from this world-beating example of how not to run a giant infrastructure project: travellers between Birmingham and London? Yet they comprise the one group of intercity rail passengers who currently enjoy a well-served, highly competitive market.Avanti West Coast and West Midlands Trains compete on the West Coast main line between Birmingham New Street and London Euston. In addition, Chiltern Railways has – though long-term vision and investment – transformed the line between London Marylebone and Birmingham Moor Street into a viable and valuable intercity link.Rivalry is so intense that seven trains an hour depart each way between the two cities. The very last people who need a high speed link between Birmingham and London are, ironically, people who travel between Birmingham and London.You can read Simon’s analysis in full here:Cutting off the north from HS2 is a national disgrace Tories have broken 15 promises on animal welfare since election, says RSPCAMonday 2 October 2023 17:29 , Andy Gregory The government has backtracked on 15 promises to improve animal welfare, including some from its own election manifesto, new analysis claims.The broken pledges include a ban on live exports, a crackdown on puppy smuggling, curbing sheep worrying and outlawing foie gras imports.Commitments to write high animal-welfare standards into post-Brexit trade deals and to consult on ending cages for farm animals have also been dropped, according to the RSPCA.My colleagueJane Daltonhas more details here:Tories have broken 15 promises on animal welfare since election, says RSPCA Covid-19 bereaved ‘haven’t had access to Boris Johnson’s phone messages’Monday 2 October 2023 17:14 , Andy Gregory Lawyers have alleged that families who lost loved ones during the Covid-19 pandemic have been denied access to “crucial material” given to the public inquiry into the crisis, reportsElla Pickover.Law firm Broudie Jackson Canter, which is representing the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group, said it has not been given access to former prime minister Boris Johnson’s phone messages.The device he used during key periods of the coronavirus pandemic is expected to contain messages relating to the ordering of three lockdowns in 2020.

I think we need to look again at the net zero programme. I’m not convinced we’re going to get that, but let’s wait and see,” he told a fringe event at Tory conference.Analysis may ‘never’ be able to show whether Brexit harmed UK economy in long-term, says FrostMonday 2 October 2023 16:28 , Andy GregoryOur policy correspondentJon Stonereports from Manchester:The politician who negotiated Britain’s Brexit deal has said it would never be possible to say whether it it had damaged UK economic performance or not.Speaking at a fringe event at Conservative Party conference in Manchester, Lord Frost said there was “so much going on” that his work simply could not be assessed in isolation. “I don’t think there will ever ... it’s very difficult to disentangle all the causality of this,” he told Tory delegates at the annual meeting.“I don’t think we’ll ever get to a point in say 2030, where we’ll be able to say Britain is underperforming and it’s purely because of the nature of the trade deal. There’s so much going on and such an analytical difficulty in assessing it.”But Lord Frost insisted that “nothing has happened to global Britain” and that the “general perception that [UK trade performance] has been bad since Brexit” was wrong.“I don’t think the figures bear that out at all,” he said. “I don’t think the argument that there has been a change in trade patterns of levels or a hit to EU exports is really borne out by the figures.”When it was pointed out that one in 8 small businesses had told the Federation of Small Businesses they had given up exporting to the EU because of new trade bureaucracy, Lord Frost said he did not believe there had been no effect – but that it was small“I think one has to keep these things in proportion. I personally have always said that there’s a small, short-run hit from leaving the customs union and the single market,” he said.Khan: Cutting HS2 'catastrophic failure'Monday 2 October 2023 16:09 , Archie Mitchell Sadiq Khan has said cutting HS2 would represent a “catastrophic failure” by the government.The London mayor said homes and businesses along the route have now been “destroyed for nothing”, while travelling between Birmingham and London will “take longer than existing routes”.Writing on Twitter/X, Mr Khan said: “Cutting back HS2 would be a catastrophic failure. Birmingham to London taking longer than existing routes. Euston homes and businesses destroyed for nothing. Wasting a huge opportunity for new jobs and housing. Nothing new for the North.”Cutting back HS2 would be a catastrophic failure.Birmingham to London taking longer than existing routes.Euston homes and businesses destroyed for nothing.Wasting a huge opportunity for new jobs and housing.Nothing new for the North.— Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) October 2, 2023                      Smart people ‘don’t run away and cancel’ HS2, says business chief                    Juergen Maier, vice-chairman of Northern Powerhouse Partnership and former Siemens boss, said the government was presiding over a “shambles” by allowing the uncertainty to go on for weeks.  He told The Independent that scrapping the northern leg was “economically irresponsible”, adding: “We are letting future generations down. Complex infrastructure projects always hit some problems. Smart people get round the table to solve them – they don’t run away and cancel.”                      Labour reaction to HS2                    Louise Haigh MP, Labour’s Shadow Transport Secretary, commenting on reports and then denial of a government decision on HS2, said: “This fiasco shows the Conservatives are too divided and too distracted to take this country forward.  “After weeks of chaos and indecision on the biggest infrastructure project in the country, Rishi Sunak’s relaunch is now coming off the rails.  “This shambolic conference is showcasing precisely why working people cannot afford five more years of the Conservatives.”                      Gillian Keegan confirms government’s plan for ban of mobile phones in schools                    Gillian Keegan has confirmed the government’s plans for a blanket ban of mobile phones in schools, describing them as one of the “biggest issues” facing teachers. The education secretary told the Conservative Party conference: “Today, one of the biggest issues facing children and teachers is grappling with the impact of smartphones in our schools. “The distraction, the disruption, the bullying. We know that teachers are struggling with their impact and we know that they need support. “So, today we are recognising the amazing work that many schools have done in banning mobile phones and we are announcing that we will change guidance so that all schools will follow their lead.”                      ‘If you tell the international investment community you are going to do something, you bloody well have to do it'                    West Midlands mayor Andy Street has urged Rishi Sunak not to scrap HS2’s northern leg, despite reports a decision has been made.  Weeks after The Independent revealed the second phase of the high speed rail project would be scrapped, Mr Street said the PM “bloody well has to” keep it.  At an event on the fringes of Conservative Party Conference, Mr Street, the most powerful Tory outside Westminster, said: “Certainty is critical, it is an absolutely fundamental point and it is what drives investment.”  Mr Street highlighted the success of last year’s Birmingham Commonwealth Games, which he said was predicated on eight years of infrastructure investment.  The certainty was “utterly consistent” across political parties, “and that is what gave investors confidence,” he added.  “The parallels with HS2 are blindingly obvious,” Mr Street said.                      How The Independent revealed Sunak’s plan to cut HS2 -and how the government reacted                    The northern leg of HS2  has been scrapped  due to spiralling costs weeks after The Independent revealed the prime minister and chancellor were in talks about shelving it. The Manchester leg of the high-speed rail project has been pushed back by at least seven years, The Independent understands. The revelation comes after The Independent first revealed top-level talks were taking place between Rishi Sunak  and Jeremy Hunt  about whether to scrap parts of the high-speed rail project HS2,  on 13 September. The much-delayed and overbudget scheme was for a line linking some of the country’s largest cities, intended to connect London, the Midlands and the north of England, with construction split into three phases. How The Independent revealed Sunak’s plan to cut HS2 -and how the government reacted                      Ministers say no cabinet meeting called over HS2                                           Kate Devlin                     , our politics and Whitehall editor, reports from Manchester:                    Cabinet ministers say no cabinet meeting has been called over HS2 (yet).  The prime minister held an emergency meeting of his cabinet a few weeks ago, just before he made his announcement on net zero.  There is a feeling that he might call one during the Tory conference in Manchester -to rubber stamp HS2.  But cabinet ministers say that there is nothing currently in their diary.  Watch this space.                      HS2 route mapped as northern leg to Manchester to be scrapped                    After years of setbacks, controversy and spiralling costs, the northern leg of the long-awaited HS2  rail project has been scrapped. The Manchester leg of the high-speed project has been pushed back until at least 2029, effectively kicking it into the long grass. It comes after The Independent exclusively revealed  that Rishi Sunak was considering ditching plans for the route from Birmingham to Manchester. A source close to government discussions said that the prime minister would announce the northern leg of HS2 had been scrapped at the Tory conference – mostly likely in his Wednesday speech, though it could be brought forward to Tuesday.
