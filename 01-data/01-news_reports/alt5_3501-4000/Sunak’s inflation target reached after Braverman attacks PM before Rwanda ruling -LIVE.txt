   Sunak’s inflation target reached after Braverman attacks PM before Rwanda ruling -LIVE The Independent (United Kingdom) November 15, 2023 Wednesday 6:30 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: HOME NEWS,UK; Version:2 Length: 8499 words Byline: Athena Stavrou,Matt Mathers and Adam Forrest Highlight: Former home secretary accuses PM of ‘betrayal’ and failing to deliver on key policies Body   Inflation has fallen to 4.6 per cent in October, putting the government on track to meet its target to halve inflation by the end of the year.  The latest UK inflation figures show a sharp slowdown in the annual pace of price rises, easing pressure on the Bank of England to increase interest rates. This comes as Suella Braverman launched a blistering attack on the prime minister  last night after being sacked as home secretary  for a series of controversial and highly inflammatory remarks about homeless people and the police. Ms Braverman accused the prime minister of “betrayal” and failing to deliver on key policy areas such as illegal migration, in an explosive letter  designed to cause him maximum damage. She also accused Mr Sunak, who she described as “weak”, of leaving the country in an “impossible position” with no “credible Plan B” just hours before a crunch court ruling on his flagship Rwanda plan. The Supreme Court will on Wednesday decide  whether or not the government’s controversial plan to send migrants to Rwanda, which has been under review for 18 months, is lawful. Ongoing legal battles have meant there have yet to be any migrants sent to the East African nation under the policy.                       Key Points                                                                Supreme Court to rule on Rwanda plan                       Braverman accuses Sunak of ‘betrayal’ in brutal letter                       Keir Starmer to stage showdown vote with Labour’s Gaza rebels                                                              Labour MPs ‘not given free vote’ on ceasefire                    Shadow cabinet minister Pat McFadden stressed that Labour MPs will not be given a free vote on the SNP’s call for a ceasefire. Pressed on what consequences there would be for shadow ministers who rebel, he told Sky News: “Like every frontbencher, I serve at the pleasure of the leader. “Who is on the frontbench is a matter for him and the chief whip.” According to the Daily Telegraph, Sir Keir is preparing to fire those who vote in favour of the SNP’s motion, should Sir Lindsay put it to a division. A Labour spokesman would not confirm the reports, but said: “We’re not going to be engaging with the party political game-playing by the SNP in Parliament.”                      Supreme Court Rwanda judgment expected this morning                    The Supreme Court will deliver its judgment on whether Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy is lawful this morning, after Suella Braverman warned he has no credible back-up to “stop the boats”. A ruling on whether or not the government’s controversial plan to send migrants to Rwanda, which has been under review for 18 months, is expected at around 10am.  Ongoing legal battles have meant there have yet to be any migrants sent to the East African nation under the policy.                       Government to back ‘difficult decisions’ to further lower inflation                    Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said the Government would back the Bank of England’s “difficult decisions” on using interest rates to further lower inflation. He told broadcasters: “The Government has a very important role in bringing down inflation, because we are responsible for the whole fiscal context – a year ago, markets were worried that borrowing and debt were out of control. “We took difficult decisions to bring that borrowing and debt down. “As a result of that, we made it easier for the Bank of England to do their job. “But we will continue to support them with the difficult decisions that they take on interest rates, because the job is not yet done.” Mr Hunt, who will deliver the Government’s autumn statement next week, said that although the UK is “beginning to win the battle against inflation” there was “lots more work to do”.                      UK ‘turned a corner’ as inflation rates drop                    An economist has said the latest inflation figures suggest the UK has turned a corner in it’s “battle” against inflation. “This dramatic drop suggests that the UK has turned the corner in its battle against soaring inflation, particularly given the fall in core inflation, which indicates that underlying price pressures are also easing,” Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said. He added that while inflation targets have been made, this is not due to Government action. He added: “While the Prime Minister has achieved his target to halve inflation this year, this owes more to the downward pressure on prices from falling energy costs and rising interest rates than any Government action.”                      Government celebration ‘cold comfort’ for working people, Lib Dem says                    The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Sarah Olney said the prime minister’s celebration would be “cold comfort” for “hard-working” people. “Rishi Sunak congratulating himself over today’s figures will be cold comfort for all the hard-working people still bearing the brunt of this Conservative chaos,” she said. “For months on end, people across the country have been watching as their pay cheque gets squeezed from all sides, draining every spare penny. From the ever-increasing cost of the weekly shop to skyrocketing mortgage payments.” She added that it was essential that the Government use next week’s autumn statement to properly help families and pensioners.                      Sunak attributes inflation figures to “hard decisions and fiscal discipline”                    Rishi Sunak said “hard decisions and fiscal discipline” by his Government had contributed to the fall in inflation. “Inflation works like a tax. It eats into the pound in your pocket, affecting the price of your food shop, your mortgage, the size of your pension pot,” the Prime Minister said. “This is why halving inflation has been my number one priority. “Getting it down has involved hard decisions and fiscal discipline. “Official figures released this morning confirm we have halved inflation, meeting the first of the five priorities I set out at the beginning of this year. “While it is welcome news that prices are no longer rising as quickly, we know many people are continuing to struggle, which is why we must stay the course to continue to get inflation all the way back down to 2%.”                      Shadow chancellor says Government should not be ‘popping Champagne'                    Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the Government should not be “popping Champagne corks” about the fall in the rate of inflation, with people still struggling with the cost of living. “The fall in inflation will come as some relief for families struggling with the cost of living,” she said. “But now is not the time for Conservative ministers to be popping champagne corks and patting themselves on the back. “After 13 years of economic failure under the Conservatives, working people are worse off with higher mortgage bills, prices still rising in the shops and inflation twice as high as the Bank of England’s target. “Rishi Sunak is too out of touch and his party is too divided to help people who are worried about the cost of living. “A Labour government’s priority would be making working people better off by boosting wages, cutting people’s bills and getting the economy growing again.”                      Food prices and reduction in energy price cap helped reduce inflation rates                    Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), said: “Inflation fell substantially on the month as last year’s steep rise in energy costs has been followed by a small reduction in the energy price cap this year. “Food prices were little changed on the month, after rising this time last year, while hotel prices fell, both helping to push inflation to its lowest rate for two years.”                      UK inflation drops to 4.6 per cent                    The UK’s CPI index has dropped to 4.6% in October, down from 6.7% in September. This means it has fallen to a two-year low, and means inflation has more than halved since late last year.

Downing Street said the prime minister was “proud to appoint a strong, united team” after Ms Braverman, sacked as home secretary in a cabinet reshuffle on Monday , accused him of being “weak” and claimed to have a “document” outlining her conditions for entering government.Full report: Timeline of Rwanda asylum plan as Supreme Court prepares to pass verdictTuesday 14 November 2023 22:08 , Matt Mathers The Supreme Court  judgment on the Government’s plans to removal asylum seekers to Rwanda  comes more than 18 months after they were first announced.Ongoing legal battles have meant there has yet to be any migrants sent to the East African nation under the policy.Meanwhile, the Channel  migrant crisis continues amid much political debate.Here is how events leading up to the ruling from the UK’s highest court on Wednesday have unfolded since the Rwanda plan was unveiled:Brexit ‘chaos’ has hit UK investment, says MandelsonTuesday 14 November 2023 22:00 , Matt Mathers Longstanding low investment is a root cause of the UK’s “dire economic state” and the “deep malaise”, Labour grandee Peter Mandelson has warned.In the global race to secure investment, he told parliament that the UK had “sidelined itself” – with the “chaos” since the Brexit vote inflicting damage to the nation’s international standing.Britain’s reputation for quality of government had also been replaced by one of “political instability”, Lord Mandelson said.Cameron comeback won’t be enough, says John CurticeTuesday 14 November 2023 21:30 , Alex Ross Top polling guru Prof John Curtice says bringing David Cameron back into government won’t be enough to revive Rishi Sunak’s fortunes.“Cameron’s return is unlikely to make much difference to the government’s popularity,” he writes in The Times.Prof Curtice said Mr Cameron “is not especially popular — recent polling from Savanta, for example, suggests that at -21 his net favourability rating is little better than Sunak’s rating of -27”.“However, it will be a brief respite from the reality of the political situation in which the government finds itself. It is on average almost 20 points behind Labour in the polls — no better than the position a year ago following the fall of Liz Truss.”“History suggests that headline-generating reshuffles do not necessarily change the political climate.”Sunak pushing back to ‘centrism’, say right-wing Tory rebelsTuesday 14 November 2023 21:00 , Alex Ross Senior right-wing rebels Danny Kruger and Miriam Cates have had more to say about Rishi Sunak’s reshuffle.The co-leaders of the New Conservatives group of mainly 2019 “red wall” backbenchers said the party was going in the “wrong direction”.“I’m afraid we’re going back into the politics of decline. Where is the energy and the spirit of change that 2019 represented? I worry that we’re going in the wrong direction now,” Mr Kruger told GB News.The influential backbencher said the appointment of David Cameron “sends a very confusing signal to our voters” on Brexit.Ms Cates added: “Instead of leaning back towards that realignment of 2019 voters, the combination of small ‘c’ conservatives, people from the north, people from the south, it feels like going back to kind of 2010 in an era of centrism – which isn’t really what people are crying out for now in the country.”Dorries: Sunak is ‘quick to anger'Tuesday 14 November 2023 20:39 , Matt Mathers Nadine Dorries accused Rishi Sunak of being “quick to anger” as she said it was the wrong move to sack Suella Braverman.“I don’t think it was right to sack Suella,” the former minister, MP and Boris Johnson loyalist told Sky News.“He’s quick to anger and… that mask often slips… it’s just an irritability that you see.”Suella Braverman’s letter is sensational – but this is no ‘Geoffrey Howe’ momentTuesday 14 November 2023 20:10 , Matt Mathers Her furious swipe at Rishi Sunak will go down in history, writes John Rentoul, but will it be a fatal blow?Read John’s full piece here: Suella Braverman’s letter is sensational – but this is no ‘Geoffrey Howe’ moment David Cameron announces UK sanctions against Hamas leaders on first day as foreign secretaryTuesday 14 November 2023 19:37 , Matt MathersRishi Sunak ’s government has announced sanctions against four senior Hamas  leaders and two of the group’s financiers, in David Cameron ’s first move as the new foreign secretary.

So next week we will see an autumn statement for growth.“Because no business can expand without hiring additional staff, I will address labour supply issues to help fill the nearly one million vacancies we have, working with the excellent Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mel Stride).”He added that the statement will build on the 30 hours of free childcare offer announced for all eligible children over nine months in the Spring Budget.Sunak will come under ‘considerable pressure’ to quit ECHR, says Tory MPTuesday 14 November 2023 16:15 , Adam Forrest Conservative MP Martin Vickers – a member of the Common Sense Group of Tory right-wingers – said Mr Sunak would come under “considerable pressure” to quit from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if he loses the Rwanda case.Mr Vickers told The Independent: “There will be considerable pressure from the party to make a clean break. I hope they keep that option open – I have no problem leaving [the ECHRC]. I’m perfectly happy having my rights protected by the British courts.”The backbencher said Ms Braverman’s exit was “inevitable” – but said he “sincerely hopes” that her sacking did not mean a change in the hardline policy on Rwanda. “There can be no rowing back – it must be possible to get the flights going.”Sunak ‘highly unlikely’ to make it to election, claims Tory MPTuesday 14 November 2023 16:00 , Athena Stavrou Rishi Sunak is “highly unlikely” to make it to the general election because he will face a right-wing uprising, a Conservative MP has claimed.The unnamed ally of sacked home secretary Suella Braverman told the Express: “Colleagues are getting more and more angry. I think yesterday many of us were in a state of shock, now there is just fury.”They said: “Really colleagues do not have anything to lose in trying to change leader. They are going to lose their seats anyway if they do nothing so we may as well try to see what would happen with a different leader.”The MP added: “I think it is now highly unlikely that the prime minister will lead us into the next election.”Despite the claim, only Andrea Jenkyns has publicly revealed that she has submitted a letter of no-confidence in Mr Sunak. It would need 53 letters to force a no-confidence, and a majority of Tory MPs would then need to vote against Mr Sunak.David Cameron announces UK sanctions against Hamas leaders on first day as foreign secretaryTuesday 14 November 2023 15:30 , Athena Stavrou The UK has announced sanctions against four Hamas leaders and two of the militant group’s financiers in one of David Cameron’s first moves as Foreign Secretary.Yahya Sinwar, Muhammed Deif, Marwan Issa, Musa Dudin, Abdelbasit Hamza and Nabil Chouman have been made subject to travel bans, asset freezes and arms embargoes that prohibit the sale of weapons to any of the individuals.Sinwar, Deif and Issa are all senior leaders of Hamas while Dudin is a West Bank-based Hamas official and Hamza and Chouman are both financiers, the Foreign Office said.“We will continue to use every tool at our disposal to disrupt the abhorrent activity of this terrorist organisation, working with the United States and our other allies, making it harder for them to operate and isolating them on the world stage,” former prime minister Lord Cameron said.“The Palestinian people are victims of Hamas too. We stand in solidarity with them and will continue to support humanitarian pauses to allow significantly more lifesaving aid to reach Gaza.”The action is co-ordinated with the US and aimed at disrupting operations even if the leaders are “pulling the strings from outside of Gaza”, the department said.Voters back Sunak’s decision to sack BravermanTuesday 14 November 2023 15:14 , Adam Forrest Rishi Sunak’s move to sack Suella Braverman as home secretary appears overwhelmingly popular.

The PM’s official spokesman said the powers available to police to deal with protests would be kept under review to see if they need to be beefed up. “The public rightly expect that the full force of the law is used to bear down on some of the shocking scenes of criminality we saw over the weekend, whether it was EDL protesters or those seemingly supporting Hamas, a proscribed terrorist organisation,” the spokesman said. The spokesman said the PM would be speaking to Sir Mark to “get a shared understanding of how to approach these protests should there be significant protests in the future “It’s important that police have the powers they need to carry out their role and we will continue to keep that under review.”                      SNP hits out at ‘absurdity’ of David Cameron’s appointment                    The SNP has hit out at the “absurdity” of David Cameron being Foreign Secretary while not being an MP and also called on Labour’s MPs in Scotland to back their call for a ceasefire. SNP foreign affairs spokesman Brendan O’Hara told the Commons: “Already we see the absurdity of having a Foreign Secretary who is unable to come to speak in this chamber to elected members at a time of grave international crisis. “There can only be a political solution to this crisis and one has to be found before the entire region is engulfed. That’s why a ceasefire is essential.” On the SNP amendment to the King’s Speech calling for a ceasefire, he said: “I expect members from the Labour Party in Scotland to be in the lobbies with us, because without justice there can be no peace.”                      David Cameron in and Suella Braverman out – ask John Rentoul anything about Rishi Sunak’s cabinet reshuffle                    Braverman’s The Independent’s chief political commentator John Rentoul will be taking your questions at 1pm as David Cameron makes a dramatic return to frontline politics: Rishi Sunak’s dramatic cabinet reshuffle – ask John Rentoul anything                      Ministers discuss inflation at first cabinet meeting                    Cabinet ministers discussed the latest inflation statistics amid hopes the Prime Minister can reach his target of halving inflation. UK wage growth has edged back from record highs but earnings are outstripping inflation at the fastest pace for two years, according to official figures. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said average regular earnings, excluding bonuses, increased by 7.7% in the three months to September, down from an upwardly revised and record high of 7.9% in the previous three months. A Cabinet readout said: “Ahead of new inflation statistics to be released tomorrow, the Chancellor said the continued progress in reducing the rate of inflation was testament to the hard work of Government in retaining fiscal discipline, not fuelling inflation through additional borrowing. “The Prime Minister concluded by saying it was a shared privilege to be a member of Cabinet and that he was confident that the people around the table had the energy and ambition to deliver real change to benefit the public.”                      Braverman tent crackdown shelved                    Downing Street said Suella Braverman’s plans for a crackdown on the use of tents by homeless people had been shelved. Ms Braverman was sacked as home secretary on Monday following a series of controversial comments, including describing homelessness as a “lifestyle choice”. The plans will not be included in the Criminal Justice Bill, No 10 indicated. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “It’s not going to be introduced in the Criminal Justice Bill. I’m not aware of any plans for its introduction elsewhere.”                      Ministers discuss Rwanda plan                    Rishi Sunak and Cabinet ministers looked ahead to Wednesday’s Supreme Court decision on the Rwanda plan. Home Secretary James Cleverly “outlined some of the possible scenarios” of the judgment, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said. A Cabinet readout said: “Ahead of the Supreme Court judgment on the Rwanda migration partnership tomorrow, the Prime Minister highlighted significant progress made by the Government to stop the boats. Rishi Sunak and Cabinet ministers looked ahead to Wednesday’s Supreme Court decision on the Rwanda plan. Home Secretary James Cleverly “outlined some of the possible scenarios” of the judgment, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said. A Cabinet readout said: “Ahead of the Supreme Court judgment on the Rwanda migration partnership tomorrow, the Prime Minister highlighted significant progress made by the Government to stop the boats. “He said that the UK was bucking the global trend by significantly reducing the flow of illegal immigrants into the country while other countries continue to see their numbers rise. “Alongside this, he said we are on track to eliminate the asylum legacy backlog and were making good progress on curbing the use of hotels to house migrants. “The Home Secretary updated Cabinet ahead of the court judgments and on the wider work to curb illegal migration, including through more returns agreements, most recently with Georgia and Albania.”                      Police protest powers to be 'kept under review’                    As Rishi Sunak met Scotland Yard chief Sir Mark Rowley, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the powers available to police to deal with protests would be kept under review to see if they need to be beefed up. “The public rightly expect that the full force of the law is used to bear down on some of the shocking scenes of criminality we saw over the weekend, whether it was EDL protesters or those seemingly supporting Hamas, a proscribed terrorist organisation,” the spokesman said. He added: “The Prime Minister continues to be grateful to police officers, a number of whom were injured over the weekend. “They have an extremely difficult job to do and he was grateful to them for doing it.” The spokesman said the Prime Minister would be speaking to Sir Mark to “get a shared understanding of how to approach these protests should there be significant protests in the future”. “It’s important that police have the powers they need to carry out their role and we will continue to keep that under review.”                      Sunak meeting Met Police commissioner following protest controversy                    Rishi Sunak is meeting Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley in Downing Street, following last Saturday’s unrest around the Cenotaph and the pro-Palestinian demonstration in central London. Downing Street said the pair were meeting to discuss the protests last weekend. It comes after Suella Braverman was sacked as Home Secretary after she branded pro-Palestinian protesters “hate marchers” and accused the police of bias for letting the rally go ahead on Armistice Day.                      Rishi Sunak smiles and jokes in first cabinet meeting since reshuffle                    Rishi Sunak laughed as he opened his first cabinet meeting since his bombshell reshuffle. He welcomed both old and new faces before expanding on his plans for his new “united team:. The prime minister said: “A warm welcome to those for whom it’s their first Cabinet and also a welcome to those for whom it may not be their first time.” Lord Cameron was attending his first Cabinet since quitting as prime minister in 2016. Mr Sunak added: “Our purpose is nothing less than to make the long-term decisions that are going to change our country for the better. “I know that this strong and united team is going to deliver that change for everybody.”                      Iain Duncan Smith questions foreign secretary David Cameron's links to China                    Sir Iain Duncan Smith questioned Lord David Cameron‘s appointment by Rishi Sunak as foreign secretary as “it appears he’s being paid by the Chinese government to promote certain things.” Speaking to GB News on Monday, the Conservative party leader said he had “concerns” about Lord Cameron, before recalling how he was sanctioned by China in 2021 for what it said were “lies and disinformation” about alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Under Lord Cameron’s leadership there was a “golden era” of UK-China cooperation, something Mr Sunak described as “naive” last year following growing tensions with Beijing.                      Cameron ‘symbolises politics of yesterday’, says Kwasi Kwarteng                    Former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has said “time will tell” if Rishi Sunak’s decision to sack Suella Braverman was a mistake.  Mr Kwarteng also said David Cameron symbolises “the politics of yesterday”. “I think the gamble is that somehow David will give gravity and heft and statesmanship. I understand that and I think he’s a capable man,” the man behind Liz Truss’ disastrous mini-Budget told GB News. “But it is odd, having said that you’re the change candidate after 13 years of failed politics to bring someone back who was a prime minister 11 years ago … David Cameron symbolises the politics that was very much of yesterday.” He added: “David has to say very early on that he accepts Brexit because otherwise the suspicion is that somehow he’s going to be close to the EU. He’s got to do a speech or say something to signal that he’s accepted Brexit.”                      Can the return of Lord Cameron of Remainville win back lost Tory voters?                    The PM has seized headlines with his surprise appointment of David Cameron as foreign secretary -but does a lurch to the centre have any hope of securing the Conservatives a fifth term? John Rentoul reports: Can the return of Lord Cameron of Remainville win back lost Tory voters?                      Sunak stresses ‘united team’ at first meeting of new Cabinet                    Rishi Sunak hailed his “strong and united team” at his first Cabinet meeting following the dramatic reshuffle that saw Lord David Cameron appointed Foreign Secretary and Suella Braverman sacked. The reshuffle is designed to prepare the Tories for the next general election, but it has also risked inflaming the rift in the Conservative Party. Former minister Dame Andrea Jenkyns submitted a furious letter of no confidence in Mr Sunak to the Tory backbench 1922 Committee as a result of the decision. Surrounded by a new-look Cabine Mr Sunak promised “big, bold decisions that will drive change”. He said: “Our purpose is nothing less than to make the long-term decisions that are going to change our country for the better. “I know that this strong and united team is going to deliver that change for everybody.”                      David Cameron leaves Downing Street after first meeting of Rishi Sunak’s new cabinet                    Lord David Cameron has left Downing Street after his first Cabinet meeting as foreign minister.                      Downing Street announces changes to Whip                    Downing Street has announced a series of changes in the Whips’ Office. Stuart Anderson, Dame Amanda Milling, Joy Morrissey and Mike Wood were made Government whips while Aaron Bell, Mark Fletcher, Mark Jenkinson and Suzanne Webb became assistant whips.                      Sunak’s five priorities ‘not the limit of ambitions'                    Rishi Sunak stressed that meeting the five priorities he had set was “not the limit of our ambitions”. The Prime Minister told Cabinet: “We want to build a better future for our children and for our grandchildren. “That is what this team is going to do, whether it’s navigating the crises in Ukraine and the Middle East, demonstrating we will stand up for our values and provide security for everyone here at home, but also to make the big, bold decisions that will drive change – a new approach to infrastructure spending, ushering in a generation of children that will grow up smoke-free, reforms to how we approach net zero to save families thousands of pounds and radically reforming our education system.”                      Pictures: First meeting of new Cabinet                    Members of Rishi Sunak’s new Cabinet met for the first time in Downing Street this morning. Former prime minister David Cameron returned to the Cabinet table for the first time since 2016 -this time as foreign secretary.                      Sunak welcomes familiar faces at first meeting of new Cabinet                    Rishi Sunak has welcomed both old and new faces at the first meeting of the new Cabinet at Downing Street this morning. The prime minister said: “A warm welcome to those for whom it’s their first Cabinet and also a welcome to those for whom it may not be their first time.” Lord Cameron was attending his first Cabinet since quitting as prime minister in 2016. Mr Sunak added: “Our purpose is nothing less than to make the long-term decisions that are going to change our country for the better. “I know that this strong and united team is going to deliver that change for everybody.” He noted it was an “important week”, with inflation figures and the Supreme Court’s Rwanda ruling expected on Wednesday and the Chancellor’s autumn statement next Wednesday. “Across all of that I’m confident that we can demonstrate to the country that we are making progress on the priorities that I set out at the beginning of the year – to halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt, cut waiting lists and to stop the boats.”                      Rishi Sunak opens first meeting of new Cabinet                    Rishi Sunak has said his new-look Cabinet would make the “big, bold decisions that will drive change”. Opening the first meeting of his top team since the changes which saw Lord David Cameron return to government, the Prime Minister said: “Looking around this table, I know that we have an energetic and enthusiastic team that is going to deliver for the country. “So, let’s get to work.”                      Tory chair praises new minister for ‘common sense’ Esther McVey                    The new Tory chairman Richard Holden praised “plain-speaking” right-winger Esther McVey after she was appointed “common sense” minister in the Cabinet Office. Appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said that Ms McVey was a “plain-speaking northerner from Merseyside, I think she’s a great addition to the broad team. “What Suella..,” Mr Holden said accidentally.                       Today presenter Nick Robinson asked him if that was a Freudian slip. Continuing, Mr Holden said: “What Esther is going to be doing is bringing that extra dimension to it … What you see is a broad church, Conservative party with a common goal, united together in what it is deciding to put forward to the country. Esther is part of that.”                      David Cameron arrives at Downing Street                    Lord David Cameron has arrived at Downing Street for the first meeting of Rishi Sunak’s new-look Cabinet. The Foreign Secretary walked inside No 10 at 9.10am, accompanied by minister of state for development and Africa Andrew Mitchell. The former prime minister laughed after a Downing Street photographer asked him if he missed being “shouted at in the street”.                      Ministers begin to arrive at Downing Street for first meeting                    James Cleverly has arrived at Downing Street for the first meeting of Rishi Sunak’s new-look Cabinet. The Home Secretary walked inside No 10 at 9am. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Laura Trott was the first minister to walk through the doors of No 10 at around 8.30am.                      Live: Rishi Sunak's Cabinet meet for first time after reshuffle                    Watch live from Downing Street as Rishi Sunak’s cabinet meets for the first time after Monday’s reshuffle:                      Sunak showed ‘bad manners’ in sacking Braverman, says Rees-Mogg                    Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg told Radio 4’s The World Tonight it was a “mistake” to sack Suella Braverman and accused the Prime Minister of ‘bad manners’ given the way she was sacked over the phone rather than face-to-face. “I think the problem for the prime minister was that what Suella Braverman was saying was actually very popular … to lose a senior minister to fire a senior minister … because he [Mr Sunak] is a bit sensitive about the language that is used is not wise.” Rees-Mogg was downbeat on the chances of Rishi Sunak overriding the European Court of Human Rights if the government loses the Rwanda case because the new home secretary James Cleverly has made clear he is opposed to such a radical move. “I think it almost doesn’t matter what the Supreme Court rules now because the power to override the section 39 injunction for want of a better word has to be exercised by the Home Secretary.  The law provides for that. “So the injunction will remain in place regardless of what our own courts rule. Now, I’d be delighted to be proved wrong, but I think it is made the Rwanda solution much, much, less likely to occur.”                      David Cameron in and Suella Braverman out – ask John Rentoul anything about Rishi Sunak’s cabinet reshuffle                                                                The Independent’s chief political commentator John Rentoul will be taking your questions as David Cameron makes a dramatic return to frontline politics:                                         Rishi Sunak’s dramatic cabinet reshuffle – ask John Rentoul anything                      Labour shadow chancellor criticises set-up of the House of Lords                    Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has criticised the set-up of the House of Lords. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the current configuration is “totally unjustifiable” and  “I think that the current set-up of the House of Lords is totally unjustifiable,” she said. “850 and rising members of the House of Lords, a couple of hundred more than we have in the House of Commons. “Non-elected, unaccountable, I don’t think that stacks up in the 21st century.” She added that a Labour government would reform the Lords. “For me, that would start with getting rid of the hereditary peers, which cannot be justified,” she said. “We want a second chamber that represents the nations and the regions of the United Kingdom.” Load-Date: November 16, 2023  End of Document
