   Boris Johnson resigns – live: Tories braced for by-election as former PM quits with ‘narcissistic rant’ The Independent (United Kingdom) June 10, 2023 Saturday 7:18 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: UK POLITICS,UK; Version:1 Length: 6264 words Byline: Jane Dalton and Matt Mathers Highlight: Ex-PM likens Privileges Committee investigation to ‘kangaroo court’ and launches broadside at Rishi Sunak Body   Boris Johnson  claimed he was the “victim of a witch-hunt” as he announced he was resigning as an MP, accusing a Commons investigation into whether he misled parliament over Partygate of attempting to drive him out. The former prime minister compared the Privileges Committee probe to a “kangaroo court” as he quit. Calling for the committee’s investigation to be ended, he said he believed it was “determined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of parliament”. But some saw his wording as a hint he would make a comeback and mount a leadership challenge to Rishi Sunak, at whom he also took a swipe. “It is very sad to be leaving Parliament – at least for now – but above all I am bewildered and appalled that I can be forced out, anti-democratically, by a committee chaired and managed, by Harriet Harman, with such egregious bias,” he said. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP and chair of parliament’s standards committee, described Mr Johnson’s resignation as a “narcissistic rant”. He also said Mr Johnson “effectively leaked” the inquiry’s findings and suggested he could be hit with a second contempt charge.

The former prime minister, in a statement to the media, compared the Privileges Committee probe to a “kangaroo court” as he announced his intention to step down as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. He said, after receiving a letter from the committee, he believed it was “determined to use the proceedings against me to drive me out of Parliament”. “It is very sad to be leaving Parliament – at least for now – but above all I am bewildered and appalled that I can be forced out, anti-democratically, by a committee chaired and managed, by Harriet Harman, with such egregious bias,” he said. The announcement, coming only hours after his resignation honours list had been published, means the Conservatives are likely to face a tough battle to hold onto the London seat at a by-election. It was the second by-election triggered on Friday following former culture secretary Nadine Dorries’ decision to quit the Commons immediately, rather than wait until the next election.

Boris Johnson quits as MP over investigation into whether he misled parliament                      Johnson is a ‘coward’ who ‘jumped’ -Rayner                    Former prime minister Boris Johnson has been accused of being a "coward" by resigning before a Commons Partygate investigation into his comments is published. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner told BBC Radio 5 Live: "To me, he is a coward. "He knows that the Privileges Committee has seen through this fiasco and he has jumped. "He could have defended himself, he could have gone to his constituents and fought the suspension, and he has decided he is not going to do that because he knows he is in the wrong. "And he has never apologised to what he has done to the British people... he has basically been gaslighting the nation, and I think he is a disgrace."                      Boris Johnson’s resignation letter -read it in full                    Boris Johnson  has sensationally resigned as an MP over an investigation into his conduct by the Privileges Committee. The former prime minister claims he has been anti-democratically forced out of parliament, branding the probe a “hitjob”. His full resignation statement is below:  Boris Johnson’s resignation statement in full                      Johnson could be hit with second contempt charge for behaviour in past 24 hours -Bryant                    Boris Johnson could be hit with an additional contempt of parliament charge for his behaviour over the past 24 hours, the chair of the parliament’s standards committee has said. The former prime minister announced his resignation last night and effectively pre-empted the findings of the Partygate inquiry, which he described as a “kangaroo court”. Reports said the inquiry was due to find that he did mislead parliament over Partygate and recommend a lengthy suspension. “They may want to conclude that there has been an additional contempt of parliament by the way that Boris Johnson has behaved in the past 24 hours,” Chris Bryant told BBC Radio 4. “And the attacks on the committee…which are an attack on the whole house. I don’t think anybody can be in any doubt now that Boris Johnson holds parliament in contempt”.                      Partygate inquiry to be published ‘promptly'                    A report into whether Boris Johnson misled MPs over his Partygate assurances will be published “promptly” after the former prime minister’s decision to dramatically quit the Commons. The Commons Privileges Committee said the cross-party panel of MPs will meet on Monday to complete its inquiry. It comes after Mr Johnson launched a blistering attack on the Conservative-majority committee, comparing it to a “kangaroo court” and a “witch hunt”, as he announced his intention to stand down as an MP and trigger an immediate by-election. In a statement, a spokesman said: “The committee has followed the procedures and the mandate of the House at all times and will continue to do so. “Mr Johnson has departed from the processes of the House and has impugned the integrity of the House by his statement. “The committee will meet on Monday to conclude the inquiry and to publish its report promptly.”                      07:11 , Matt Mathers Good morning and welcome to The Independent’s live politics coverage.

Ms Lucas, who had two spells as leader of her party, said her role in Parliament  meant she had “struggled to spend the time I want” on the crises facing the environment.                        Patrick Daly reports:  Caroline Lucas to quit as MP to focus on climate campaigning                      Biden and Sunak to focus on Ukraine and economic security in PM’s first White House visit                    President Joe Biden is welcoming prime minister Rishi Sunak for wide-ranging talks on Thursday as the British leader makes his first White House since taking office. The leaders’ Oval Office talks are expected to cover the war in Ukraine, China, economic security, international cooperation on regulating the growing field of artificial intelligence, and more. Biden and Sunak have already had four face-to-face meetings since Sunak became prime minister in October, but the talks in Washington will offer the two leaders a chance for their most sustained interaction to date. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the 15-month-old Russian invasion of Ukraine will be “top of mind.” The US and UK are the two biggest donors to the Ukraine war effort and play a central role in a long-term effort announced last month to train, and eventually equip, Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets.

The former prime minister’s list has already raised eyebrows after he reportedly nominated a series of close political allies, friends and associates – including several Tory MPs and his own father.  But Mr Sunak is poised to approve the list of some 50 names in the coming weeks in a bid to “clear the decks” of another row involving predecessor, according to The Times. Full report below: Rishi Sunak ‘to approve Boris Johnson’s honours list’ despite by-election warnings                      Boris and Carrie Johnson ‘hosted friend at Chequers to plan festival-themed wedding during Covid restrictions’                    Boris  and Carrie Johnson  hosted a close friend at Chequers  while some coronavirus  restrictions were still in place, it has been reported. The former prime minister and his then-pregnant wife are said to have invited corporate events organiser Dixie Maloney to the Buckinghamshire country mansion on 7 May 2021. At the time, indoor gatherings between different households were banned except when “reasonably necessary” for reasons such as work or childcare or to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person, including someone pregnant.

Today we’ll be covering Rishi Sunak’s visit to Washington DC, Boris Johnson’s alleged Covid breach and other stories from Westminster and elsewhere. Stay tuned for the latest updates.                      Johnson coud attempt ‘chicken run’ to a safer seat                    The wording of Boris Johnson’s resignation letter suggests he could attempt a “chicken run” to a safer seat, a political commentator has suggested. Mr Johnson announced he was quitting last night, sparking a by-election in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. He holds a majority of 7,210 in the constituency but some analysts say he was at risk of losing at the next general election, partly due to the Partygate scandal. Nadine Dorries, one of Mr Johnson’s closest allies, also announced her resignation as the MP for Mid Bedfordshire and previous reports have suggested the former PM could run for the constituency. “I think the fact that in the statement he says he’s very sad to be leaving parliament but then adds, at least for now, clearly opens the possibility of a return, logically to a safer seat,” Katy Balls, political editor of The Spectator Magazine, told BBC Radio 4. “I think the question is, is it such a fast manoeuver, as to go for Nadine Dorries’s seat…were he to even attempt that, is that the type of thing Rishi Sunak and CCHQ would allow.” Load-Date: July 20, 2023  End of Document
