   I'm A Celeb viewers accuse ITV show of 'woke' bias after Ant and Dec joke about Nigel Farage driving 'too far to the right' and contestants make 'cheap' Brexit jokes MailOnline November 20, 2023 Monday 7:21 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 928 words Byline: Martin Robinson, Chief Reporter Body   Nigel Farage's army of fans are irate today after he was immediately the butt of a series of Brexit-related jokes on the first night of I'm A Celebrity.                      ITV viewers have also laid into Ant and Dec after they gleefully made a 'far right' joke within minutes of Sunday's show starting. Some said the barrage of Brexit jokes only makes them want Mr Farage, who is being paid £1.5million to appear on the show, to win more, amid a boycott by left-wing viewers.  One critic said: 'So after 10 minutes.. 2 Brexit insults, Ant & Dec saying GB News only has 2 viewers, Nigel's driving was veering 'too far to the right'. NO insults for other contestants? He was invited by a far left show to ridicule him... sad *****!' Some believe he is on the show as a 'trap' in the hope he will say something controversial and be cancelled.  The gags at his expense - also viewed as digs of Britons who voted Brexit - began as soon as Mr Farage, 59, was dropped off in the outback where he met This Morning's Josie Gibson, 38, who made a quip about Brexit just moments later.  'It's something different in life, it's an adventure. It's a challenge, it's not going to be easy, but why not?' said Farage, as Ms Gibson explained that she was 'petrified.' She responded: 'It can't be worse than Brexit.'  Farage said: 'Oh, didn't take long did it? Didn't take long. I had a feeling we'd get a bit of that,' to which Ms Gibson insisted that she was 'only joking.' Minutes later Mr Farage had to drive 4x4 with Josie and TikTok star Nella Rose. Ant and Dec didn't miss a beat - saying: 'Is it me, or did he veer just a bit too far to the right?', Dec said.  And shortly after that Ant & Dec took a swipe at rival channel GB News, which Nigel Farage is taking a break from to appear in the jungle.  Following some viewers declaring they would boycott the show due to the former Brexit leaders appearance Dec, 48, said: 'The man who had got everyone talking, Nigel Farage,'. 'Now, Nigel is not just known for his controversial political career, he's also got his own show on GB news.'  Adding: 'Of course he won't be presenting that show over the next three weeks, so we'd like to take this opportunity to apologise to all of GB News viewers.'  With Ant quipping: 'Sorry Keith, Sorry Linda' - to roars of laughter from their crew. In his introduction on the show, Mr Farage acknowledged he was an 'absolute villain' to millions, but said he hoped viewers would have the chance to 'find the real me'. He quipped: 'I dealt with snakes in the European Parliament, I can cope with this too.' Last night Farage, Gibson and Rose were given their first challenge to earn time for the other batch of celebrities to win their challenges, which would in turn earn them all meals for the camp. Wearing a smart pink linen shirt and beige trousers, the former politician and Ms Rose had to poke their heads through 'hell holes' filled with snakes to retrieve tokens, using their tongues to move them along a metal wire. 'We just do it and we can move on to the next challenge,' said a steely Farage. While Ms Rose failed to get any of the tokens, Farage got all three of his, as did Ms Gibson who had to submerge her head in a barrel. But Farage, who is exempt from some trials due to injuries he sustained during a near-fatal 2010 plane crash, had more to overcome before he could even enter the camp. He and Ms Rose had to then sit in the back of a burnt out truck, filled with gunge and creepy crawlies, while searching for tokens tied onto a rope. Ms Rose managed to get all three of her tokens while Farage and Ms Gibson got two each, earning seven minutes for their fellow celebrities to complete their trials. And once finally in the camp, Farage was seen chatting to food critic Grace Dent - who it emerged had previously joked about his plane crash. At the time the restaurant critic, 50, shared to Twitter: 'I hope none of the people who saved Nigel Farage's life today were pesky immigrants.' The politician, who has been highly critical of immigration levels to Britain, was so badly injured he underwent a neck reconstruction and had his leg in plaster for a year.

And more fireworks are expected with Tony Bellew, 40, set to enter the camp and ruffle a few feathers. The former cruiserweight title winning boxer could be involved in a Brexit bust-up with Nigel Farage, 59, over his political views. In 2022, Tony branded Nigel an 'absolute maniac' for his opinion on immigration. Tony hit out at the politician for his video message that he posted online discussing figures from the Office of National Statistics that suggested London, Birmingham and Manchester were all classed as minority white cities. At the time, Nigel explained: 'There is a massive change in the identity of our country through immigration. In response to Nigel's message, Tony hit back and wrote: 'Why does someone's colour matter? Who cares if your white, black, yellow or pink? All that matters is are they good or no good people. 'Learn to see people for who they are and not what they look like! It's cos of people like you that racism still exists! Absolute maniac you are'. Load-Date: November 20, 2023  End of Document
