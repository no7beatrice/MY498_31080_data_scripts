   John Swinney refuses to say if SNP backs new North Sea oil exploration telegraph.co.uk June 3, 2024 Monday 10:45 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:2 Length: 14006 words Byline: By Genevieve Holl-Allen, Political Reporter and Ewan Somerville and Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor Body   Follow our latest general election coverage.  John Swinney has refused to say whether the SNP would back new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea. The First Minister said climate compatibility tests should be conducted before any new oil and gas licences were issued, but he declined four times to say whether he personally wanted to see further exploration. Under Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP backed a presumption against new drilling. Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s Westminster leader has hinted that he was lobbying Mr Swinney to abandon the policy.  Mr Swinney said: “I want to make sure that every decision we take has got a climate compatibility test attached to it. That’s the crucial issue we’ve got to take.” Asked again, the First Minister gave the same answer but Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, responded: “That’s a no. John Swinney and the SNP are against new oil and gas licences. Just say it. Be honest, John.” Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, also came under pressure during the STV debate over his party’s plan to end new exploration if Sir Keir Starmer becomes Prime Minister, and for a windfall tax on the industry. Rishi Sunak has previously granted new oil and gas licences in Scotland, saying last year it was “the right thing to do”. Mr Sarwar told voters that a vote for Scottish Labour is a vote to “maximise Scotland’s influence” in the UK and claimed his party was “the change Scotland needs”. Meanwhile, the First Minister came under fire from all sides over the SNP’s record, with the Scottish Conservatives’ leader Douglas Ross claiming Mr Swinney was “at the centre of every scandal the SNP has been involved in for the last 17 years.” Mr Swinney faced questions over the expenses scandal surrounding SNP MSP Michael Matheson, as well as the deletion of WhatsApp messages during the Covid pandemic. Mr Sarwar accused the SNP government of being “mired in sleaze and scandal” and also took aim at Mr Ross, who he said should be “begging for forgiveness from the Scottish people” after 14 years of a Conservative Government in Westminster.  The TV debate featured the Scottish leaders of the four parties that won Westminster seats in the last election. The 90-minute showdown, broadcast from STV’s Glasgow studios, was the first TV debate of the election campaign.It was staged shortly after a detailed poll by YouGov became the latest survey to predict a Labour surge in Scotland, with the SNP being routed on July 4 and wiped out in Glasgow. The survey of 5,541 Scots-more than five times the normal sample-predicted Labour would win 34 out of the 57 seats being contested following boundary changes. This is up from only one in the 2019 election.In contrast, the SNP tally would tumble from 48 to only 17. After winning all Glasgow’s seats in the 2015 and 2019 elections, the Nationalists would be ejected from Scotland’s largest city.Labour would take all six Glasgow constituencies on its way to its best general election performance in Scotland since 2010, when Gordon Brown was Prime Minister and it won 41 seats.The Tories were predicted to drop from six to five seats and the Liberal Democrats from four to just one. YouGov predicted that 61 per cent of Scottish seats will change hands compared to 41 per cent in England.However, 20 seats – more than a third of the total – are deemed to be “toss ups” as a small swing in votes would change the victor. The SNP is one of the two parties in all 20 of these marginal contests, with Labour involved in 17.Asked about the poll, Mr Swinney admitted that the SNP had faced “tough times” and he intended to use the campaign to try and regain the electorate’s trust.

Thanks for following along. We’re back tomorrow but until then here are some key developments from Monday on the campaign trail:                                             Nigel Farage announced that he would be standing as an MP for Reform UK in Clacton and that he was now leader of the party, taking over from Richard Tice.                       Mr Farage claimed that “within a week” Reform could be level with the Conservatives in the polls.                       The first YouGov MRP poll of the campaign predicted that Labour would win the most seats in its history, returning 422 MPs to Westminster.                       Scottish party leaders took part in the first television debate of the general election campaign, in which First Minister John Swinney refused to say whether the SNP would back new oil and gas licences in the North Sea.                       The Tories set out their pledge to change the law to protect women’s spaces, with Kemi Badenoch claiming that the change would stop people “misinterpreting” current rules around gender and sex.                       Angela Rayner said she wanted to rid the world of nuclear weapons, while Sir Keir Starmer said he would be willing to use them, as Labour revealed its “triple lock” on Trident pledge.                                          03 Jun 2024-09:37PM GMT                                          John Swinney says ‘Labour are going to walk it in England’                     John Swinney predicted Labour was “going to walk it in England” in the General Election.The First Minister said: “The Tories are finished.”However he insisted Scotland’s interests needed to be “protected” at Westminster, telling the Scottish Labour leader: “You might change the government but you are going to keep austerity.”The SNP leader said Sir Keir Starmer and Labour would maintain the same “fiscal stranglehold” on the public purse, claiming that would be “disastrous for public services”.03 Jun 2024-09:28PM GMTRoss: Swinney has been ‘at the centre of every scandal the SNP has been involved in for 17 years’Douglas Ross has accused John Swinney of being “at the centre of every scandal the SNP has been involved in for the last 17 years. In a punchy attack, Mr Ross claimed Mr Swinney is tainted by scandal, raising the ferries fiasco, his defence of disgraced expenses cheat Michael Matheson and what is seen as a poor record as Nicola Sturgeon’s education secretary.He added: “How can you move Scotland forward when you’ve been at the centre of every scandal the SNP has been involved in for the last 17 years?”Mr Cole-Hamilton then brought up Mr Swinney’s deletion of WhatsApp messages during the Covid pandemic.Mr Swinney said he “followed the Scottish Government’s retention policy” and has set out his position to the Covid inquiry over the Covid messages.While he does not directly admit it, Mr Swinney like Ms Sturgeon did delete his messages. Mr Cole-Hamilton said this was the “biggest scandal of devolution”.The Lib Dem said young people mentally scarred by lockdown now face huge waiting times for help.Mr Swinney said the Scottish Government has made record investment in the NHS.03 Jun 2024-09:27PM GMT‘Only Scottish Labour can boot the Tories out of power’ says deputy leaderOnly Scottish Labour “can boot the Tories out of power” and “the people of Scotland have the power to make that happen”, the party’s deputy leader has said. Speaking after the debate, Dame Jackie Baillie said that while John Swinney “would rather attack Labour than the Tories”, Labour was the party that is “ready to deliver the change Scotland needs”.She said: “This debate clearly showed that only Scottish Labour can boot the Tories out of power and that the people of Scotland have the power to make that happen.“Scottish homeowners face paying over £2,000 more per year on their mortgage after the Tories crashed the economy while the SNP’s economic mismanagement means that Scotland is lagging behind the rest of the UK. 03 Jun 2024-09:23PM GMTThe debate is over-analysis from The Telegraph’s Scottish CorrespondentAfter a one-minute speech each, in which the leaders seek to hammer home their key messages, the debate is over,Daniel Sanderson writes.Over the previous hour, Mr Swinney came under pressure over his record in government and lack of clarity over whether the SNP backs new oil and gas drilling.Developing a theme from the SNP’s campaign relaunch on Sunday, he also repeatedly claimed that Labour would win the election but impose “austerity” on Scotland.Mr Ross’s openness in refusing to defend the government’s of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, and his admission that he had made mistakes, was also notable.However, none of the parties are likely to have felt that they landed a killer blow that will decisively change the narrative of the election.The host, STV’s Colin Mackay, says the debate was “actually pretty civilised” compared to previous outings.03 Jun 2024-09:22PM GMTSarwar accuses SNP Government of being ‘mired in sleaze and scandal’Anas Sarwar is also highlighting Mr Swinney’s record in government, which he says is “mired in sleaze and scandal,”Daniel Sanderson writes.He raised Mr Swinney’s downgrading of exam results for children from poor backgrounds during the pandemic, cuts to council budgets and the fact that one in six Scots are on NHS waiting lists.Mr Swinney said he agrees with Mr Sarwar that voters need to get rid of the Tory government. He insists the best way to do this is to vote SNP.Mr Sarwar countered by saying that while the SNP could get rid of six Tory MPs, Labour can “get rid of an entire Tory government”.Returning to his theme of attacking Labour from the Left, Mr Swinney said Labour may be about to get rid of the Tory government but is “going to keep austerity”. Mr Sarwar said this is not true.03 Jun 2024-09:03PM GMTAnas Sarwar tells Douglas Ross he should be ‘begging for forgiveness from the Scottish people’Douglas Ross should be “begging for forgiveness” from the people of Scotland for the “Tory Party damage” of the past 14 years, Anas Sarwar said.“You shouldn’t be pleading for votes, you should be begging for forgiveness from the Scottish people,” he said.Mr Sarwar pointed to an increase in mortgage rates, food and energy prices.The Scottish Tory leader said he would he was not “downplaying the difficult circumstances that are facing people in Scotland, across the UK and indeed in many other parts of the world”.03 Jun 2024-09:01PM GMTDouglas Ross grilled over support of Boris Johnson and Liz TrussDouglas Ross has been grilled by the Scottish Liberal Democrats over his historic support of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss,Daniel Sanderson writes.Alex Cole-Hamilton claimed Mr Ross “excused the inexcusable” and defended some of the “worst Prime Ministers in British history.”The Scottish Tory leader said he did not support Mr Johnson over partygate, and “did not try to defend it”. He said he put in a letter of no confidence in Mr Johnson.He conceded it is “legitimate” to question his judgement over the fiasco, after Mr Cole-Hamilton pointed out that Mr Ross withdrew his letter of no confidence in Mr Johnson to the 1922 Committee.However, he said he only did so because of the Russian invasion of the Ukraine.In a reference to his second job as a referee, Mr Ross said “we can go to VAR to check” after Mr Cole-Hamilton said only Mr Swinney and Mr Ross talk about independence.He pointed out that the Lib Dem brought it up earlier in the debate.Continuing the theme, Anas Sarwar claimed Mr Ross should be “begging for forgiveness from the Scottish people” for high mortgages and the cost of living crisis.He was conciliatory in response, and said he will not defend the various Tory scandals in Westminster.Asked if he was defending Liz Truss or Suella Braverman, who Mr Sarwar accuses of inciting riots at the Cenotaph, he replies “no”.He also told John Swinney he “holds his hands up” and made a mistake by supporting Liz Truss’s mini-budget, saying he wrongly assumed work had been done to ensure it would be a success.03 Jun 2024-08:47PM GMTTory Party chairman campaigns in Clacton hours after Nigel Farage announces he’ll stand thereThe Conservative Party chairman travelled down to Clacton to campaign just hours after Nigel Farage announced he was going to stand there as an MP for Reform UK.Richard Holden wrote a supportive post on X praising the Conservative candidate Giles Watling, who is seeking re-election as the area’s MP.“He’s always here, helping local people. This isn’t about vanity or ego for Giles, it’s about the people here. And it’s about our country too.”He added: “He doesn’t want to see Britain handed over Sir Keir Starmer & Angela Rayner with their blank cheque for the EU on £ and migration, tax rises for pensioners, and no plan to reduce tax for working people.”Lovely to pop down to #FrintonOnSea  to meet @GilesWatling  and a good gang from the Clacton @Conservatives -who turned up at just a couple of hours noticeGiles has been a terrific local representative.

That’s the crucial issue we’ve got to take.”When asked again, he said: “I’ve given you your answer, which is we’ve got to have a climate compatibility test on every single decision we take in relation to the oil and gas sector.”Douglas Ross said: “That’s a no. John Swinney and the SNP are against new oil and gas licenses. Just say it, be honest John.”03 Jun 2024-08:20PM GMTSwinney and Sarwar clash on windfall taxes on oil and gas companiesJohn Swinney has compared Anas Sarwar to Margaret Thatcher as the pair clashed on oil and gas licences.Labour has proposed windfall taxes on oil and gas companies if they enter government.Speaking to Mr Sarwar, the First Minister said: “I’m in favour of windfall taxes when gross profits have been made. The danger of your position on this is that that is going to lead to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the northeast of Scotland. “Now that I’m afraid is a price that is not worth paying, that’s what Mrs Thatcher did.”03 Jun 2024-08:14PM GMTAlex Cole-Hamilton: ‘Scottish Liberal Democrats are all about hope’Alex Cole-Hamilton, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, has said that the party is “part of the change that’s coming”.In his opening remarks to the debate, he said: “Over many years government ministers in London and Edinburgh have lost sight of what matters to you. You’re working harder but it feels like you’re falling further behind.“We badly need some hope and a change of direction. Well, Scottish Liberal Democrats are all about hope, and we’re part of the change that’s coming.He added: “In the next Parliament we’ll be working for a better Britain, to restore your faith in politics and fix our broken relationship with Europe.“We’ll fight for fast access to GPs, NHS dentists and mental health services.“We’ll stop sewage being dumped in our rivers and fight the climate emergency.03 Jun 2024-08:12PM GMTJohn Swinney hits out at Brexit and says SNP is ‘doing everything it can’Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney has said that the SNP is “doing everything we can to protect Scotland in these tough times”.In his opening remarks, he told the debate: “I know that many of you are struggling with the cost of living. I know you want the very best of healthcare for you and your family. If you are in business, Brexit has made your life a lot tougher.“I want to sort those issues out.

If the SNP win they will claim every seat as a mandate for independence.“They’ll be distracted from the local issues you care about.“So in key seats up and down Scotland, if everyone who wants to beat the SNP votes together for the Scottish Conservatives, we can end that obsession with independence for good.”03 Jun 2024-08:02PM GMTSTV debate comes after ‘super-poll’ predicts SNP wipeout in GlasgowThe STV debate comes shortly after a “super-poll” became the latest survey to predict a Labour surge in Scotland, with the SNP being routed on July 4 and wiped out in Glasgow, Simon Johnson writes.The YouGov survey of 5,541 Scots-more than five times the normal sample-predicted Labour would win 34 out of the 57 seats being contested following boundary changes.

With support for Reform having held up in the early campaigns – and with no sign of any discernible increase in Conservative support – this time he has brought the Tories news that they will not want to hear.Read the analysis by Britain’s leading polling guru here 03 Jun 2024-07:02PM GMTWhy Farage’s return could be the lift Reform needs to top Tories in pollsNigel Farage’s decision to stand as an MP could help Reform UK overtake the Tories in polls.Polling in February looking at the potential effect of his return suggested that among the general public, the party would go from 19 per cent favourability to 25 per cent. At the time, the Tories were polling at 20 per cent.In Clacton, polling suggests that Mr Farage would win the seat. Anthony Mack, Reform’s previous candidate, was forecast to come third after the Tories, who would win, on 38 per cent and Labour on 30 per cent.However, polling by Survation in January suggested that if Mr Farage ran as the Reform candidate in the constituency, he would win 37 per cent of the vote, coming first and pushing down the Tories to 27 per cent and Labour to 23 per cent.on this here 03 Jun 2024-06:58PM GMTIn pictures: Campaign trail latest03 Jun 2024-06:53PM GMTClacton: Residents react to Farage’s announcementResidents of Clacton have given a mixed reaction to Nigel Farage’s decision to stand as the Reform UK candidate for the constituency at the general election.As the announcement was made, the high street of the seaside town in Essex was quiet despite the mild weather and people did not seem keen to speak about the upcoming election or about Mr Farage’s announcement.Edel Ruddy, 58, who has lived in Clacton for 40 years, told the PA news agency she would “definitely” be voting for Mr Farage, saying she felt it was “unfair” that businesses in Clacton were closing down and that the town has been “forgotten”.“No-one wants to fight for Clacton,” she added. But George Charalambous, 59, who moved to Clacton from east London around five months ago, said he thought voting for the Reform UK candidate was a “wasted vote” as Mr Farage “wouldn’t achieve much”The former factory worker said he would be voting for Labour but would also consider voting tactically either for Reform UK or the Liberal Democrats in order to defeat the Conservative candidate.03 Jun 2024-06:39PM GMTWatch: Farage tells voters ‘Let’s make Britain great again’Nigel Farage has released his first video since announcing that he is the new leader of Reform and will stand to be an MP in Clacton.He told voters: “I believe in Britain.

It’s the first TV debate of the wider UK general election campaign ahead of two highly-anticipated duels between leaders in England on Tuesday and Friday.Ahead of it starting, Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney has called for a “respectful” contest with Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton.The third biggest party at Holyrood the Scottish Greens will not be represented, a decision they described as “outrageous”. STV has said it is comfortable that its election coverage complies with Ofcom rules around due impartiality.Stay right here for updates from the debate and build up to it.03 Jun 2024-05:59PM GMTOther key lines from YouGov’s MRP pollHere’s some other predictions in this large-scale poll that you may have missed. The Conservatives would end up with their worst performance since 1906.The Lib Dems are on course to become the third-largest party in Parliament once again with 48 seats, four times what they won in 2019.A second seat, Bristol Central, would be won by the Greens for the first time, alongside Brighton Pavilion.Reform UK would get nothing, but is forecast to come second in 27 constituencies, though this poll pre-dates Nigel Farage’s return as leader and MP candidate.Cautiously applying their estimate from late last year that roughly three in 10 Reform voters would side with the Tories if Reform was not standing, YouGov predicts the party to be costing the Tories the win in 16 seats-all on a knife-edge between with Labour-such as Chatham and Aylesford, Bridgwater, and West Suffolk.Some 131 seats are currently a tossup where the winning party’s lead is fewer than five points.Labour set to become the largest party in Scotland by some margin, taking 34 seats to the SNP’s 17, the Conservatives five and the Lib Dems one, the best Labour seat haul there since the 2005 and 2010 general elections, at both of which it won 41 seats.03 Jun 2024-05:02PM GMTYour views on today’s Reform news03 Jun 2024-05:00PM GMTTories say Farage is handing Starmer ‘blank cheque’The Tories have claimed Nigel Farage is “doing exactly what Keir Starmer wants him to do” by entering the general election fray.A Conservative Party spokesman said: “Nigel Farage risks handing Keir Starmer a blank cheque to rejoin the EU, impose the retirement tax on pensioners and hike taxes on hardworking Brits up and down the UK.“Farage knows that Reform won’t win any seats, but he doesn’t seem to care that a vote for Reform only helps Labour. He’s doing exactly what Keir Starmer wants him to do.”The party added: “Is Farage really willing to risk undoing his life’s work by handing Starmer a blank cheque to rejoin the EU?“Only a vote for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives can deliver a clear plan, bold action and a secure future for our country.”03 Jun 2024-04:32PM GMTWhat party is on course to win in your constituency?This is according to YouGov’s new MRP poll as we’ve reported below.03 Jun 2024-04:26PM GMTWatch: Grant Shapps told he’s set to lose seat on TVGrant Shapps has just been told live on air that he is forecast to lose his seat.

They are on the verge of total collapse.”Asked whether he has boosted Sir Keir Starmer’s chances by running for parliament, the new Reform leader said: “No, is the answer.”He added that in a week’s time, “I think you’ll see we’re going to start drawing from Labour equally as much as the Conservatives.“The Conservative Party have lost this election without my intervention.”03 Jun 2024-03:44PM GMTWhy’s Farage standing in Clacton?Here’s a bit more about Clacton, the seaside town in Essex where the new Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has decided to stand as an MP.

Mr Watling stood in 2015, but came second to Douglas Carswell who won it as UKIP’s only seat in the general election with a majority of 3,437, having defected from the Tories in 2014. The other candidates standing in Clacton are: Jovan Owusu-Nepaul for the Labour Party, Matthew Bensilum for the Liberal Democrats, and Natasha Osben for the Green Party. Mr Farage will launch his campaign in Clacton on midday on Tuesday at the end of the pier. Asked about the place, he quipped: “There’s a very good Wetherspoons there.”                      03 Jun 2024-03:23PM GMT                                         I’m back, says Farage                    Nigel Farage has vowed that “I’m coming back for the next five years” as leader of Reform UK, not just for this election. “We all know already that the Conservative Party will be in opposition, but not the opposition, they are incapable of it,” he tells a press conference in south-east London.  He says that the Conservative Party is “split down the middle on policy” and “frankly, right now, don’t stand for a damn thing”, in contrast to his party who are “unashamedly patriotic”. Mr Farage insists that Reform UK are going after “millions and millions of votes, and I’m talking far more than UKIP got in 2014” and “a political revolt”. Reform UK insists again that this is “the immigration election”.                       03 Jun 2024-03:18PM GMT                                         Farage standing to be an MP in Clacton, Essex                    Reform UK’s new leader Nigel Farage has just announced that he is standing. “Difficult though it is, I can’t let down those millions of people, I simply can’t do it,” he tells a hastily called press conference in London just now. “So I have decided, I’ve changed my mind. It’s allowed you know. It’s not always a sign of weakness it can potentially be a sign of strength.  “So I am going to stand for this election... in the Essex seaside town of Clacton.”                      03 Jun 2024-03:14PM GMT                                         Breaking: Nigel Farage to stand as an MP                    The Telegraph has been told that Nigel Farage is standing as an MP.

He replaces Mr Tice and moves from his previous role of honorary president. Mr Farage tells an “emergency” press conference in London just now that the campaign needs “gingering up” as it is currently “the dullest, most boring election campaign we have ever seen in our lives”.

Nigel Farage will make an “emergency general election” announcement this afternoon, amid speculation that he will stand for Parliament. Richard Tice, the leader of Reform UK, refused to rule out the possibility that the party’s honorary president would be announcing his candidacy earlier today.

We’ve just had two announcements in close succession about the BBC seven-way TV debate this Friday.  First, the Conservative Party confirmed that the House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt will represent them, in news likely to excite the Tory grassroots who have discussed her as a potential future party leader.  Then, Labour announced that deputy leader Angela Rayner will appear on their behalf.  It sets up a face off between the two, likely to be blockbuster viewing for us political wonks.  The other parties haven’t yet confirmed who they are sending, with one question looming over whether Richard Tice or Nigel Farage will appear for Reform UK. Mishal Husain will host the debate in London between 7.30pm to 9pm, with senior figures from the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Greens also invited.                      03 Jun 2024-02:43PM GMT                                         Sunak a Taylor Swift and country music fan?                    The Prime Minister told a Wantage girls football team, for those aged 12 to 15, that he was currently “slowly getting into” country music. Rishi Sunak revealed he was listening to The Cowboy In Me by Tim McGraw, which he heard in the television series Yellowstone, when asked about his favourite music. “I definitely cannot sing it,” he added when faced with encouragement from the team, telling them he was saving his voice for ITV’s upcoming election debate. Mr Sunak also spoke about how he listens to Taylor Swift, but When The Saints Go Marching In, the anthem for his favourite team Southampton, was his best song.                      03 Jun 2024-02:41PM GMT                                         Sunak’s favourite Nando’s order revealed                    On the second campaign stop of Monday, Rishi Sunak revealed his favour Nando’s order, in news that of course everyone needs to know. The Prime Minister was asked about his preferred order from the peri-peri style chicken restaurant by a girls football team in Wantage, Oxfordshire. Mr Sunak revealed his Nando’s order was a half chicken, medium spiced, with chips and broccoli, adding: “It’s good broccoli.” The Prime Minister said he also likes to “mix it up” sometimes and get boneless thighs. Who else is having flashbacks of Mr Sunak, then Chancellor, transforming himself into a Wagamama waiter for Eat Out to Help Out now?                      03 Jun 2024-02:26PM GMT                                         New poll: Labour lead increases to 26 points                    Labour’s lead over the Tories has widened to 26 points, a new poll suggests. Sir Keir Starmer’s party stays on 46 per cent to the Conservatives’ 20 per cent-down three points-in the new Redfield & Wilton poll released on Monday afternoon. It puts Reform on 14 points and the Lib Dems on 10, both an increase of one, while the Greens are on five per cent and the SNP two per cent.

The SNP leader responded to a Tory election promise to define the protected characteristic of sex as “biological sex”, designed to protect women-only spaces. Kemi Badenoch, the UK’s women and equalities minister, said her party would move to make gender recognition a matter reserved to Westminster. On Monday, Mr Swinney said on a visit to Stirling: “This is just another step in the Conservative attempts to erode the powers of the Scottish Parliament. It’s been going on for some time.” Brexit and the Internal Market Act had also weakened Holyrood’s powers, Mr Swinney claimed. on the biological sex policy here                      03 Jun 2024-01:55PM GMT                                         In pictures: Campaign trail latest                                         03 Jun 2024-01:45PM GMT                                         Why’s Rishi Sunak in Wokingham?                    What’s the data behind the Prime Minister’s latest choice of location? Rishi Sunak held an event in Bury North only last week, perhaps conscious of how pivotal this kind of ultra-marginal seat will be to the election outcome. But he spent his Monday morning in a very different part of the country: by the River Thames on the border between Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, visiting a rowing club in the constituency of Wokingham. Here the Conservatives are facing a challenge from the Liberal Democrats. Wokingham is ranked at number 35 on the Lib Dems’ target list, based on the size of swing-11.6 percentage points-the party needs to take it from the Tories. It is a far larger swing than the one needed by Labour in Bury North, but the Lib Dems have managed even greater swings than this in recent by-elections. Wokingham was represented in the House of Commons from 1987 to 2024 by Sir John Redwood, who twice stood unsuccessfully for Tory leader.                      03 Jun 2024-01:40PM GMT                                         The key data behind seats leaders are visiting today                    Party leaders might look like they’re just rocking up in different areas of the country each day, but there are electoral strategists and data behind each and every visit.  Sir Keir Starmer kicked off a new week on the campaign trail by visiting one of his party’s key targets at the election, Bury North in Greater Manchester. The seat ranks at number seven on Labour’s target list and is one of five constituencies in north-west England that are in the party’s top 10. The others are Burnley (number one on the list), Leigh & Atherton (number two), Bury South (number six) and Bolton North East (number eight). All five of these seats are being defended by the Conservatives and all would fall to Labour on a swing from the Tories of just 1.3 percentage points, with Bury North needing a swing of 1.2 points. It is the first time during the campaign that the Labour leader has visited one of his party’s top 10 targets.                      03 Jun 2024-01:33PM GMT                                         Handing over the baton                    Good afternoon, this is Ewan Somerville now taking over from Jack Maidment for the rest of the day.

The Tories have promised to increased spending to 2.5 per cent by 2030 and Labour has committed to the same target but not set a deadline for delivering it.  Mr Wallace told the BBC Radio 4 World at One programme: “The threat is rising towards the end of the decade, I would suggest, as others have, that towards the end of the decade we should be spending 3 per cent of GDP. “However, to get there you have to follow a progressive line, you can’t just dollop billions of dollars or pounds to a department who won’t be able to spend it.”                      03 Jun 2024-01:14PM GMT                                         Analysis: How Starmer is trying to persuade voters Labour can be trusted on defence                                         03 Jun 2024-01:08PM GMT                                         Have your general election questions answered                    As the country prepares for its first general election since 2019, The Telegraph’spolitical correspondent , Dominic Penna, will be answering your questions on the contest on Thursday June 6 at 5pm.

In a 19-second clip posted on the social media platform on Sunday evening, the Prime Minister , standing in front of a flip chart, offers to give “an explainer on Labour’s policy for our country’s future”. He then unveils a blank sheet of white paper, shrugs his shoulders and walks off. But Labour was quick to edit the video to superimpose its six election pledges  on the flip chart under the heading “Keir Starmer’s first steps for change”.                      03 Jun 2024-12:25PM GMT                                         Watch: Lib Dem boat stunt interrupts Sunak event in Henley-on-Thames                    We now have some (fairly undramatic) footage of the Lib Dems’ boat stunt behind Rishi Sunak in Henley-on-Thames (see the post below at 13.04).  Shehab Khan, a political correspondent at ITV News, tweeted the following:  Don't think Rishi Sunak was aware that a boat filled with Lib Dems popped up behind him on the campaign trail today...And I'm pretty sure that's the Lib Dem Deputy Leader, Daisy Cooper on it too... pic.twitter.com/BJhEox9XlQ                      03 Jun 2024-12:14PM GMT                                         Sunak won’t be drawn on Farage speculation                    Rishi Sunak would not be drawn on whether he feared the possibility of Nigel Farage changing his mind and standing as a Reform candidate at the general election.  Mr Sunak sought to paint the election as a two-horse race between the Tories and Labour and argued that “a vote for anyone who is not a Conservative candidate is just a vote to put Keir Starmer in No 10”.  Asked how much he feared the possibility of Mr Farage standing, the Prime Minister told broadcasters: “At the end of the day on July 5th, one of two people will be prime minister, either Keir Starmer or me. “A vote for anyone who is not a Conservative candidate is just a vote to put Keir Starmer in No 10. “So if you’re someone who cares about tackling migration, both the boats and legal migration, if you’re someone who wants a more proportionate, pragmatic approach to net zero that saves people money, and if you’re someone who wants lower taxes, it’s only the Conservatives that are going to offer those things. And that’s the choice at this election.” He added: “Who would they rather see in No 10 on July the 5th, working on these issues? Is it Keir Starmer or is it me?”                      03 Jun 2024-12:07PM GMT                                         Sunak denies stoking ‘culture war’ on gender issues                    Rishi Sunak denied he was stoking a “culture war” with his pledge to amend the Equality Act to make clear that sex means “biological sex” rather than gender.  Asked whether he was waging a “culture war” at a campaign event in Oxfordshire, the Prime Minister told broadcasters: “No. It builds on our track record of treating these issues sensitively and with compassion, as of course we should, but ensuring that our laws are right, our guidance is right to protect the safety and security of women and girls and the wellbeing of our children. “And I think that’s paramount in all of our minds.”                      03 Jun 2024-12:04PM GMT                                         Sunak campaign visit interrupted by Lib Dem boat stunt                    Rishi Sunak’s campaign trip to Oxfordshire was briefly interrupted by a Liberal Democrat stunt. As the Prime Minister visited a riverside rowing club in Henley-on-Thames and spoke with female members, Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper and a group of activists rode past on a boat. The Lib Dem contingent, who were also campaigning in the same area, carried orange diamond shaped voting placards during the incident, waving them towards the Prime Minister and the media following him during the visit. Mr Sunak was joined on the visit by two Conservative candidates for nearby constituencies: Caroline Newton for Henley, and Lucy Demery for Wokingham. The Prime Minister cleaned down the hull of a rowing craft alongside club members, and stopped for a cup of tea on the riverside where he spoke with other members about their time at the club. Following the stunt, a Lib Dem source said: “This is just another small boat Rishi Sunak can’t deal with.”                      03 Jun 2024-12:00PM GMT                                         Pictured: Sunak scrubs down a boat during visit to Henley-on-Thames today                                         03 Jun 2024-11:38AM GMT                                         Tice refuses to rule out Farage standing as Reform candidate                    Richard Tice has refused to rule out the possibility of Nigel Farage standing as a Reform UK candidate at the general election.  Mr Farage said at the start of the campaign that he would not be standing but this morning he tweeted that he will be making an “emergency general election announcement” at 4pm prompting speculation he may have changed his mind.  Asked what the announcement will be, Mr Tice told Talk TV: “We are looking forward to that announcement at 4pm. We are having a great campaign so far. Very energised getting huge, huge positivity and returns. Sometimes patience is a virtue…”  Mr Tice, the Reform leader, said he knew what the announcement will be.  Asked again if Mr Farage is going to stand, he said: “Come along and listen at 4pm and you will find out everything.”  Reform UK leader Richard Tice refuses to rule out Nigel Farage standing as a candidate in the General Election ahead of an emergency announcement at 4pm.@JuliaHB1  | @TiceRichard pic.twitter.com/AUlreWlWEZ                      03 Jun 2024-11:28AM GMT                                         Streeting labels Tories ‘arsonists’                    Kemi Badenoch said she believed Rishi Sunak will be able to get the better of Sir Keir Starmer during general election debates.  The Business and Trade Secretary said that TV debates “can change things” and predicted “we will see a side of the Prime Minister we haven’t seen” .  Wes Streeting said the debates would highlight the choice on offer to voters at the election.  The shadow health secretary said: “The choice at this election is do people want to give the matches back to the arsonists to finish the job or do they want to look to the firefighters in the Labour Party that offer the change the country needs.”                       03 Jun 2024-11:19AM GMT                                         Shapps: Starmer cannot lead UK through ‘uncertain times’                    Grant Shapps claimed Sir Keir Starmer could not provide the UK with the “clear and bold leadership” the nation needs at a time of increasing global uncertainty after the Labour leader failed to give a deadline for increasing defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP.  The Labour leader said he would get to 2.5 per cent “as soon as possible” but the Tories have set a firm timescale of 2030. Responding to Sir Keir’s speech in Greater Manchester, the Defence Secretary said: “This was another empty speech from Keir Starmer. By refusing to commit to 2.5 per cent defence spending by 2030 he has been unable to show the clear and bold leadership this country needs in uncertain times. “Starmer’s choice for foreign secretary, David Lammy, has described the UK’s nuclear deterrent as ‘senseless’. This rubbishes the claim that Labour have changed. It’s clear Starmer lacks the courage and conviction to stand up for Britain’s security. “Only the Conservatives have a clear plan to deliver the bold action needed to keep Britain secure in a more uncertain world, including reaching 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence spending by 2030, the biggest strengthening of our national defence in a generation.”                      03 Jun 2024-11:08AM GMT                                         Farage announcement takes senior Reform figures by surprise                    Nigel Farage’s statement that he is going to make an “emergency general election announcement” at 4pm has taken even some of the most senior figures in Reform by surprise.

In a room containing regimental silver and portraits of commanding officers and Victoria Cross recipients, the Labour leader mingled with candidates and members of the Royal British Legion. A representative of the Royal British Legion gave Sir Keir a poppy pin commemorating the 80th anniversary of D-Day, which takes place on Thursday. Meanwhile, Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, was out campaigning on the party’s battle bus in Doncaster this morning.

Many readers have been quick to point out that some of the most senior figures in Sir Keir Starmer’s top team actually voted against renewing Trident back in 2016:                       03 Jun 2024-10:40AM GMT                                         Watch: Sir Keir Starmer’s defence speech in full                    Sir Keir Starmer used a speech in Greater Manchester this morning to set out his defence plans and to insist Labour is 100 per cent committed to maintaining the UK’s Trident nuclear deterrent.  He also failed to give a firm deadline for delivering on his pledge to increase defence spending to 2.5 per cent.

The Labour leader said he does still intend to repeal the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023.  The law offers a conditional amnesty to those accused of killings.  Sir Keir said: “Well, I am committed to repealing it and I will tell you for why. I worked in Northern Ireland for five years, working as part of the Good Friday Agreement to establish the Police Service of Northern Ireland and to ensure that that police service had the confidence of all communities.  “And that was a very successful piece of work, never complete in Northern Ireland, but a hugely important part of our history which is very important to me in terms of my journey.  “In relation to that legislation, for a government in Westminster to pass legislation which has the support of no political party in Northern Ireland and no community in Northern is in my view a mistake, particularly based on my experience in Northern Ireland. “I would actually dispute that across the armed services that they are all against repealing the legislation because it provides an amnesty for all sides, including the terrorists and I know that many people feel extremely uncomfortable about that.”  Johnny Mercer, the minister for veterans’ affairs, said this morning that Labour should look Northern Ireland veterans “in the eye and tell them you will restart their prosecutions”.  Labour going on Veterans today. Look the Northern Ireland Veterans in the eye and tell them you will restart their prosecutions. Because that is what you are promising to do. https://t.co/apZEm5Js31                      03 Jun 2024-10:07AM GMT                                         Labour not to blame for private school closures, says Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer said Labour’s plan to impose VAT on private school fees could not be blamed for private school closure s.  The Labour leader said: “I have seen a number of reports of private schools closing and if you look at the details it has got nothing to do with Labour Party policy at all.  “In fact, I think hundreds of private schools have closed over the last 14 years and it is about time that that was put into the mix when these stories are reported.”                      03 Jun 2024-09:51AM GMT                                         Is Nigel Farage about to change his mind?                    Nigel Farage said at the start of the general election campaign that he would not be standing as a Reform UK MP candidate.  Could he be about to change his mind?  His tweet promising an “emergency general election announcement” this afternoon has ignited speculation but, as my colleague Ben Riley-Smith points out below, Reform are not saying anything right now:  There are still four days to register as a candidate before the door slams shut.

Asked yes or no if he would push the button, the Labour leader said: “On the nuclear deterrent, it is fundamental, it is a vital part of our defence and of course that means we have to be prepared to use it.  “Now nobody who aspires to be prime minister would set out the circumstances in which it would be used. That would be irresponsible.  “But it is there as a part, a vital part, of our defence.

The Tories have said they would hit the number by 2030 but the Labour leader today could only say he would get there “as soon as possible”.  He said that under a Labour government “Britain will be fit to fight”.  Speaking in Greater Manchester, Sir Keir said: “Within the first year of a Labour government we will carry out a new strategic defence review.  “We are absolutely committed to spending 2.5 per cent of GDP on defence as soon as possible because we know our security isn’t just vital for our safety today, it is absolutely central to our success for the future.”                       03 Jun 2024-09:25AM GMT                                         UK ‘less safe and less secure’ after 14 years of Tories in power, claims Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer rejected Tory claims that the UK would be less safe under a Labour government.  He claimed that after 14 years with the Conservative Party in power the UK is now “less safe and less secure”.  He said: “Just before this election the Tories questioned this Labour Party’s commitment to national security and I will not let that stand.  “The people of Britain need to know that their leaders will keep them safe and we will. Furthermore, the truth is that after 14 years of the Tories we are less safe and less secure.”                      03 Jun 2024-09:21AM GMT                                         Starmer: ‘A new age of insecurity has begun’                    Sir Keir Starmer said the UK was now entering a “new age of insecurity”.  Speaking in Greater Manchester, the Labour leader said: “The post-war period is over and a new age of insecurity has begun.  “An era where the burden of history for people and nations will once again be heavier on our backs.”  Sir Keir said that national security is the “most important issue of our times” and if a Labour government is elected it will become “our solemn responsibility”.  He said that national security “will always come first”.                       03 Jun 2024-09:18AM GMT                                         Starmer praises ‘collective strength’ of D-Day veterans                    Sir Keir Starmer is now speaking in Greater Manchester.  The Labour leader started his speech by paying tribute to D-Day veterans.  He praised their “individual courage and collective strength” ahead of the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday this week. “This week and every week, we will remember them,” he said.                       03 Jun 2024-09:15AM GMT                                         Healey claims Tories have ‘shameful record’ on defence                    John Healey said that under the Tories the UK’s armed forces were now the “smallest since Napoleon”.  The shadow defence secretary said that many armed forces families were having to live in “damp, moldy housing”, relying on Universal Credit to get by.  “This is the shameful record of the Conservatives on defence over the last 14 years,” he said.  “Britain will be better defended with Labour,” he added.                       03 Jun 2024-09:11AM GMT                                         Healey claims Labour is now ‘party of defence’                    John Healey said the Labour Party has “deep pride and deep roots in defending this country” as he introduced Sir Keir Starmer at an event in Greater Manchester.  Mr Healey said that Labour is now “the party of defence”.  He said that this was demonstrated by the fact that 14 of the party’s general election candidates are ex-armed forces.                      03 Jun 2024-09:09AM GMT                                         Starmer joined by 10-ex armed forces Labour candidates                    Sir Keir Starmer has been joined at a campaign event in Greater Manchester by 10 ex-military Labour candidates.

Ms Rowling, the Harry Potter author, said the former Labour spin doctor had highlighted the party’s “complacency and indifference towards the rights of half the electorate”. Mr Campbell had questioned why Ms Badenoch, the Business and Trade Secretary, had spent her first broadcast round of the general election campaign focused on Tory plans to change the Equality Act.  Ms Badenoch also serves as the minister for women and equalities-something Ms Rowling pointed out: Badenoch is also Minister for Women and Equalities.

The Labour leader has agreed to face Rishi Sunak in a head-to-head debate hosted by Sophie Raworth in Nottingham on June 26. Sir Keir will also take part in a two-hour Question Time special with the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP on June 20.

An interview with the former prime minister was streamed last week on Lotus Eaters, a website set up by Carl Benjamin, who once said of Labour’s Jess Phillips that he “wouldn’t even rape” her. Asked whether it was appropriate for a Conservative candidate to appear on the platform, Ms Badenoch said: “Carl Benjamin is not standing for election, Liz Truss is. It is for her constituents to decide whether she has done a good job or not. “It is not for you, or me for that matter, to decide which shows she should be able to go on because the presenter may have said something inappropriate before. “We’ve had lots of scenarios of BBC presenters saying things that are inappropriate. “I don’t know about the show. I don’t know what he said. And I don’t like making comments on things like that that I don’t know. I think it is trivial, it is unserious.”                      03 Jun 2024-08:20AM GMT                                         Tories waging ‘phony culture wars’, claim Lib Dems                    The Conservatives are waging “phony culture wars” and there is no need to unpick the Equality Act, the Liberal Democrats have said. Deputy leader Daisy Cooper told LBC: “I think we need to see this announcement for what it is, and I do think this is a cynical distraction form their failings on so many issues, like the economy, like the cost-of-living crisis, like the NHS, like social care, like protecting our local environment and tackling the issue of raw sewage discharge. “I think the Government is failing on so many counts – time and again we have seen how it tries to wage these phony culture wars. “On the specifics of the proposal, Liberal Democrats have said that, of course, where there is confusion within service providers there could be better guidance, but I really don’t think there’s any demand to unpick, or any need to unpick, the Equality Act itself.”                      03 Jun 2024-08:08AM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak: ‘Biological sex matters’                    Biological sex matters.We're protecting women and girls.                      03 Jun 2024-07:56AM GMT                                         Badenoch blasts Labour over failure to mirror Tory gender pledge                    Kemi Badenoch criticised Labour after the party said it would not follow the Tories in vowing to make changes to the Equality Act.  The Tories are pledging  in their manifesto to rewrite the act to make clear that sex refers to “biological sex”.  John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, said this morning that Labour would not follow suit, arguing the move was unnecessary (see the post below at 08.43).  Ms Badenoch, the minister for women and equalities, responded: “Under Labour, biological men will be allowed access to women-only spaces. “Labour think protecting women is a ‘distraction’. This is no surprise – Keir Starmer has flip-flopped on what a woman is, he long campaigned to introduce gender self-identification, and today he is refusing to back our commitment to rewrite the Equality Act to make clear that sex means ‘biological sex’. “While Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have a clear plan to protect women and girls, it is clear Keir Starmer and the Labour Party will not stand up for women.”                      03 Jun 2024-07:43AM GMT                                         Labour would not follow Tories and amend Equality Act                    Labour would not amend the Equality Act if elected because there are already provisions to protect single-sex spaces, shadow defence secretary John Healey has said. Mr Healey said the Tories’ plan to make changes to the Act was “not needed”.  Speaking to Times Radio, Mr Healey said: “We will not want to amend the Act, it’s not needed. The Act, incidentally, was a Labour Act in 2010, that was opposed by the Tories, but it already provides protections for single-sex spaces for biological women. “It already provides a definition of a woman, and sex and gender are different. What is needed is clearer guidance for service providers, from the NHS to sports bodies, and in prisons, on what single-sex exemptions need to be, and the best way to be able to do that is in guidance, not primary legislation. “The Government has had 14 years to do that and it hasn’t. This, to be honest, is a distraction from the election campaign, where most people want to hear why the cost-of-living pressures are so great, what the Tories are going to do, and what Labour is going to do, to try and help make life more affordable and Britain better.”                      03 Jun 2024-07:38AM GMT                                         Labour frontbenchers voted to ‘castrate our security’, says senior Tory                    Members of Sir Keir Starmer’s current Labour frontbench voted to “castrate our security” when they voted against renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent in 2016, a senior Tory said.  Alicia Kearns, who was the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee before the dissolution of Parliament, said a dozen current Labour frontbenchers opposed renewal.  She tweeted this morning: “Not just some, *12* members of Starmer’s now frontbench voted in 2016 against renewing Trident. “12 people who decided they would castrate our security, and that of our allies, on the altar of Corbyn’s ideology. “This should be fundamental to electoral decisions. The foremost duty of the state is to keep our people safe. Their decision if successful would have made us, and the world, less safe.”                      03 Jun 2024-07:36AM GMT                                         Farage wants to ‘destroy’ the Conservative Party, says Badenoch                    Nigel Farage wants to “destroy” the Tories, Kemi Badenoch said.  Asked if she would serve alongside Mr Farage in the Conservative Party, Ms Badenoch said: “No, no, Nigel Farage has stood against many Conservatives, including some of my colleagues, what he wants to do is destroy the Conservative Party.” Mr Farage is campaigning for Reform UK at this election and is the party’s honorary president.  He said at the weekend  that he wanted to stage a “takeover” of the Conservative Party after the general election.                       03 Jun 2024-07:27AM GMT                                         Badenoch: ‘Putting on a different set of clothes does not make you transgender’                    Kemi Badenoch said that “putting on a different set of clothes does not make you transgender”.  The minister for women and equalities told LBC: “We want people to have privacy and dignity. This is about protecting those who are vulnerable, it is not about stopping trans people from having privacy and dignity. “That’s why we have said you should have unisex toilets, a disabled toilet is an example of that, or where there are shared spaces, they should be on the basis of biological sex.” She added: “Changing your clothes doesn’t change who you are, we want people who are trans to be protected as well, people who want to change their clothes should not be able to exploit the scenarios we have prepared and the laws we have put in place to protect those people who are genuine transgender people, those who suffer gender dysphoria. “Just putting on a different set of clothes does not make you transgender.”                      03 Jun 2024-07:19AM GMT                                         Starmer would press nuclear button, says John Healey                    Sir Keir Starmer would be prepared to push the nuclear button if he becomes prime minister, the shadow defence secretary insisted this morning.  John Healey said the Labour leader would “do what is required, if it is required”.  Asked if Sir Keir would be willing to authorise a nuclear weapons strike, Mr Healey told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “The importance about a deterrent is there is a deliberate ambiguity and Keir Starmer has said ‘I will do what is necessary to defend this country’ and that is an important message to any would-be adversaries.”  Asked again if Sir Keir would be willing to push the button, he said: “No one should doubt Keir Starmer… he knows what needs to be done to protect this country, he will do what is required, if it is required.”                      03 Jun 2024-06:59AM GMT                                         Badenoch: No single issue will dominate election campaign                    Kemi Badenoch suggested no single issue will dominate the general election campaign.  Asked what she believed the number one issue will be, the Cabinet minister told Sky News: “It always depends on individual circumstances. In this election it is about who we want to be running the country. Whether we want the party that has a plan, which is the Conservatives, or Labour which doesn’t have a plan.  “That is what people are going to be voting for. People will have their own specific number one issues.”                       03 Jun 2024-06:48AM GMT                                         NHS patients being treated in corridors is ‘appalling’, says Cabinet minister                    NHS patients being treated in corridors is “appalling” but not something that happens in every hospital, Kemi Badenoch said.  The Royal College of Nursing has declared a “national emergency” in the NHS, warning that patients are dying in hospital corridors. Asked about staff being forced to care for patients in corridors, the Business and Trade Secretary told Sky News: “I think that that is appalling. I do know that this is something that the Government has been working on.  “We have put more money into the NHS than ever before. We do understand that there are difficulties in certain hospitals. This is not the case, certainly in my constituency, for example.  “But this is one of the areas where we have been talking about ensuring that the NHS is delivering more for people given how much that we have been putting into it.  “Of course the scenario that the Royal College of Nursing is describing is not something that we ever want to see.  “We know that there will be specific issues in some areas and I know that the Health Secretary has been out just yesterday in fact talking about what our plans in this space will be.”                      03 Jun 2024-06:35AM GMT                                         Badenoch: Trans athletes with ‘unfair advantages’ should not be allowed to compete against women                    Kemi Badenoch suggested transgender athletes who have been through male puberty should not be allowed to compete against biological women in sports where they have “very obvious unfair advantages”.  The Tories pledged today that the Conservative manifesto will include a promise to rewrite the Equality Act to make clear sex means “biological sex”. Ms Badenoch was asked what the plans could mean for transgender athletes. She said decisions about who is allowed to compete are ultimately for sporting bodies to take but she said allowing transgender athletes to compete against biological women in certain sports and situations is “not right”.  She told Sky News: “What we are not doing is giving instructions to different sporting bodies. We are making it very clear what the law is. That there is a difference between identifying as a different gender and what your biological sex is.  “We believe that sport is something where there are sex categories for a specific reason. People compete in women’s sports because they are biological women, not because they identify as women.  “It is for sporting bodies to be able to manage that. Transgender athletes are not stopped from competing, they may in some cases have to compete with their biological sex, they may in some cases have open categories.  “But what we are trying to stop is the scenario where we see very obvious unfair advantages, people who have gone through male puberty towering over fragile and in some cases much smaller females and think that that is fair competition. That is not right.”                      03 Jun 2024-06:24AM GMT                                         Kemi Badenoch: Gender plans will stop people ‘misinterpreting the law’                    Kemi Badenoch said a Tory pledge to change the law to protect women’s spaces such as toilets and changing rooms would stop people from “misinterpreting” current rules around gender and biological sex.  The Minister for Women and Equalities said the Conservative Party would deliver a “clarification in the law”.  She told Sky News this morning: “What we are doing is making sure that people understand what the law says.  “We have seen a lot of problems with people misinterpreting the law.”                       03 Jun 2024-06:03AM GMT                                         Tice accuses Tories of ‘copying’ Reform on gender plans                    Richard Tice claimed the Tories were “copying” Reform with their plans to make changes to equalities laws.  Rishi Sunak is today announcing that the Conservative manifesto will include a pledge to rewrite the Equality Act to make clear sex means “biological sex”. The Tories argue this will better protect women’s spaces such as toilets and changing rooms (you can read the full story here ).  But Mr Tice, the leader of Reform UK, tweeted this morning: “Desperate Tories try to copy ⁦[Reform UK] again!  “Suddenly they’ve discovered what a woman is!

The Labour leader will be joined in Greater Manchester by John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, and the pair are also due to meet with military veterans ahead of the D-Day anniversary on Thursday.  Rishi Sunak will be out and about in the south east of England for a series of visits as he unveils a Tory pledge to change the Equality Act to define the protected characteristic of sex as “biological sex”.

In Scotland, the four main party leaders are preparing for a leadership debate on STV tonight.  The clash at 9pm between John Swinney (SNP), Douglas Ross (Scottish Conservatives), Anas Sarwar (Scottish Labour) and Alex Cole-Hamilton (Scottish Liberal Democrats) will be the first televised leadership debate of the UK campaign so far.                      03 Jun 2024-05:40AM GMT                                         Shapps: Starmer defence pledges ‘meaningless’                    Grant Shapps labelled Sir Keir Starmer’s defence pledges “meaningless” as the Labour leader today shifts his general election campaign focus to national security.  Sir Keir will use a speech later this morning to reiterate his commitment to maintaining the UK’s nuclear deterrent (see the post below at 06.36).  But Mr Shapps, the Defence Secretary, claimed Labour could not be trusted on defence.  He said: “Twelve members of Starmer’s front bench team, including Angela Rayner and David Lammy voted against Trident. We know Rayner is now making the decisions in Labour, so Starmer’s supposed backing for Trident is meaningless. “Labour’s refusal to commit to 2.5 per cent defence spending by 2030 shows that they are a danger to our national security. Uncertain times call for a clear plan and bold action to chart a course to a secure future only the Conservatives offer that.”                      03 Jun 2024-05:36AM GMT                                         Starmer: ‘National security will always come first’                    Sir Keir Starmer will today seek to reaffirm his commitment to a “nuclear deterrent triple lock” as well as his ambition to increase defence spending to 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). The Labour leader leader is due to make a short speech in Greater Manchester as he makes defence his priority at the start of the second full week of campaigning.  Labour is pledging three things on the nuclear deterrent:                                                                       The construction of four new nuclear submarines in Barrow-in-Furness.                                                                        The UK maintaining its continuous at-sea deterrent, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.                                                                        The delivery of all future upgrades needed for those submarines.                                                                 Sir Keir said: “National security will always come first in the changed Labour Party I lead. Keeping our country safe is the bedrock of stability that the British people rightly expect from their government.”                      03 Jun 2024-05:33AM GMT                                         Good morning                    Rishi Sunak will today vow to amend equality laws to prevent “confusion” on sex and gender, while Sir Keir Starmer will focus on defence as the general election campaign enters its second full week. The Conservatives have pledged to change the Equality Act to define the protected characteristic of sex as “biological sex”. They claim the change will make it simpler for service providers for women and girls, such as those running sessions for domestic abuse victims, to prevent biological males from taking part. The party says the proposed change to the law will not remove the existing and continuing protections against discrimination on the basis of gender reassignment provided by the Equality Act.  Meanwhile, Sir Keir will pitch Labour as the “party of national security” as he seeks to switch attention to defence. The Labour leader is expected to meet forces veterans and a group of his party’s candidates when he campaigns in the north west of England later today. Load-Date: June 4, 2024  End of Document
