   Farmers’ anger is increasing, outgoing union head warns UK governments telegraph.co.uk February 16, 2024 Friday 2:31 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:5 Length: 673 words Byline: By Emma Gatten, Environment Editor Highlight: NFU leader Minette Batters said that none of the three post-Brexit promises for farmers had been delivered Body   Dozens of tractors were involved in a go-slow protest in Wales on Friday as the outgoing president of the National Farmers Union warned anger is building among farmers. Minette Batters , who steps down next week after ten years in the role, said that farmers in Wales were particularly frustrated, amid the Welsh Labour Government’s green reforms  to the EU subsidy scheme and its ban on badger culling to stop the spread of bovine TB. “We have got to try and resolve these issues face to face and find consensus and agreement,” she said. “But it’s a fundamental right, that we should be very proud and feel privileged to have, that peaceful protest and free speech are ours to use. “Nobody wants to see the general public disrupted, but the anger is building in Wales.” More than a hundred tractors held up traffic on the A48 near Carmarthen in protest over the farming subsidy reforms on Friday afternoon. Some were seen carrying placards proclaiming “no farmers, no food”, in reference to an online campaign that has gained traction in recent weeks. On Monday, dozens of farmers drove their tractors to demonstrate outside the office of the Welsh rural affairs minister Lesley Griffiths in Wrexham, leading to one arrest. English farmers have also vowed to stage further protests, after a demonstration by around 30 in the port of Dover  last week over post-Brexit trade deals. Concerns have been growing in Wales over the Government’s proposed reforms to the EU-subsidy scheme, which will require 20 percent of farms to be used for trees and wildlife habitat. An impact assessment commissioned for the Welsh Government suggests a decline in labour of 11 percent, amounting to 5,500 jobs, although it suggests this may be reflected in farmers working fewer hours. The reduction is mainly the result of a predicted 11 percent drop in livestock numbers as a result of the policy, which is intended to help the Welsh Government meet its climate and nature goals. The Conservatives have warned that if expanded to the rest of England, Labour’s plans could mean the loss of 20,000 farms. Labour said they had no plans to follow the Welsh Government and would stick with the post-Brexit subsidy scheme introduced by the Conservatives. Mrs Batters criticised “the way the Welsh Government has treated farmers and the sheer panic that is building there now”. But she added that farmers had to be careful not to trigger the same level of public outcry as green protest groups such as Just Stop Oil. The protests in the UK come after several weeks of demonstrations by farmers in Europe , who have blocked motorways and attacked the European Parliament. Farmers in several countries including France, Germany and Belgium, are frustrated over the impact of climate and nature related policies, as well as low food prices and competition from cheaper imports. The organisers of last week’s farming protests in Dover said they would hold another protest on Saturday morning in nearby Whitfield over post-Brexit trade deals they say are undercutting British farmers. “We’ve taken a bit of inspiration from the French farmers and our counterparts in Europe,” said Andrew Gibson, who along with his brother Jeff runs a livestock farm and shop in Canterbury.                      Failed promises                    Mrs Batters said that none of the three post-Brexit promises for farmers had been delivered. “The promise was three things. The easiest trade deal in history with the EU – well that’s still problematic and still being resolved. “A bonfire of regulation – I’d say we’ve got more regulation. And a lot more money  because we won’t be paying it into Europe – we don’t see any signs of that yet. “So none of those three things really have gotten to fruition,” she said. Mrs Batters said the world for farmers was “a much more volatile one” than when she took on the role 10 years ago, with supply-chain crunches, and farming reform posing threats to food security. “Farming feels like it’s being used just for environmental targets. And we’ve got to do both,” she said. Load-Date: February 16, 2024  End of Document
