Unfortunately, it is also destructive, weakening institutions, damaging debate and making politics worse. It can threaten liberal democracy. The brexit saga is an object lesson in its dangers: it damaged what was long considered one of the world's most stable democracies.The recent book What Went Wrong with Brexit, by my colleague Peter Foster, sets out the story beautifully.  It shows how a classic populist alliance of zealots and opportunists mixed simplistic analysis with heated rhetoric and outright lies to undermine the country's most important economic relationship and threaten its domestic stability. Fortunately, there is an opportunity to learn and start getting things right.In fact, it was certain that brexit would go wrong, because it was based on false premises. Countries cannot be fully sovereign in trade, because trade involves at least one counterparty. Therefore, the single market rules were created because the alternative was multiple different regulatory regimes and thus more costly (and less) trade. One institution also had to decide whether countries complied with the rules they had agreed to. That has been the indispensable role of the Court of Justice of the European Union.The creation of the single market, then, was an act of regulatory simplification. Leaving it would increase regulation for any business trying to sell both in the UK and in the EU. Such businesses would inevitably be discouraged. Something that was certainly demonstrated. As Foster shows, smaller businesses suffer the most from these burdens.In the short term, existing businesses enjoyed sunk costs: their capital, knowledge and relationships. The costs of creating those kinds of assets anew are much higher than those of using the ones they already had. So, suppose a company considers entering the EU market today. All things being equal, would it make sense to locate in the UK rather than in any of its 27 members? Of course not. Then, over time, the separation will increase.This also applies to personal relationships, education, work experience or work as a creative person, consultant or lawyer. In short, this so-called liberation greatly restricts the freedom of many millions of people on both sides.Whose freedom increased? That of British politicians. They can act more freely than if they were subject to EU rules.What have they done with this freedom? They lied about (or, worse, failed to understand) what they agreed on the Northern Ireland Protocol. They threatened to violate international law. They even proposed to remove thousands of laws inherited from being members of the European Union, regardless of the consequences.In short, these people destroyed the country's reputation for sanity, moderation and decency. All this is a natural result of the classic populist mix of paranoia, ignorance, xenophobia, intolerance of opposition and hostility to institutions that constrain.However, all is not lost. Because, at least for now, some good things emerged. The ruling party peacefully got rid of two terrible prime ministers - Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. Their successor, Rishi Sunak, is no fan of fantasy. Neither is the leader of the opposition, Keir Starmer.Surely many now know that the challenges facing the country - inadequate infrastructure, slow innovation, low investment, poor corporate performance, huge regional inequalities and high income inequality - had nothing to do with the UK's membership of the European Union.Moreover, the opportunities for transformative global trade deals have proved to be a "wildfire." In Foster's words, brexit is "a colossal distraction." It is performative politics, full of sound and fury for nothing that means nothing sensible.Earlier I argued that rejoining the EU at this point would be a mistake, but it is possible to seek improvements in the UK's relationship with the bloc, particularly on the movement of people and workers and regulatory standards in food and manufacturing products.There is no good argument for divergence on the latter. Indeed, does a UK-specific regulation on artificial intelligence or a border adjustment mechanism for carbon make any sense? More boldly, there is a strong case for rejoining the customs union to remove the difficulties now created by rules of origin.The UK should seek to improve its relations with the EU. Its government must also act to improve its economic performance. If it fails to improve the trajectory, this populism may be back in worse shape. Nothing less is at stake now.
