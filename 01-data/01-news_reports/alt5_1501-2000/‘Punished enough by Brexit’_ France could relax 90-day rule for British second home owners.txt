   ‘Punished enough by Brexit’: France could relax 90-day rule for British second home owners telegraph.co.uk November 13, 2023 Monday 6:09 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: MONEY; Version:2 Length: 642 words Byline: By Ruby Hinchliffe, Money Reporter, Henry Samuel Highlight: Politicians across the Channel argue Britons should be able to ‘spend their money’ Body   France’s 90-day visa rule could be relaxed for British second home owners  after French politicians said they had been “punished by Brexit”. The senate, France’s second chamber, has voted through an amendment to the country’s new Immigration Law giving British second home owners the automatic right to a long-stay visa. Since Brexit, all British nationals – including those with a home in France – have only been able to stay 90 days out of every 180  without a visa. If they want to stay any longer, Britons have to apply for a temporary long-stay visa of up to six months. Martine Berthet, a French senator representing the Savoie area in the Alps, tabled a change to these rules after receiving complaints from British second home owners in her region. She said: “The Britons I have spoken to say that the current system is long-winded, difficult and full of pitfalls.” The senator also argued that keeping British citizens from contributing to France’s local economies would just add to an already-rising number of vacant properties in tourist areas. She added: “Ties are warming between France and the UK following the royal visit – and don’t forget, King Charles reserved his only official speech for the French Senate.  “The British are privileged partners of France. History has shown this to be the case.” The amendment still needs to be debated next month in the National Assembly before it is passed in the bill. But Ms Berthet said even if it fails to get through the National Assembly this time: “This is at the very least an important first step.” President Emmanuel Macron’s government – which does not command an absolute majority in parliament – has said it will not back the amendment. It argues that current legislation already makes it possible for British second home owners to stay longer than 90 days out of 180.  But wait times for visas have spiralled since Brexit. Nicole Gallop Mildon, partner at law firm Russell Cooke, said France’s visa centres are simply “overwhelmed”.  She added: “Before Brexit, they didn’t deal with Brits at scale. Now, they do and they are basically crumbling under the weight.” One way the exemption could work would be if British citizens with second homes in France were required to carry proof of property ownership when they travel.  Britons would then only need to provide these documents for the requirement of a long-term visa to be waived. The senate, which is run by France’s conservative party Les Républicains, put forward the amendment with signatures from 38 others across the party. Another amendment which would have offered similar rights to all foreigners with second homes was rejected by the senate, making the one which was put forward for debate tailor-made for British citizens. Philippe Bas, of Les Républicains, said last week: “Generally speaking they didn’t have anything to do with Brexit, but Brexit has punished them.  “They must be able to come to France and make the most of their second homes and spend their money.” Macron has already given thousands of local authorities powers to apply council tax surcharges of up to 60pc to second homes, the owners of which include 86,000 British nationals.  At the same time, for homeowners who live in their property, Macron has gotten rid of council tax altogether. Second home hotspots in France include ski capital Val-Cenis in Savoie, as well as seaside town La Tranche-sur-Mer in the Vendée. But France is not the only popular second home destination for British nationals. Thousands of British retirees have flocked to the shores of Portugal’s “golden triangle” of resort towns in the Algarve. The country issues residence permits for investment in exchange for property purchases of €500,000 (£432,000) or more.
