All Rights Reserved  Section: TV&SHOWBIZ; Version:7 Length: 823 words Byline: Owen Tonks For Mailonline Body   Meet the I'm A Celeb 2023 campmates                      Nigel Farage came to blows with Fred Sirieix during a heated debate about Brexit during Monday's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! Politician Nigel, 59, was the leader of the UK Independence Party from 2006 to 2009 and 2010 to 2016, and Leader of the Brexit Party from 2019 to 2021, with a referendum on Brexit being held in 2016. His previous work in politics prompted questions from his fellow campmates while sat in the jungle camp during Monday's episode, with many of his fellow celebrities disagreeing with his views on the UK's exit from the European Union.  Around camp, This Morning host Josie Gibson asked Nigel what former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who worked on completing Brexit after the referendum, was like, saying: 'What's he like on a personal level?' Former EastEnders actress Danielle Harold added: 'Forget politics, as a guy.' Nigel replied: 'Entertaining... in small doses. [He's] surprisingly introverted. You see this big act, fluffing the hair... surprising.' Josie asked: 'Is he quite a fumbler in real life, or is that just on the stage?' Nigel continued: 'I think he's one of the most disorganised human beings that possibly ever lived. The whole thing's bloody chaos. Shambles.' In the Bush Telegraph, Danielle said: 'I found it so interesting to listen, sat with him picking his brains, having a chat. Then it got a little bit heated.' Fred asked Nigel: 'What's the benefit of Brexit then? If you are an average person from Britain, what's the benefit?' Nigel said: 'To know that we're independent, we stand on our own two feet in the world.' Fred said: 'Brexit was about immigration, I remember your poster. I thought it was shameful what you did Nigel. Shameful.' Nigel replied: 'Sadly, sadly it was absolutely true. It was a poster showing mass young men moving illegally across borders.' Fred said: 'But it was about demonising migrants.' Nigel replied: 'No it wasn't. In your view it was, but it wasn't.' To which Fred said: 'It's not only just my view.' In the Bush Telegraph, Nigel said: 'I knew it wouldn't take long, I knew politics would rear its head as indeed it did. And Fred feels very strongly about it.' Having moved away to wash up, MasterChef star Grace Dent said to actor Nick Pickard: 'Brexit was his entire idea. It's his specialist subject. Fred's not going to change his mind on anything.' In the Bush Telegraph, Grace added: 'I would 100% rather wash up than listen to another single word about Brexit. I was just like, "Oh my god, I'm going to go and put my head in that stream."' Nigel also said: 'Brexit is about one thing and one thing only; being self-governing. We're in charge. We can get it right, we can make an absolute mess of it but we're in charge and the people who make those decisions we can hire and fire at elections where they have real power.' Fred said: 'I think the average person in the UK has lost out because of what you've done.' Nigel said: 'They haven't lost out.' In the Bush Telegraph, Fred said: 'Look, Nigel Farage is in the jungle with me. We're bound to have this conversation. At the end of the day nothing is going to change, Nigel believes what he believes, I believe what I believe. It was only a matter of time.' I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! viewers were left astounded during Monday's episode as they set eyes on Nigel's bum within minutes. The former politician, 59, further cemented his status as one of the most controversial figures in camp as he stripped totally naked in the famous jungle shower. Television personality Nigel wasted no time in whipping his clothes off to have a wash, leaving his entire behind on show. Walking through the camp, This Morning host Josie Gibson, 38, was stopped in her tracks as she set eyes on his cheeks, with the former Big Brother winner saying in the Bush Telegraph that she's 'seen worse'. However, viewers took to Twitter to express their astonishment after witnessing the scenes unfold.  One viewer asked: 'Josie how can you claim you have seen worse than Nigel Farage's backside?' While someone else wrote: 'Can't believe i've just seen Nigel Farage's arse.' 'In no other country would you see a politicians ass on national tv. WHAT,' declared another viewer. While someone else wrote; 'Oh my god I think I need to get therapy after seeing Nigel Farage's wrinkly naked a**e.' Someone else posted: 'Totally didn't need to see Nigel Farage's bum on national tv.' And someone else posted: 'My eyes my eyes they hurt #NigelFarage #ImACelebrity.' Someone else shared: 'Sorry did they expect me to feel bad for Jamie Lynn after burning my eyes with Nigel Farage's crease?????' 'I've just seen Nigel Farage's cheeks. I am truly traumatised,' declared someone else. And another viewer posted: 'Wasn't expecting to be facing Nigel Farage's cheeks as I sat down with a cuppa.'
