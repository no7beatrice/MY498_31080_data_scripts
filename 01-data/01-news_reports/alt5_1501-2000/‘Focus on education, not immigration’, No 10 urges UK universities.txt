   ‘Focus on education, not immigration’, No 10 urges UK universities telegraph.co.uk May 14, 2024 Tuesday 4:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 5562 words Byline: By Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor and Ben Riley-Smith, Political Editor Body   Downing Street has urged the nation’s universities to focus on “education, not immigration” following the publication of an official report  on foreign students coming to the UK. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “[Rishi Sunak] has said before that British students should be the priority for our education system and universities and student visas must be used for education, not immigration. “We are focused on driving down migration whilst ensuring the UK attracts the best and the brightest, and we will study the [Migration Advisory Committee’s] findings and outline our approach on the graduate route in due course.” The MAC, which advises the government on migration issues, has rejected calls to further slash the number of foreign graduates at UK universities.  It said the two-year graduate visa route was “not undermining” the integrity and quality of the higher education system and should remain in place. It said it found no evidence of “significant abuse” of the route which allows international students to stay in the UK for two or three years after graduation.

Zheng Zeguang was summoned for talks after three people were charged yesterday with spying for Hong Kong. In a statement issued this afternoon, the Chinese embassy said: “During the meeting, Ambassador Zheng made further serious representations to the UK side on the UK’s wrongful behaviour, including its unwarranted accusation against the (Hong Kong) government, and refuted the excuses made by the UK side. “He was unequivocal that the UK must stop anti-China political manoeuvring and not go further down the dangerous path of jeopardising China-UK relations.”                      14 May 2024-02:35PM GMT                                         Labour matches Tory’s £3bn-a-year Ukraine spending pledge                    Labour is ready to spend at least £15 billion on military support for Ukraine, the shadow defence secretary has announced during a trip to Kyiv. John Healey said he “fully backs” Rishi Sunak’s commitment to maintain the current level of lethal aid until at least the end of the decade. But he failed to say how his party would pay for the pledge, given that it opposes Tory plans to fund the extra assistance by cutting the Civil Service.

The Sustainable Farming Scheme was due to come in next year, replacing EU-era direct subsidies to Welsh farmers. But requirements for farmers to dedicate a fifth of their land to woodland and wildlife habitat had prompted a backlash from the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) Welsh branch and brought farmers out on the streets to protest.

A court ruled on Monday that large parts of the Illegal Migration Act should not apply in Northern Ireland because they breach human rights laws. The judge in the Northern Ireland High Court said the government’s Rwanda policy was not compatible with the Windsor Framework, the revised post-Brexit deal agreed between the UK and the EU last year. Speaking in the Commons, the former home secretary said: “In the decision, the judge found that section 7(a) of the Withdrawal Agreement Act, as amended by the Windsor Framework, must be read to mean that Northern Ireland is effectively to be treated as part of the European Union. “I believed the assurances made to me at the time, but isn’t it now patently clear that the Windsor Framework has operated in a way to undermine our sovereignty, to undermine Northern Ireland’s place within the United Kingdom, and I’m afraid has fundamentally failed upon its first contact with reality.” Home Office minister Tom Pursglove confirmed that the government was planning to appeal the ruling and would “not be deferred”.                      14 May 2024-01:38PM GMT                                         Poll: Majority of voters believe Sunak doing a bad job as PM                    A majority of voters believe Rishi Sunak has done a bad job as Prime Minister, according to a new Ipsos poll.  The survey, conducted between May 3-5, found 57 per cent of respondents felt Mr Sunak had done either a very or fairly bad job as premier.  Just 20 per cent said he had done either a very or fairly good job. Voters were asked to what extent they would say Mr Sunak had done a good or bad job as PM.  The 57 per cent number was Mr Sunak’s worst score on the question since taking office in October 2022.                      14 May 2024-01:23PM GMT                                         Poll: Three quarters of voters believe Sunak unlikely to win general election                    Three quarters of voters believe Rishi Sunak is unlikely to win the next general election, his worst rating since he became Prime Minister, according to a new Ipsos poll.  A survey conducted between May 3-5 found 75 per cent of people believe it is unlikely Mr Sunak will lead the Tories to victory.  Just 14 per cent said they believe it was either very or fairly likely that he will win the contest.  Voters were asked how likely or unlikely they think it is that Mr Sunak will win the next election. The 75 per cent number is the worst recorded by Mr Sunak during his time in No 10. Liz Truss scored 78 per cent just before her premiership ended in Oct 2022.

Prof Brian Bell, chair of the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), said that net migration could fall to between 150,000 and 200,000 by September because a ban on foreign students bringing dependents was having a far bigger impact than the Government expected. It would mean that Mr Sunak could go into the election claiming to be on course to meet Boris Johnson’s 2019 manifesto pledge of reducing net migration from its then level of 240,000 a year.

Anne Keast-Butler, who was appointed to lead Britain’s intelligence operations last May, has used her first major speech to highlight the growing threat posed by the Kremlin. She said GCHQ was “increasingly concerned about growing links between the Russian intelligence services and proxy groups to conduct cyber attacks – as well as suspected physical surveillance and sabotage operations”.

The former immigration minister said the graduate visa route should be scrapped as he warned it was being used as a “backdoor for foreign students to do low-wage work”.  He made the comments after the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), which advises the government on migration issues, rejected calls to further slash the number of foreign graduates at UK universities.  It said the two-year graduate visa route was “not undermining” the integrity and quality of the higher education system  and should remain in place. The route allows international students to stay in the UK for two or three years after graduation. But Mr Jenrick tweeted: “We urgently need to unwind the sector’s growing dependency on foreign students. The graduate route should be scrapped and we must fundamentally rethink our International Education Strategy (IES), including the completely arbitrary target of attracting 600,000 foreign students [per annum].  “The MAC’s review today endorses the route partly because the IES would likely fail without it. The MAC’s conclusions have clearly been constrained by the narrow terms of reference deliberately set by the government. If you order white paint, you get a whitewash.”                      14 May 2024-11:48AM GMT                                         Charging of three ‘spies’ is ‘deeply concerning’, says No 10                    Rishi Sunak thanked the police following the charging of three men with offences under the National Security Act. The Chinese ambassador to the UK was summoned to the Foreign Office this morning after three people were charged yesterday with spying for Hong Kong.  The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The charging of the three individuals under the National Security Act is deeply concerning and the PM thanks the police for their work keeping us safe.” He said he could not comment further on the ongoing case, but added: “More broadly, we are continuously monitoring possible espionage routes. “We have taken unprecedented steps to protect the UK from interference through the National Security Act to deter states from operating against the UK, but as you can appreciate I can’t get into the details on this specific case.”                      14 May 2024-11:45AM GMT                                         ‘Nothing will distract’ Government from getting Rwanda flights off the ground, says No 10                    Downing Street said “nothing will distract” the Government from getting Rwanda flights off the ground after a high court judge ruled asylum seekers cannot be deported to the country from Northern Ireland.  The judge said the Government’s deportation lawshould be disapplied in Northern Ireland  as it undermined human rights protections guaranteed in the region under post-Brexit arrangements.  The judge also said aspects of the Illegal Migration Act were incompatible with the ECHR.  The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The judgement changes nothing about our operational plans to send illegal migrants to Rwanda or the lawfulness of our Safety of Rwanda Act.  “We are continuing to work to get flights off the ground in the coming weeks. Nothing will distract us from that.”                      14 May 2024-11:35AM GMT                                         Gender identity ‘must not be taught as fact in schools’, says No 10                    Downing Street said the idea that someone can have a gender identity different from their sex “must not be taught as fact in our schools” because it is a “contested political belief”.  The Government is expected to publish updated guidance on relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) for schools later this week.  The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “As you will be aware the PM ordered a review of this guidance, this RSHE teaching in schools, following concerns that inappropriate content was being taught.  “We believe parents have a fundamental right to see materials being used in these lessons and the Education Secretary also made that clear when she wrote to parents in October last year.  “The review… will build on this, making sure that children are always taught sensitive content in an appropriate way.  “However, what I would say is we have been consistent that the idea that someone can have a gender identity different from their sex is a contested political belief that must not be taught as fact in our schools.”                       14 May 2024-11:26AM GMT                                         No 10 urges UK universities to focus on ‘education, not immigration’                    British students should be the priority for the nation’s universities and the sector should focus on education, not immigration, Downing Street has said. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “[The Prime Minister] has said before that British students should be the priority for our education system and universities and student visas must be used for education, not immigration. “We are focused on driving down migration whilst ensuring the UK attracts the best and the brightest, and we will study the MAC’s findings and outline our approach on the graduate route in due course.”                      14 May 2024-11:24AM GMT                                         Legal migration levels still ‘too high’, says No 10                    Legal migration levels are still “too high”, Downing Street said following the publication of an official report on foreign students coming to the UK. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “The PM has been clear that legal migration numbers are too high. We are working to bring those down.  “We have already seen a significant fall, a 24 per cent fall, following the introduction of reforms previously introduced.  “But he still thinks there is further to go. We are committed to attracting the best and brightest to study at our world class universities whilst preventing the abuse of our immigration system which is why we commissioned the Migration Advisory Committee’s review of the graduate route.”  No 10 said the Government will consider the findings of a new report by the Migration Advisory Committee. The MAC rejected ministers’ calls to slash the number of foreign graduates at UK universities.                       14 May 2024-10:47AM GMT                                         Pictured: Zheng Zeguang, Chinese ambassador to the UK, leaves the Foreign Office                                         14 May 2024-10:35AM GMT                                         Pictured: Sunak welcomes farmers to Downing Street for Farm to Fork summit                                         14 May 2024-10:19AM GMT                                         New Royal Marines ships would be ‘at risk’ under Labour, claims Shapps                    Grant Shapps claimed the Government’s plan to build up to six new ships for the Royal Marines would be “at risk” of being axed under Labour.  The Defence Secretary said building the new vessels was “only possible” because of Rishi Sunak’s pledge to increase armed forces spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2030.  Labour has not committed to the same deadline, prompting Mr Shapps to warn of “defence cuts” should the Opposition win the general election.  Here is his tweet: We have saved the Royal Marines' warships & will build the Commandos up to 6 more. This is only possible because we've massively increased defence spending. But Labour's defence cuts would put these ships at risk. https://t.co/G336HwpHiG                      14 May 2024-10:02AM GMT                                         Government warned slashing number of foreign graduates could lead universities to collapse                    Government migration advisers have rejected ministers’ calls to slash the number of foreign graduates at UK universities. The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) said the two-year graduate visa route was “not undermining” the integrity and quality of the higher education system and should remain in place. It said it found no evidence of “significant abuse” of the route which allows international students to stay in the UK for two or three years after graduation. The MAC concluded it was helping universities to make up for financial losses on domestic students and research through income from international tuition fees. It warned further curbs on foreign graduates could lead to course closures and “in the extreme”, the collapse of some universities.

Zheng Zeguang is understood to be meeting with officials rather than Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, or any other government ministers. The ambassador is expected to be challenged on allegations of foreign interference on UK soil. The meeting has been scheduled for 10.30am in the Foreign Office. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) spokesman, said: “Today, on instruction from the Foreign Secretary, the Chinese Ambassador was summoned to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.  “The FCDO was unequivocal in setting out that the recent pattern of behaviour directed by China against the UK including cyber-attacks, reports of espionage links and the issuing of bounties is not acceptable.  “The summons followed Monday’s announcement that three people have been charged with offences under the National Security Act as part of an investigation led by officers from the Met Police’s Counter Terrorism Command. The foreign intelligence service to which the charges relate is that of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.”                      14 May 2024-09:19AM GMT                                         Labour’s poll lead over Tories falls to 21 points                    Labour’s poll lead over the Tories has fallen slightly to 21 points, according to a new Redfield & Wilton Strategies survey.  The poll, conducted on May 12, put Labour on 42 per cent which was down by two points when compared to the company’s previous poll on May 5.  The Conservative Party was unchanged on 21 per cent.

The Defence Secretary said the suspension should kick in if the MP was charged. MPs narrowly voted last night  in favour of a change to parliamentary rules which will mean any MP who is arrested for a violent or sexual offence will face being barred from the estate. The Government had proposed the higher threshold of being charged but it was overruled by MPs.  Mr Shapps told Times Radio: “In the end, Parliament has made the decision, and I respect the votes in Parliament.  “Of course it could look at it again, if it needed to. But for me, it does seem to be just on the wrong side of natural justice and that’s why I voted to say you should wait for a charge.  “But there are passionate arguments in both directions. And I can see you can make that argument in both directions. I thought it’s slightly the wrong side of the line, parliament’s decided. That’s why we get to vote on these things.”                      14 May 2024-08:41AM GMT                                         World was ‘caught napping’ by Russia’s renewed offensive, says Shapps                    Grant Shapps said “the world was caught napping” by Russia’s renewed offensive in north east Ukraine. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Shapps said: “I really do feel the world was caught napping on this one. “I went to Ukraine and stood in Kyiv on my last visit and said this is a wake-up call for Ukraine because of the world, because this was going to happen due to the delays in getting Ukraine what they needed.” Mr Shapps said the situation in the north east of Ukraine was “obviously very delicate” and urged western allies to provide aid immediately. The Defence Secretary added: “My simple message is to the world, and in particular to the United States now given the package that has passed Congress, not only is it the right thing to do, it’s a lot cheaper to defend and therefore deter Putin here and now than it is to allow him to win.”                      14 May 2024-08:22AM GMT                                         Tories playing ‘economic whack-a-mole’, claim Lib Dems                    The Liberal Democrats claimed the Government had played “economic whack-a-mole for too long” as the party responded to today’s unemployment figures (see the post below at 08.45).  Sarah Olney, the Lib Dems’ Treasury spokesperson, said: “After years of economic chaos, these are concerning figures.  “The Conservative government has played economic whack-a-mole for too long, unable to grow the economy, and now too many face the prospect of losing their job. “The public has lost all faith in the Conservative party to manage the British economy. Our economy desperately needs a general election.”                      14 May 2024-08:13AM GMT                                         Labour label unemployment numbers ‘damning’                    Labour described today’s labour market statistics (see the post below at 08.45) as “damning” and claimed many people are still “locked out of work”. Alison McGovern, acting shadow work and pensions secretary, said: “The morning after Rishi Sunak told us his plan was working, these damning new figures prove that things are just getting worse: employment down, economic inactivity up and unemployment rising. “It’s no wonder there are now a record number of people locked out of work due to long-term sickness, given NHS waiting lists are spiralling and the Tories have pushed our NHS to its knees. “It’s Labour who have the plan to get Britain working by driving down waiting lists, reforming job centres, making work pay and supporting people into good jobs across every part of the country. Change with Labour can’t come soon enough.”                      14 May 2024-08:01AM GMT                                         Pictured: Sunak takes part in commemorations to mark 80th anniversary of D-Day                                         14 May 2024-07:57AM GMT                                         Hunt ‘confident’ more people will enter workforce                    Jeremy Hunt said he was “confident” the UK will start to see more people entering the workforce in the coming months as a result of Government reforms.  Responding to this morning’s labour market statistics (see the post below at 08.45), the Chancellor said: “This is the 10th month in a row that wages have risen faster than inflation, which will help with the cost-of-living pressures on families. “While we are dealing with some challenges in our labour supply, including pandemic impacts, as our reforms on childcare, pensions tax reform and welfare come online I am confident we will start to increase the number of people in work.”                      14 May 2024-07:45AM GMT                                         UK unemployment rate rises                    The UK’s unemployment rate has risen to its highest level for nearly a year as further cracks show in the jobs market, according to official figures published this morning. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of UK unemployment rose to 4.3 per cent in the three months to March, which is the highest since May to July last year and up from 4.2 per cent in the previous three months. Today’s labour market figures also showed regular average earnings growth remaining unchanged at 6 per cent in the three months to March.                      14 May 2024-07:42AM GMT                                         Shapps: UK will never ‘strong-arm’ Ukraine to accept peace deal with Russia                    The UK would not try to strong-arm Ukraine into accepting a peace deal with Russia, Grant Shapps has said. The Defence Secretary told Times Radio: “There is just no sense at all in which Britain would try to persuade, strong-arm or otherwise, Ukraine into accepting giving up some of their territory – that’s a decision entirely for Ukraine. “I don’t think it’s plausible at all for Putin to win this war.” He added: “If you give a bully like Putin an inch they’ll take a mile, and in this case they will take, probably he would take quite a lot of not just Ukraine, but I’m not sure he would stop there either... what Ukraine does and how it decides to bring this to an end is their business.  “What I can confirm is that the United Kingdom will back Ukraine all the way.”                      14 May 2024-07:30AM GMT                                         Renegotiate ECHR or walk away, senior Tory MP tells Sunak                    A senior Tory MP has urged Rishi Sunak to pledge in the Conservative Party’s general election manifesto to renegotiate the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) or walk away from it.  Mark Francois, the chairman of the European Research Group of Brexiteer Tory MPs, argued the ECHR was no longer fit for purpose and if it cannot be amended then the UK should quit.  He made the comments after a high court judge ruled asylum seekers cannot be deported to Rwanda from Northern Ireland.  The judge said the Government’s deportation law should be disapplied in Northern Ireland  as it undermined human rights protections guaranteed in the region under post-Brexit arrangements. The judge also said aspects of the Illegal Migration Act were incompatible with the ECHR.  Mr Francois told GB News: “I very much hope that these flights do take off. But fundamentally all of these legal roads lead back to the ECHR. So my personal view is that document was drafted over 70 years ago after the end of the Second World War for perfectly honourable reasons. But it’s now been overtaken by events. “I would like to see us attempt to renegotiate it. I’m sure the Italians would be up for that, the Poles and others would. But if that renegotiation were to fail – and I would like to see that commitment in the Tory Party manifesto, by the way-if that renegotiation were to fail, I believe we have to walk away. “And there’s no point going into a negotiation if the other side know you’re not prepared to walk away.”                      14 May 2024-07:18AM GMT                                         Sunak and Starmer are ‘so boring’ voters will stay home at election, claims Farage                    Nigel Farage claimed Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer are “so boring” that many voters will opt to stay at home at the next general election. The honorary president of Reform said he could not imagine the UK has ever had “two leaders going head to head for who’s going to be the next prime minister, who are, frankly, so boring”.  He suggested “very, very low turnout” at the next election would be a safe bet.  Mr Farage was responding to Mr Sunak’s speech yesterday on national security and Sir Keir’s reaction to it.  Mr Farage told GB News: “Well, I don’t know, in terms of style, I can’t imagine, perhaps I’m wrong, perhaps I’m being completely unfair. “I can’t imagine we’ve ever had two leaders going head to head for who’s going to be the next prime minister, who are, frankly, so boring. I think we can predict a very, very low turnout.”                      14 May 2024-07:11AM GMT                                         Nato would ‘outgun’ Russia ‘in every respect’ in a direct confrontation, says Shapps                    Nato would be able to “outgun” Russia “in every respect” if there was ever a direct confrontation between the two sides, Grant Shapps said.  The Defence Secretary also urged Nato allies to follow the UK’s lead and make a commitment to increase spending on their armed forces to 2.5 per cent.  He told Sky News: “The reason why comparisons about ‘how long would Britain fight against Russia’ are not actually the correct measure is simply that we are part of Nato.  “There is Article 5 that says that if one Nato country is attacked all 32 are effectively attacked and all 31 other countries would therefore have to come to our defence.  “That means we outgun in every respect Russia, for example, many, many times over and so our defence comes in the collective security of Nato and as part of Nato at 2.5 per cent we are by far and away the biggest spender in Europe and we are now encouraging actually other countries to follow us.  “So one of the messages that the Prime Minister and I will take to the Nato summit in July this year which is in Washington… is to say to other countries please come and match us, come to 2.5 per cent…”                      14 May 2024-07:03AM GMT                                         Shapps: Labour’s stance on defence spending ‘incredibly concerning’                    Labour’s failure to commit to increase defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2030 is “incredibly concerning”, Grant Shapps said.  The Defence Secretary told Sky News: “This big boost we are doing now shows how serious we are about it.  “I think it is incredibly concerning that the Opposition are wishing to 2.5 per cent but they have got no plan to get there and that is dangerous in the more dangerous world we live in.”                      14 May 2024-07:00AM GMT                                         Labour is a ‘danger’ to UK on defence, claims Shapps                    Grant Shapps claimed the Labour Party “presents a danger” to the UK because of its failure to match the Tories’ defence spending pledge.  The Government has made a commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2030. Labour has said it would try to hit that target but only when the economic circumstances allowed. Mr Shapps, the Defence Secretary, said Labour’s decision not to commit to a firm timeline would “send a signal” to the UK’s enemies that “we are not serious about our defence”.  He told Sky News this morning: “You can’t wish your way to more defence spending. You have to set out the plans and do it and that is why our plans now are fundamentally different to Labour.  “And I have to say as Defence Secretary with everything that I know in this role that I think that the Labour position presents a danger to this country because it will send a signal to our adversaries that we are not serious about our defence, if we won’t set out that timetable.” Load-Date: May 14, 2024  End of Document
