   Negotiators hold secret talks over Sunak’s Brexit deal telegraph.co.uk January 17, 2024 Wednesday 11:31 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:4 Length: 1126 words Byline: By James Crisp, Europe Editor, Joe Barnes, Brussels Correspondent Highlight: Officials hoped that confirmation from EU that its officials agree with UK interpretation of the deal could weaken the DUP’s opposition Body   British negotiators have held secret talks with EU officials over possible “wriggle room” in Rishi Sunak’s Brexit deal  for Northern Ireland in a bid to end the DUP’s Stormont boycott.  The discussions in Brussels were part of a doomed effort to broker a last-minute deal with the Unionist party ahead of Thursday’s deadline for fresh elections in the province after almost two years of deadlock. The DUP pulled out of Stormont in protest against the creation of an Irish Sea border  resulting from Boris Johnson’s initial Brexit deal almost two years ago. The senior British officials conceded there was no room for any renegotiation of the Windsor Framework , which currently sets post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland. Instead, Cabinet Office officials Mark Davies and Brendan Threlfall, as well as Lindsay Croisdale-Appleby, the UK’s ambassador to the EU, asked for the bloc for favourable language on the implementation of the “green lane”, a channel for British goods exported to the province with less border controls. “It’s on the implementation, the wriggle room, of how things are described and explained,” a source told The Telegraph. “There’s no room to renegotiate.” It was hoped that by securing confirmation from Brussels that its officials agree with the UK’s interpretation of the deal it could weaken the DUP’s opposition to the agreement. The DUP has had a long-standing demand that goods shipped through the green lane must be done so with the bare minimum of controls. The EU is not against finding ways to smooth trade as long as its single market is not put at risk by rogue products entering the province. Ministers had also prepared legislation offering to protect Northern Ireland’s place within the UK, a £3.3 billion financial package and a new East-West council to bolster intra-UK ties. But by last Friday, British officials were resigned that the Unionist party would not agree to a power-sharing deal almost two years after the devolved government collapsed. The working assumption in Government was that legislation would have to be drawn up to delay new elections as talks with the DUP continue. Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland Secretary, was due to call fresh Assembly elections by mid-April if power-sharing was not restored.                      No deal for public sector workers                    The DUP has resisted calls to return to devolved government despite the Windsor Framework , which reduced Protocol border checks on British goods entering Northern Ireland after Brexit. Failure to resolve the stand-off increases the chances of the deadlock lasting until after the next Westminster general election. A mass strike of public workers from 15 trade unions including teachers and nurses over pay is set to cripple the region on Thursday. Deals could not be hammered out for the public sector workers because Stormont is not in place to negotiate with them.                      DUP divided over financial package                    Labour, which is expected to deal the Tories their worst wipeout since 1997 , has said it will sign a veterinary deal with Brussels and discussed those plans with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader. Such a deal would reduce plant and animal health controls between Britain and the EU and Northern Ireland, which follows single market rules  to prevent a hard land border with EU member Ireland. The Government, which has already imposed stringent budget cuts on Stormont and slashed Assembly members’ pay during the impasse, is frustrated after a breakthrough failed to emerge last week. Mr Heaton-Harris is reportedly considering making its “generous” offer to the DUP public to increase pressure on the party, which is divided over the deal on the table. He held talks with Stormont parties on Monday over the financial package, which was boosted from an initial offer in an effort to tempt the DUP and includes £600 million to settle public sector pay claims but is conditional on devolution being restored.                      No timeline on return to Stormont                    Sinn Fein, which wants a reunited Ireland , won the last Assembly elections for the first time in 2022, toppling the DUP as the dominant political force. Michelle O’Neill, the party’s leader who would be First Minister if Stormont was restored, said there was no “chink of light” over a return to Stormont before workers from 15 trade unions in the 1.9 million people-strong region down tools on Thursday. Sir Jeffrey said that “significant progress” had been made in negotiations with Westminster over the border but gave no timeline for a return to Stormont. He called on Mr Heaton-Harris to release the public sector pay awards this year otherwise “it looks like the strike action will go ahead”. Mr Heaton-Harris said that if the executive was not restored by Friday, he would have some decisions to make. Polls suggest that if a fresh Assembly election was called, the DUP would retain its status as Northern Ireland’s largest unionist party.  That would qualify it to be one half of a power-sharing executive, meaning it could continue its boycott of devolution regardless of the election. The Northern Ireland Assembly was recalled on Wednesday in a last attempt to restore the executive. There was no cross-community majority to elect a Speaker at the sixth attempt, which brought the meeting to an end with Stormont still mothballed. DUP MLA Gordon Lyons branded the recalled session “cynically orchestrated” by Sinn Fein and urged the Government to release the funds for public sector workers now. “This recall is much like the five others that came before it. It is a stunt,” he said in Stormont. “It has been cynically orchestrated to coincide with the industrial action scheduled across our public sector,” Mrs O’Neill, Sinn Fein’s leader in Northern Ireland, accused the DUP of refusing to accept a nationalist First Minister after her election victory. She warned Stormont might never be restored unless Sir Jeffrey Donaldson left “suspended animation” and returned to power-sharing. “If Jeffrey Donaldson does not change his approach, then this sitting may well be the final one of this assembly. I fear that the democratic institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are in freefall,” she said. A Downing Street source said it did not “recognise this account” of events and claimed it was based on limited information. “Further progress in talks was made last week and the Government believes there is a very good basis for the restoration of power-sharing,” the source said. “As both the Government and DUP have said, significant and substantive progress has been made with the goal of strengthening the UK internal market and future-proofing Northern Ireland’s place in the economic union.” Load-Date: January 17, 2024  End of Document
