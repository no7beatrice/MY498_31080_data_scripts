   Brexit ‘caused rise in legal challenges’ thetimes.co.uk December 7, 2023 Thursday 1:00 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 498 words Byline: Jonathan Ames, Legal Editor Highlight: Ministers wanted to curb judicial review, but leaving the European Union appears to have achieved the opposite Body   Brexit has triggered a sharp rise in court challenges to the government despite ministerial efforts to crack down on “judicial over-reach”, according to Whitehall’s former chief lawyer. Sir Jonathan Jones KC, the former head of the government’s legal department, who quit in 2020 over a dispute with Boris Johnson, has said that after 13 years in office, the Conservative government has “failed to achieve its goal of curtailing judicial review”. In a paper published on Tuesday, the former Whitehall mandarin said “some of the reasons driving the expansion in judicial review are peculiar to this government, its behaviour, and exceptional events over the last ten years”. He highlighted the UK’s departure from the EU as the most obvious factor, saying that Brexit resulted in “the relocation of a vast number of decisions from Brussels to Whitehall, covering fields in which the UK lacked recent experience”. Jones argued that “inevitably, picking up hugely expanded roles in a short time frame resulted in more … challengeable decision-making”. Slightly more than three years ago, Jones surprised the government when he resigned from his top Whitehall legal post. At the time, he was said to have been “very unhappy” with the then prime minister’s attempt to impose a unilateral interpretation of how arrangements to avoid a hard border between Ulster and the Republic of Ireland would work in the absence of a formal trade deal with the EU. Commentators said at the time that Jones’s resignation put paid to a concerted attempt by Downing Street to play down the scale of the intended changes. In  a paper  titled                     A legal and political paradox: how a government determined to restrict judicial review ended up expanding it                    , Jones said the manner in which Brexit was implemented “particularly in its speed and the lack of a clear endgame” spawned a rash of court challenges. Jones pointed to figures he said demonstrated a “dramatic” trend in the rise of civil law judicial reviews. They showed that in the early 1980s, there were around 550 judicial review cases annually, including immigration cases. Jones pointed out that over recent years, there have been almost that many civil, non-immigration applications alone every three months. He added that the continuing ramifications of Brexit “suggest that the trend will continue despite the government’s efforts”. The lawyer, who since leaving Whitehall has taken a consultancy role at Linklaters, one of the City of London’s elite “magic circle” firms, said that as a result of the UK’s departure from the EU, “the civil service was sometimes asked to carry out, in a matter of months, law reform projects that would ordinarily take years”. Last year, Dominic Raab, the justice secretary at the time, published proposals which aimed to curb the power of judges in review proceedings. However he resigned last April after an investigation found he had been “persistently aggressive” towards parliamentary staff. Load-Date: December 6, 2023  End of Document
