   Easter travel – live: Bank holiday chaos as drivers face 20-mile queues on M4 and M5 and delays at Dover The Independent (United Kingdom) March 28, 2024 Thursday 9:39 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS & ADVICE,TRAVEL; Version:34 Length: 6783 words Byline: Athena Stavrou,Simon Calder and Tara Cobham Highlight: Travel disruption faces the millions of Britons hitting the roads and jetting abroad on Good Friday Body   The bank holiday travel chaos continues as drivers face up to 20-mile-long queues on major motorways as well as two-hour delays at the Port of Dover. Around 2.6 million car journeys were expected to be made on Good Friday as the Easter getaway got underway, with holiday traffic causing “significant” congestion around the M25 and roads in the South West and South East by lunchtime. Queues of 15 to 20 miles were seen on the M4 and M5 interchange near Bristol, which is adding 45 minutes to journey times. Meanwhile, the Port of Dover warned of two-hour delays on Friday afternoon. Huge queues could be seen building up there after ferry company DFDS reported on Thursday that its services were running with delays “due to strong winds in the Channel”. And once again there are long waits for French passport control at the Kent port, where frontier formalities are carried out before boarding ferries to France. Since Brexit, officials are required to scrutinise and stamp UK passports. It comes after plans were dashed as strong winds from the Spanish-named Storm Nelson hit the start of the wet long weekend, forcing the cancellation of trains, with almost 200 flood warnings and alerts remaining in place across the UK on Friday.

Around 2.6 million car journeys were expected to be made on Good Friday, with “significant” congestion around the M25  and roads in the South West and South East  by lunchtime. The RAC said holidaymakers heading south were behind much of the congestion after forecasters predicted sunnier spells there over the next few days.

The main line to Exeter, the rest of Devon and Cornwall has been closed since last night due to flooding between Newbury and Westbury.The rail firm is telling passengers: “The flood water has now subsided, however there has been significant damage to the railway infrastructure so Network Rail need to keep the line closed in order to make the railway safe. This disruption is expected to last until the end of the day.“Our high speed trains between London Paddington and the southwest will divert between Reading and Taunton.”The trans-Wiltshire railway from Westbury to Swindon is also closed.Local stations are being linked by taxis organised by GWR.Simon Calder travel advice: When to renew your passport before visiting Europe13:30 , Simon Calder, Travel Correspondent Since Brexit , the rules on passport  validity for British visitors to the European Union have tightened.Gone are the days when you could travel to the EU at any point before your travel document expired; the UK  is now a “third country”, with rules to match.Added confusion has come in the form of the UK’s own HM Passport Office, which has continued to give out incorrect information regarding child passport expiry dates.

The reality is that pretty much every UK airport is in the process of changing. So if you're coming to an airport, do make sure you still get your liquids and your laptops ready to come out of your bag.“If you come to [Manchester airport] Terminal 2 today, there's a reasonable chance you'll go through one of those new lanes, and that's great. It just means you don't have to take the things out of your bag.“We're in the middle of a £1.3 billion transformation programme. In the next 12 months we are going to spend half a billion pounds on improving Terminal 2, investing in those new security scanning machines and really pushing on to make Manchester airport the place the people in the North can be proud of.”Listen to the full episode here:March 29th -Manchester Airport reaches for the skies | Simon Calder's Independent Travel Podcast In pictures: Passengers descend on King’s Cross Station on Good Friday10:45 , Tara CobhamAlmost 200 flood warnings and alerts in place across UK10:10 , Tara Cobham Almost 200 flood warnings and alerts are in place across the UK.As of Friday morning, 163 flood alerts had been issued by the Environment Agency (EA), meaning flooding in those areas is possible, while 30 flood warnings were in place in areas where flooding is expected.In pictures: Cars pass Stonehenge in Wiltshire on A303 as Easter getaway continues10:07 , Tara CobhamAA warns electric vehicle drivers to have sufficient charge – or risk fines and penalty points10:04 , Simon Calder, Travel Correspondent The AA is warning drivers of electric vehicles to ensure they have sufficient charge – or risk fines and penalty points.Jack Cousens, head of road policy at the motoring organisation, said: “There can be some genuine reasons for running out of fuel or electric charge such as a faulty gauge, charging fault or undetected fuel leak."On occasions, cars may get stuck in jams for hours due to bad winter weather or miles of disruption leading to Channel ports which could result in running out of fuel or charge running low. Hence, we advise to always have at least one-quarter of a tank of fuel or sufficient charge to account for diversions if some chargers aren’t working.“Most of the out-of-fuel cases the AA sees are a result of driver misjudgement, and the police have the power to give a warning or a penalty if it is deemed to be careless driving or causes an obstruction. If you are running low, you can use the AA route planner to find the closest and cheapest fuel and the nearest charging point.”Met Office reveals weather extremes of Thursday after day brought ‘real mix'09:58 , Tara Cobham The Met Office has said Thursday brought a “real mix” of weather as it revealed the extremes of the day.The UK saw snow, hail, thunder, rain, gales and sunshine, as temperatures plunged to below freezing in some areas and as high as 12.5C in others.There was a real mix of weather on Thursday with snow, hail, thunder, rain, gales and even sunshine!Here are the extremes... pic.twitter.com/53V6COvjwe — Met Office (@metoffice) March 29, 2024 In pictures: Passengers at Manchester airport at start of Easter getaway09:54 , Tara CobhamOne of UK’s main motorway arteries, the A1(M), is closed today, warns AA president09:53 , Tara Cobham The president of the AA is warning that one of the UK’s main motorway arteries, the A1(M), is closed today.Edmund King has said the road is shut on Friday at J6 northbound between Welwyn and Stevenage for roadworks.He added that the M20 is slow towards Dover.A1M closed today at J6 northbound Welwyn Stevenage for roadworks.

The strike by members of the PCS union has been timed to hit the busiest days for arrival at the UK’s biggest airport. In a ballot that closed last week, PCS members who carry out immigration controls and passport checks at Heathrow airport voted by nine to one to walk out over a new roster and imposed changes to shift patterns. The union says the changes could see as many as 250 staff losing their jobs. The PCS general secretary, Fran Heathcote, said: “Ministers have 14 days to withdraw these unfair and unnecessary proposals or our members at Heathrow will take strike action. “Consultation with staff has been a farce, with our members having little or no choice about the new arrangements. “Ripping up flexible working arrangements is no way to treat staff especially, as the government says, their work is critical to our nation’s security. “Some members are heart-broken that the Border Force has become ‘unprofessional and inhumane’. “If the government is serious about border security, it should look at Border Force officers’ job security, look after its staff, scrap the changes and work with us to protect jobs and working conditions.” The Independent has asked the Home Office for a responseAirport packed for Easter getaway hopefuls as planes struggle to landThursday 28 March 2024 17:08 , Athena Stavrou Airports are packed with eager holidaymakers today as planes face difficulty landing amid extreme winds and heavy rain.Drivers, rail passengers and now jet-setters are facing travel chaos as many attempt to get their Easter weekend started.Two million holidaymakers are set to take flight over the weekend, with one airport bracing for “record-breaking” passenger numbers.Turkey, Dubai and the Canary Islands are among the most popular destinations amid wet and windy weather forecast for the UK, although trips to Dublin are also in demand.Travel trade organisation Abta said airports are reporting “strong numbers”, with 175,000 due to leave from Stansted, 105,000 from Luton, 160,000 from Manchester, 79,000 from Birmingham, and 89,000 from Edinburgh between Friday and Monday.Manchester Airport managing director Chris Woodroofe said: ‘It’s exciting that record numbers of people will be taking off from here this Easter: 320,000 people will travel (through the airport) over the bank holiday weekend -that’s up 7 per cent on April 2023.’It comes as dramatic footage showed an easyJet flight from Faro abort a landing at Gatwick Airport in heavy rain and strong winds at around 12:30pm.The Airbus A320 wobbles from side to side before pulling up again to avoid disaster.

Further train cancellations and delays                    Extreme flooding is wreaking havoc in the South West today as several lines are forced to close on one of the busiest travel days of the year. Great Western Railway said all lines are closed between Westbury and Swindon until at least 2pm. “Due to flooding across the railway network this morning, we need to reutilise the Melksham line for other purposes,” it said. “As a result trains between Westbury and Swindon via Melksham are suspended until further notice.” There have also been delays and cancellations between Swindon and Bristol Parkway, Westbury and Weymouth, Reading and Taunton and Sindon and Chippenham.                      Severe delays on the M1                    There are reports of severe delays on the M1 northbound between junctions J25 and J27. According to AA, motorists are facing delays of 44 minutes with an average speed of five mph. It is expected to clear later this morning.                      Chaos on Great Western Railway                    On one of the busiest days of the year for rail travel, flooding is causing chaos on the Great Western Railway between London Paddington, southwest England, Bristol and South Wales. The line between Reading and Taunton is partially blocked with disruption expected until the rest of the day. GWR said: “We are sorry for the delay to your journey today. Flooding on the railway between Reading and Taunton has resulted in some signal failures along this route. Network Rail are working to rectify the faults. This means that our high speed services between Reading and Taunton have to run at reduced speeds through the affected areas. The line towards Taunton is now blocked due to further flooding. “Our high speed services from London Paddington towards Devon and Cornwall will be diverted between Reading and Taunton which will add delay to your journey.” Unfortunately the main diversion route is also experiencing problems. High-speed trains heading west from Swindon in Wiltshire to Bristol and Cardiff are having to reduce their speed from 125mph to just 5mph as a result of flooding on the line.  “Trains may be delayed by up to 30 minutes, cancelled or diverted as a result,” says National Rail.                      Easter travel chaos: how bad will it be?                    The great Easter  getaway could see travellers caught up in delays by road , ferry, rail and air.  In a normal year there would be a gap between most schools breaking up and the long weekend. But with Easter falling so early the two are combined.  My colleague Simon Calder has explained the Easter travel situation and how bad it might be:                      Windy weather in Cornwall as millions head off on getaways                    Around 14 million Britons are due to hit the road today as many head off on their Easter getaways. Many will be heading for staycations in popular UK holiday spots such as Devon and Cornwall. However, pictures from Cornwall this morning show some windy and gloomy conditions. The Met Office has issued a weather warning for wind today in some parts of the south of England and showers are expected throughout the weekend.                      Welcome to our liveblog                    Good morning and welcome to The Independent’s liveblog on the Easter bank holiday traffic. Huge delays are expected on the roads this afternoon as many head off on their weekend getaways. Rail passengers have also been affected by cancellations and engineering works. We’ll be bringing you the latest news as it happens.                       14 million to hit the road this Easter bank holiday weekend                    Drivers have been warned of huge traffic delays as millions of people are set to hit the road this bank holiday weekend. The RAC warned journeys on the road could take up to twice as long as usual as 14 million people are expected to set off. “With Easter falling earlier than usual at the start of the school holidays, it could be carmageddon for holidaymakers,” an RAC breakdown spokesperson said. Journeys on the M25 between the M23 for Gatwick and the M1 in Hertfordshire are expected to take more than two hours, while the M5 southbound between Bristol and Taunton is also likely to be congested.                      Warning over Easter ‘carmageddon’ traffic chaos – which day will see the worst traffic?                    Drivers are being warned of chaos on roads over the Easter  weekend, with as many as 18.5 million car trips planned at the start of school holidays.  Those setting out on their journeys are likely to encounter delays from Thursday 28 March, when children break up at the end of term, into Good Friday, with one specialist warning that it could be “carmageddon” for those making their getaways. The overall travel  picture should not be as bad as in 2023, when the Easter weekend coincided with strikes  that led to the cancellation and delays of dozens of flights and widespread rail engineering work. These are the worst days for Easter traffic after ‘carmageddon’ warning Load-Date: March 29, 2024  End of Document
