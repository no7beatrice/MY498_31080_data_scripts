   Farage is ‘right’ that immigration is a major issue, admits Sunak telegraph.co.uk June 12, 2024 Wednesday 7:48 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 13703 words Byline: By Dominic Penna, Political Correspondent and Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor and Timothy Sigsworth Body   Rishi Sunak has said that Nigel Farage  is “right” to highlight immigration as a major issue but admitted that he has only met the Reform UK leader once. The Prime Minister made the remarks in an interview with ITV which he returned early from D-Day  commemorations to record, sparking major controversy. Speaking to the broadcaster he insisted that voters who “care about migration” should vote for the Tories on July 4 because he has a plan to stop the boats. Asked what he admired about Mr Farage , he said: “I’ve got respect for Nigel. It’s right that he’s highlighted migration as an issue because I think it is an issue.” But pressed further on his respect for the Reform leader, he added: “I really don’t know him. I think I’ve met him maybe once in my life.” Mr Farage is a popular figure amongst many on the right of the Tory party, who have said that they agree with his tough stance on immigration. Reform is almost neck-and-neck with the Conservatives in the polls, but Mr Sunak insisted that a vote for the right-wing party was a vote to put Sir Keir Starmer in No 10.

That’s not what I’m focused on. “At the end of the day, we’re working as hard as we can, and if you can look yourself in the mirror at night and sleep with a clear conscience...” Mr Sunak concluded by saying he was “prepared to do what I think is right for this country, even if it’s not easy, even if people criticise me”.                      12 Jun 2024-06:23PM GMT                                         Sunak: Social care fix will take time                    Rishi Sunak said it was “going to take time” for social care and the NHS to recover from the pandemic. Asked what the plan was now to tackle social care, he said “we’ve got more money going into the system, but how we use it is important”. Mr Sunak said it was “not the right moment” to reverse Liz Truss’s National Insurance cuts. “I don’t think it’s the right thing to put up people’s taxes. If the answer is putting up people’s taxes, I don’t think that’s the right thing to do.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:21PM GMT                                         Sunak on social care                    “So, what we did immediately after I became Prime Minister was provide about eight and a half billion pounds of funding for social care and the NHS. “The areas that we focused on were the workforce, who do an incredible job. Over a million people work in social care. And what they’ve always said to me is that what they wanted was obviously decent pay. And the National Living Wage has now been rising at quite a healthy rate over the last couple of years. “If you talk to anybody who works particularly in hospitals and in social care, they will say, if we can improve that, making it easier for people to leave hospitals and come back to their families or the community, not only is it better for them and their care and their recovery, it also helps us improve waiting times in hospitals.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:21PM GMT                                         Pensioners will pay taxes under Labour, warns Sunak                    Rishi Sunak said if he was re-elected, the Conservatives would raise the personal allowance for pensioners as part of the ‘triple-lock plus’. “Labour has not matched that pledge. There’s a very clear difference at this election. Pensioners for the very first time in history will be paying taxes under a Labour government.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:20PM GMT                                         Prime Minister defends Labour £2,000 tax claim                    Asked about Labour accusing him of lying over his claim the opposition would put taxes up by £2,000, Rishi Sunak told ITV: “I think it’s pretty desperate stuff. And Keir Starmer and the Labour Party are obviously very rattled that we’ve exposed their plans to raise tax on people. And that’s what it, that’s what it demonstrates.” Challenged on whether he knew his claim was “dubious”, he replied: “No, I don’t. I think people know that I’m across the detail when it comes to numbers. The Chancellor gave a press conference on this very topic almost a month ago where he laid out all the workings behind what we were saying. And I’m happy to go through it.  “I can tell you exactly, I’m happy to go through it with you. There are 27 different policies that go into this number. 21 of them have been costed independently by Treasury officials. “They’re all online and people can find them. Two of them come direct from the Labour party, three of them from other public government sources. And one of them is from an independent investment bank. That’s where all the workings come from. I don’t think the right thing to do is raise people’s taxes.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:19PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak: I don’t feel threatened by Nigel Farage                    Rishi Sunak told ITV’s Paul Brand: “I’ve been saying I want to bring immigration since the day I got this job, because it’s too high and immigration that’s too high puts pressure on public services, and that’s unfair.” Asked what he thought about Reform leader Nigel Farage, the Prime Minister replied: “I’ve got respect for Nigel... It’s right that he’s highlighted migration as an issue because I think it is an issue. And the choice for everybody is a vote for anyone who’s not a Conservative candidate is ultimately a vote to put Keir Starmer in office. “Now, if you are someone who cares about migration as an issue and wants to stop the boats, I’ve got a plan to do that.” Pressed on Mr Farage’s “best qualities”, he said: “I really don’t know him. I think I’ve met him maybe once in my life.” Asked if he felt “threatened” by Mr Farage, Mr Sunak replied: “No. I’m talking to everyone across the country about my plans for this country.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:14PM GMT                                         Sunak: We’ve been hit by two once-in-a-century crises                    Rishi Sunak said: “We’ve been hit by two once-in-a-century crises, a pandemic we hadn’t seen before and an energy crisis as Russia invaded Ukraine. “When I look back over the last 14 years, I am very proud of the progress that we have made as a Conservative Government.” Mr Sunak noted English schoolchildren are now the best readers in the western world, “which should be a source of enormous pride for us... Those reforms have benefited people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds the most.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:12PM GMT                                         Sunak: You can judge me by my actions                    Asked what he did to “walk in people’s shoes” regarding his personal wealth, Rishi Sunak said: “During the pandemic, was I going to lose my job? No, of course I wasn’t... That didn’t stop me from understanding immediately how damaging that pandemic and shutting down the economy and the country was gonna be for people’s livelihoods, and creating the furlough scheme to support them. “I did the right thing for the country and that’s what I’ll always do.” Mr Sunak said he last went to the supermarket in his constituency “a few weeks ago”, adding: “I do when I can get there.” Asked whether he had “gone without”, he said: “My family emigrated here, they came here with very little... We went without lots of things because my parents wanted to put all their money into my education. Like lots of people, there’ll be all sorts of things that I would’ve wanted as a kid that I couldn’t have. “Famously, Sky TV, so that was something that we never had growing up actually. But it was lots of things but again, that’s my experience... What is more important are my values and how I was raised. You had to work very hard, family was important, service to your community was very important, and I think that’s a good thing. If people do work hard, they should get to enjoy the benefits of that. You can just judge me by my actions at the end of the day.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:09PM GMT                                         ‘He was in two minds’                    Kevin Hollinrake, one of Rishi Sunak’s staunchest allies, said Mr Sunak was in two minds about a second Tory leadership run after the fall of Liz Truss. “He definitely was thinking it’s been a difficult time, particularly throughout the leadership campaign. “He definitely hadn’t ruled it out but he was in two minds as to whether he should do it or not.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:07PM GMT                                         Gove: Sunak put his career on the line over Brexit                    Michael Gove, the Housing Secretary, said he had heard about Rishi Sunak as an “amazing young guy” during his time as a junior think tank researcher. Mr Sunak succeeded Lord Hague, the former Tory leader, in 2015. Kevin Hollinrake, the neighbouring constituency MP, said his first impression of Mr Sunak was “this person’s going places, this person is a cut above what you’d expect from a new Member of Parliament.” Mr Gove said: “When the Brexit referendum came, he followed his heart and he put his career on the line.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:04PM GMT                                         Sunak: On reflection, it was a mistake to leave D-Day early                    Rishi Sunak had been in Normandy at a British-led veterans event on the day of his ITV interview. He sent Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, to a world leaders’ event so he could come home to record the interview. “On reflection, that was a mistake and I apologise,” Mr Sunak said the following since.                      12 Jun 2024-06:02PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak: ‘Incredible’ D-Day commemorations ‘ran over’                    Rishi Sunak’s interview with ITV News editor Paul Brand was recorded last Thursday (June 6), and Mr Sunak left D-Day commemorations early in Normandy to record the exchange. The Prime Minister arrived on set out of shot and was greeted by ITV News editor Paul Brand. In response, Mr Sunak said: “Gosh, hello. Very nice to see you. Sorry to have kept you.” Asked about the D-Day ceremony in Normandy during introductory pleasantries, the Prime Minister appeared flustered as he looked around the room and took his seat. “Yeah it all just ran over…it was incredible, but it just ran over everything, so apologies for keeping you,” he said. Mr Brand responded by saying: “I’m sure it was a powerful trip”, highlighting the added poignancy of the 80th anniversary of the landings coinciding with the war in Ukraine. Mr Sunak said: “I haven’t seen President Biden’s remarks but that’s kind of the echo I think of what he said.” Asked if he got to meet any of the veterans who attended the commemoration event, Mr Sunak said: “Oh my God, lots. Yesterday and today. Yeah, I probably spoke to almost everyone that was there, I hope.”                      12 Jun 2024-05:56PM GMT                                         Coming up                    Rishi Sunak is to face a grilling from ITV’s Paul Brand on the channel’s flagship Tonight programme.

Rishi Sunak has sat on this information for more than a week but has lacked any backbone to take action. Once again Rishi Sunak has been exposed as utterly weak.“After all the Tory financial scandals, this is more evidence that the Tories have learned nothing, haven’t changed, and if given five more years, the chaos will just continue. “Britain has the chance to turn the page on this failed Tory government which will heap £4,800 onto people’s mortgages. It’s time to rebuild with Labour.”                      12 Jun 2024-05:35PM GMT                                         Kamal Ahmed and Camilla Tominey on Ed Miliband’s new TikTok career                    Where has Ed Miliband been? @kamalahmednews  and @CamillaTominey  react to the Shadow Energy Secretary's burgeoning TikTok career Listen: https://t.co/5ntJ1ZzSzr pic.twitter.com/jqjD2YsYhS                      12 Jun 2024-05:22PM GMT                                         ‘Tearful’ parents forced to remortgage under Labour’s private school tax raid                    Parents are remortgaging their homes to raise money for school fees over fears a Labour government would push them to “breaking point”. The party has pledged to end the VAT exemption for independent schools, which could add 20pc to fees as early as September. Sir Keir Starmer has promised to spend the £1.7bn he claims the policy will raise on recruiting 6,500 new state school teachers. However, David Boddy, chair of ASIS, a business consultancy for the education sector, said he had spoken to parents “with tears in their eyes”, many of whom had decided to take out large loans to provide a buffer against rising fees.

Craig Williams, who is seeking re-election in Montgomeryshire and Glyndwr, issued a statement on X in the past few minutes. “I’ve been contacted by a journalist about Gambling Commission inquiries into one of my accounts and thought it best to be totally transparent,” he said. “I put a flutter on the general election some weeks ago. This has resulted in some routine inquiries and I confirm I will fully cooperate with these. “I don’t want it to be a distraction from the campaign. I should have thought through how it looks.” You can read more on this breaking story here                      12 Jun 2024-04:53PM GMT                                         Andrew Neil criticises Starmer over claim he ‘certainly’ didn’t have Sky TV                    I launched Sky TV in 1989, by which time Starmer was 27 — so obviously he didn't have Sky growing up. Nobody his age did since it didn't exist. Also, as the first Executive Chairman of Sky I can tell you with authority that working class families were the first to adopt it. https://t.co/M2mRLmvdUa                      12 Jun 2024-04:42PM GMT                                         The format of tonight’s Sky leaders’ event                    Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak will face 20-minute interviews and then 25 minutes of questions from audience members from Grimsby and across the country, writesGenevieve Holl-Allen. The Labour leader told reporters during a visit in Grimsby earlier in the day that he hoped the format would allow “more space for answers to be developed” than the ITV head-to-head debate last week. Labour need an 11.7 point swing to win this newly-merged constituency back from the Tories, and Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, which incorporates the previous constituency of Great Grimsby, is set to be a bellwether seat.  Grimsby turned Conservative in 2019 for the first time since the end of the Second World War, with Lia Nici serving as MP.                      12 Jun 2024-04:35PM GMT                                         Penny Mordaunt: Britain must be ready to leave ECHR                    Penny Mordaunt has said Britain must be prepared to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) if it is not reformed, writesCharles Hymas. The Commons leader told The Telegraph that “as someone who campaigned to leave the EU, if you want to reform the practices of such institutions you have to be prepared to leave them. I would, as my record shows.” Her declaration is more explicit than other Cabinet ministers and the Conservative manifesto which simply states that a Tory Government would choose the UK’s border security over the “jurisdiction of a foreign court, including the European Court of Human Rights.” Rishi Sunak failed to say he would be prepared to pull out of the ECHR if it failed to reform when challenged over the issue at the manifesto launch on Tuesday.

Under the “family business tax guarantee”, set out by Jeremy Hunt, the Tories are promising no rise in employer NI, capital gains tax or corporation tax. Mr Hunt said: “Ultimately it’s not businesses that pay taxes, it’s people. That’s why we’re guaranteeing not to raise taxes on businesses and jobs in the next parliament, and I’m challenging Labour to rule these tax hikes out too.  “If they don’t, this is just further proof that Labour is planning to fill the £38.5 billion black hole in their spending promises by hiking taxes by at least £2,094 for every working family. So if you think Labour will win, start saving.”                      12 Jun 2024-04:24PM GMT                                         Labour VAT raid ‘could shut half of small prep schools within a year’                    Half of small prep schools could close within a year of Labour taking office because of the party’s proposed VAT raid , the sector’s leader has warned. Our senior Henry Bodkin has more detail : Dominic Norrish, the chief executive of the Independent Association of Prep Schools (IAPS), said that vast numbers of traditional junior schools, many in rural settings, would become unviable “overnight” if faced with demands for the 20 per cent tax. Approximately 500 prep schools in the UK cater for 200 or fewer pupils. Many of these operate on fine margins and it is suspected that a significant proportion are already operating at a loss.Mr Norrish said that because independent schools were wary of revealing financial vulnerability for fear of putting off parents, Labour had “no idea” what damage their flagship election pledge could wreak.Approximately 250 schools comprising a total of about 50,000 pupils are feared to be at immediate risk.                      12 Jun 2024-04:21PM GMT                                         Reform ‘raises £1.5m’ since Farage’s return                    Reform UK has raised £1.5m since Nigel Farage returned as party leader last week, it has been reported. Around 14,000 members have joined in the past seven days, taking party membership to 45,000. There have also been significant donations from a number of private backers, according to the Guardian. Holly Vallance, the actress and singer, is among those said to have contributed to Reform’s election war chest.                      12 Jun 2024-04:10PM GMT                                         How Britain’s economy went from ‘gangbusters’ to flatlining                    When the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) chief economist described Britain’s growth at the start of the year as “gangbusters”, Rishi Sunak wasted no time in taking advantage, writesMelissa Lawford. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme in May, the prime minister pointed to it as evidence that his economic plan was working. “The facts are the facts,” Sunak said. “I think he used the term ‘gangbusters’, so I will leave it at that.” At the time, figures had shown the economy expanded by 0.6pc in the first quarter of the year. But just a month after that much-heralded data, the picture is very different. New gross domestic product (GDP) figures published on Wednesday show the economy has flatlined. : The figures that hurt Sunak’s claim the UK has ‘turned a corner’                      12 Jun 2024-03:56PM GMT                                         ‘Even worse than Greens’ awful manifesto is just how very boring they are’                    The bleakly surreal Tory manifesto unveiling yesterday felt like the away-day of a laggard legacy firm on the brink of administration, writesSherelle Jacobs. The Green Party launch today, in contrast, channeled the vibes of an overvalued startup’s calamity “crunch” shareholder meeting. It has been evident for some time that as eco-anxiety loses its edge in an era consumed by more immediate existential crises like stagnation, and a possibly looming Third World War, the much-hyped green movement is struggling to maintain its momentum.  With the Left torn between a formidable sense of ethical responsibility to make an environmental stand in the ballot box and delicious temptation to bludgeon the Tories into oblivion with a thwacking Labour supermajority, the Greens in this election are facing an uphill struggle to stay relevant. Today did not feel like a breakthrough.

Perhaps you were a lowly administration assistant in a local firm or stacking supermarket shelves overnight, writesLauren Shirreff. Or perhaps you had slightly grander ambitions, very much like the bunch of 20-somethings that are standing in July’s election. For this summer, Gen Z will make its full political debut.  Generation Z – the bracket of people born in 1997 to 2012, making them no older than 27 today – had just one representative before parliament was dissolved last month: “baby of the house” Keir Mather, 26, the MP for Selby and Ainsty.  But now, at least 15 Labour parliamentary candidates at the forthcoming election will be in their early 20s, with many others the same age running for the Lib Dems, Greens, Conservatives or the Scottish National Party, and for other small parties or as independents.

Do you want the guy who isn’t clear on whether terrorists should be able to come back to the UK to be in No 10? Do you want the guy who has also been appointing people who voted against our nuclear deterrent to be the guy who is responsible for the ultimate protection of the British people?” Mr Tugendhat added: “I am not drawing up any white flags, I am fighting right up to the end. Because this is far too important to concede on and we will not give up. “We have to get taxes down, and that’s exactly what we are promising, that’s exactly the commitment we’re making, but we can only make that commitment if we get over the line. You don’t need me to tell you, because you know it, but what’s Margaret Thatcher’s great line? Socialists eventually run out of other people’s money, and that’s exactly what Keir Starmer is proposing to do.

Mr Tugendhat told GB News: “You would not expect me to run up any white flags ever and I’m not going to do it now. This is a fight to the line, it’s a fight to the end and we’ve got a hell of a lot of campaigning to go. “We’re about halfway through the campaign, so it’s hardly surprising there’s some bumps and bruises, that’s the nature of an election for those who have been through a few before. “One of the things that I find, I’ve been meeting people here in the most beautiful constituency in the entire country in west Kent and there are a lot of people who are supportive still, a lot of people who are still very kind on the doorstep and a lot of people who are undecided. “You can understand why they’re undecided, we’ve been in for 14 years, there’s many challenges, a lot of the decisions we’ve taken in recent years still have to play out. And we’re seeing some of the advantages, if you look at Brexit... These are decisions that we have seeded already that are going to take a little while to grow fruit.”                      12 Jun 2024-03:42PM GMT                                         ‘Bad Boy of Brexit’ joins Reform                    Arron Banks, the businessman and prominent Brexit supporter, has joined the Reform party following the return of Nigel Farage as its leader. Confirming he had signed up as a member, Mr Banks wrote on X: “Sod it. I haven’t been a member of a political party since 1994! Everybody should join and give the Westminster mob a real shock.” Mr Banks backed the Tories over Labour at the 2019 general election, saying: “The choice is a Tory or some horrific Corbyn combination, votes for 16 year olds [and] EU citizens and Marxist policies.” But he has since grown critical of the Conservatives over their handling of legal and illegal migration, net zero and the so-called ‘culture wars’. Along with Mr Farage, Andy Wigmore and Richard Tice, Mr Banks was one of the ‘Bad Boys of Brexit’ who compared for Britain’s departure for the European Union with Leave.EU.                      12 Jun 2024-03:34PM GMT                                         Exclusive: Labour must drop ‘unviable’ net zero plans, warns GMB                    Labour’s net zero plans are “unviable” and must be dropped from the manifesto, the GMB union has warned. Sir Keir Starmer’s pledge to convert Britain to clean power by 2030 – five years earlier than the Conservatives – will lead to “power cuts and blackouts”, the union said.GMB, which represents more than half a million workers including many in the oil and gas sector, passed a motion at its annual congress this week in Bournemouth urging the Labour party to change course.It will be seen as a last-ditch attempt by GMB, a major Labour donor, to influence the party ahead of its manifesto launch tomorrow.The motion pointed to its attempts last year to “persuade the Labour Party to drop its commitment to net zero electricity generation by 2030 on the grounds that it was simply not viable”, adding: “The Labour Party has not walked away from this unviable commitment.” Camilla Turner, our Sunday Political Editor, has the scoop                      12 Jun 2024-03:22PM GMT                                         Sunak and Starmer arrive in advance of Sky debate                    Both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer have arrived at Grimsby Town Hall for the Sky leaders’ event this evening, Genevieve Holl-Allenwrites.

The Liberal Democrat leader plunged into a man-made lake while completing a floating agility course in Henley-in-Arden, Warwickshire, earlier today. Sir Ed arrived at the Aqua Jungle to champion his plans for a Clean Water Authority to replace Ofwat as the regulator of water companies. He donned a wetsuit, fluorescent helmet and life jacket before climbing across the obstacle course and slipping off a tight-rope and swinging platforms into the water. This is just the latest of Sir Ed’s stunts since campaigning began, including his attempt at paddleboarding on Windermere in Cumbria in May, where he fell into the water multiple times.

Ms Dorries, a former culture secretary, told Times Radio: “It’s over for the Conservative Party right now. I’m not even sure why candidates are bothering to go out and deliver leaflets, it’s over. “But what I will say is this. In 1997, there was ‘Teflon Tony’ and Tony Blair is not Keir Starmer. And I think Labour are going to come into power, if they win, if something miraculous doesn’t happen in the next few weeks, and I think they will have a very difficult five years. “That’s because politics right now is very difficult and that’s because of social media and various other factors coming into play. It’s very much about personality, as you’ve seen the campaign lit up by Nigel Farage, as you saw with Boris Johnson. There is not a lot of love out there with Keir Starmer. “A lot of people will stay at home, he will come in at default, and I think he will find it very difficult to do what Tony Blair did and have those 13 years. So there is a chance for the Conservative Party to come back.”                      12 Jun 2024-02:44PM GMT                                         ‘Rishi Sunak’s Sky TV fund’ page set up                    A JustGiving page has been set up which mocks Rishi Sunak’s comments about not having Sky TV as a child. When asked about his wealth and if he ever had to go without something he wanted, Mr Sunak told ITV’s Tonight programme: “There’ll be all sorts of things that I would’ve wanted as a kid that I couldn’t have. “Famously, Sky TV, so that was something that we never had growing up actually. But it was lots of things but again, that’s my experience.” A fundraising site, which will actually donate all proceeds to food bank charity The Trussell Trust, jokes “millions of people across the UK were heartbroken” to learn the Prime Minister had gone without satellite television in his youth. “Rishi is now facing more hardship,” it reads. He is down to just one helicopter and he could soon be out of a job. Forced to live on just a PM’s pension and quite a few tens of millions in the bank, Rishi could once again be deprived of Sky TV. So I am asking you for help.”                      12 Jun 2024-02:31PM GMT                                         ‘Labour on the side of drivers?

We all take the pledges made during an election campaign with a generous pinch of salt, and voters have long since given up on expecting every promise will be fulfilled.  But hold on. With a vow today to be on “the side of drivers,” the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is surely taking this game of deception to a whole new level.  Coming from a party where local mayors and devolved administrations have attempted to turn sitting behind a steering wheel into an almost criminal activity, the chutzpah is breathtaking. The truth is that Labour hates cars, and the people who drive them – and it would be better for us all if they simply admitted that.

Kevin Hollinrake, the postal minister, told ITV’s Tonight: “We all kind of entered Parliament in 2015 full of the joys of spring. “And I think we’ve all got a dose of political reality, which I think every politician gets when they enter the fray. “So I think he’s been probably hardened on the battlefield.”                      12 Jun 2024-02:13PM GMT                                         Labour’s advert van arrives in Grimsby                     Labour’s election advert van has arrived in Grimsby ahead of Sky’s Battle For Number 10 event tonight.

Asked on the Tory battle bus as it travelled to Lincolnshire if he had given up, the Prime Minister said: “No, absolutely not. “What you saw yesterday is we put the manifesto forward which has got a very clear set of tax cuts for the country, tax cuts at every stage of your life. “Whether you’re working, setting up a small business, tax cuts when you’re trying to buy your first home, tax cuts for pensioners, and tax cuts for families. And I’m really energised to now have a chance to put our very clear plan to the country.” Mr Shapps, the Defence Secretary, was asked this morning about Conservative Party social media adverts which suggested the Tories could be reduced to a rump of just 57 seats.  He said that Labour winning a “super majority” would be bad for democracy and put the UK in a “dangerous place”.                       12 Jun 2024-02:02PM GMT                                         Former Tory minister: We should be prepared to ‘come together’ with Farage                    A former Conservative minister has caused controversy by choosing to put a picture of herself with Nigel Farage on her election leaflet, writesWill Hazell. Dame Andrea Jenkyns, who is running for election in Leeds South West and Morley in West Yorkshire, included a picture of herself with the Reform UK leader on her campaign material. Her party leader Rishi Sunak does not appear on the leaflet and nor are the Conservatives mentioned. Defending her choice of campaign literature on X, Dame Andrea said her party should be prepared to “come together” with Reform to prevent a “socialist super-majority”: Lots of excitement over my leaflet today...

A cup and another object were thrown at the Reform UK leader while he was on top of a party battle bus in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, on Tuesday. This followed an incident last week when a milkshake was thrown over the 60-year-old as he left a Wetherspoons pub in Clacton-on-Sea in Essex. Two people have been charged over the incidents.

We are no longer going to put up with being stigmatised as “far-Right” when our young adult children can’t afford a place to live or endure finger-wagging lectures by One Nation “centrists” – aka supercilious, semi-skimmed Lib Dems who make Tony Blair look like Margaret Thatcher.The great immigration betrayal must rank as one of the most unforgivable things any political party has ever done to its supporters. It’s at the root of so many problems: housing, hospital queues, welfare benefits, crime.Having broken their promise in every Conservative manifesto since 2010 (David Cameron said numbers would come down to the “tens of thousands”), a self-soothing globalist elite set about limiting the topics it was permissible to discuss. A “bit of a dog whistle” could swiftly shut down anyone who demurred.Now that same lofty cabal informs us that it is all our fault the Tories are heading for a historic defeat. We are the stupid, short-sighted peasants who are going to usher in a Labour government because, strangely, we refuse to vote again for the party that has kicked us in the teeth – while simultaneously flooding the country with so many people we can’t find a dentist to get those teeth fixed.

The Tory manifesto promises “a year-long, full-time placement in the Armed Forces or cyber defence” as an alternative to volunteering placements for 25 days a year. But in an interview with Good Morning Britain, Mr Shapps said: “From a Defence Secretary’s point of view, the very concept of being able to introduce 30,000 people for experience... They are not going to be... This is a 25-day thing in a year, for experience in our Armed Forces.” Challenged on the pressures that military accommodation could face, he replied: “It’s not, as you presented, 30,000 people for over an entire year, it’s 25 days a year for those 30,000.” A Conservative Party source claimed Mr Shapps was talking about an initial 25-day training period for those who opt for the military service option.                      12 Jun 2024-01:27PM GMT                                         Good afternoon                                         Dominic Penna here, The Telegraph’s Political Correspondent, guiding you through the rest of the day.

It is subtle, but no less significant for that, writes Ben Riley-Smith.  So far in the race, Rishi Sunak has insisted that only the Tories can lower taxes, protect pensioners, keep the UK secure and the like. The Tories will keep arguing that Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has no plan for government, that you cannot be sure what you will get given his past record of about-turns. Something else, though, has been expressed in recent days: the idea that Labour could be heading for a huge victory and that people need to vote Tory to provide some accountability when that happens.

Helen Miller, deputy director at the think tank, said: “The Green Party has set out a vision which would see the size of the state increase on an unprecedented scale: by the end of the next parliament they want to increase taxes by over £170 billion per year to fund a £160 billion boost to day-to-day public service spending.  “They also plan to spend an additional £90 billion a year on capital spending, which would be a particularly big increase. Even taking their figures at face value, overall borrowing would end up around £80 billion a year higher and we could expect debt to be rising throughout the next Parliament.” Ms Miller also said that it was “unlikely” that the party’s proposed tax rises would generate the amount claimed and “certainly not without real economic cost”.                       12 Jun 2024-12:51PM GMT                                         Pictured: PM speaks to pupils during a science lesson at a school in Grimsby                                         12 Jun 2024-12:39PM GMT                                         Poll: Labour now level with SNP in Scotland                    The SNP and Labour are now tied in Scotland, according to a new Westminster voting intention poll published this afternoon.

All I say is, people can see there’s a very clear contrast at this election.“I’m really pleased that we’ve put together a clear plan for the country. It contains a set of bold actions and crucially, it cuts people’s taxes at every stage of their lives.”12 Jun 2024-11:24AM GMTI had a ‘very fortunate’ upbringing, admits Sunak after ITV interview backlashRishi Sunak has said he had a “very fortunate” upbringing after facing a backlash for saying he had to go without Sky TV as a child, writes Tim Sigsworth. Speaking on the Tory campaign battle bus, the Prime Minister said: “I was very, very fortunate that my parents had good jobs.“My dad was a GP and my mum was a pharmacist, and they worked really hard to support me and my brother and sister and I’m really grateful to them for that and actually more importantly than material things what they did for all of us was instill in us a sense of hard work, and service, but also just provide an enormous amount of love.“And that’s the most important thing that they did for us and I’m very grateful for that. And that’s why I’m very fortunate that the reality of the situation is my grandparents emigrated in this country with very little and in three generations, I’m sitting here talking to you as prime minister.“And I think that says an enormous amount about our country because I don’t think my story would be possible pretty much anywhere else in the world.”12 Jun 2024-11:15AM GMTStarmer reveals first car as Labour pledge help for motoristsSir Keir Starmer has revealed what he had as his first car, as he set out plans for Labour to fix up to a million potholes a year if they enter government, writes Genevieve Holl-Allen. The Labour leader’s first car was a Morris Minor, for which he paid £125, adding that it “fell apart pretty quickly”.He added: “The second one was the Morris Minor, it was one of those ones with an extension on the back, those wooden ones which was called ‘the hedge’ because it was so dilapidated. Moss was growing out of it, that sort of thing. But I was very fond of that car until it too fell apart.”He described his first car as his “first and proudest purchase” and that driving was in his “blood”.12 Jun 2024-11:07AM GMTTory voices calling for more radical action ‘cherrypicked’, says PMRishi Sunak dismissed the suggestion that his manifesto should have been more radical.Asked about the lukewarm reaction from some quarters, the Prime Minister said: “I think you’ve cherrypicked one or two.

Asked on the Tory battle bus which is travelling to Lincolnshire if he had given up, the Prime Minister said: “No, absolutely not.“What you saw yesterday is we put the manifesto forward which has got a very clear set of tax cuts for the country, tax cuts at every stage of your life.“Whether you’re working, setting up a small business, tax cuts when you’re trying to buy your first home, tax cuts for pensioners, and tax cuts for families.“And I’m really energised to now have a chance to put our very clear plan to the country.”12 Jun 2024-11:01AM GMTMain parties ‘running away’ from climate promises, claim GreensOther parties are “running away” from their climate promises, Adrian Ramsay, co-leader of the Green Party has said.Mr Ramsay told the Party’s manifesto launch: “If you look at the other parties, the climate crisis has been pretty much absent from this election campaign so far.“The other parties are running away from their promises on climate.

An ambitious but realistic plan for the future that we can be proud of.”12 Jun 2024-10:51AM GMTNigel Farage: Election ‘is over’ and Labour will win ‘big majority’Nigel Farage claimed the general election is already over and Labour is going to win a “big majority”. The Reform UK leader said he believed he was best placed to lead the opposition to a Labour government in the House of Commons. He said in a campaign update video posted on Twitter: “This election is over. Labour are going to win. They are going to have a big majority. “But who is the voice of opposition going to be because after all we need proper opposition for our democracy to function. “Rishi says don’t give Labour a blank cheque by voting for Reform and Grant Shapps has been out on the media repeating that line. “Do you know what? The real blank cheque to Labour would be if the Conservatives were still in opposition.” Mr Farage said a defeated Conservative Party would be too busy fighting and arguing “amongst themselves” to scrutinise a Labour government and a Reform-led opposition would provide a “clean start”. 12 Jun 2024-10:40AM GMTTories are ‘loathed’ by many of their 2019 backers, claims FarageNigel Farage claimed the Tories do not realise how “loathed” they are by many of the people who voted for the Conservative Party at the 2019 general election. The Reform UK leader said: “I don’t think this Conservative Party quite understand how loathed they are by about 50 per cent of the people that voted for them in 2019.” He pointed to the Tories’ failure to deliver on an old pledge to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands and said: “It is called betrayal. That is literally what it is.”12 Jun 2024-10:31AM GMTFarage: Reform membership up by 50 per centNigel Farage said Reform UK’s membership has grown by 50 per cent since he announced his return to front-line politics last week.

Asked whether this was the case, he told reporters in Grimsby: “No. we know that we have to earn every vote. Not a single vote has been cast and I know that every day we have to make a positive case for change. “We will show in our manifesto that we have a plan for the country to renew, to rebuild, setting out the six steps that we will do on day one with our sleeves rolled up, but we need a mandate for that and we need to have the backing of the country for the change that I think the country needs. “So I say what I said at the beginning of this campaign, if you do want change you have to vote for change.”                      12 Jun 2024-09:53AM GMT                                         Starmer wants ‘mandate to change the country’ on July 4                    Sir Keir Starmer said he is seeking a “mandate to change the country” at the general election on July 4.  Speaking to broadcasters in Grimsby this morning, the Labour leader said: “We will set out our manifesto tomorrow. It will be a positive case in detail about the future of our country, how we renew and how we rebuild.  “I am not complacent about this. I know that every single vote has to be earned. Nobody has cast a vote in this election yet.  “But it is important, I think, for the country that we have change and I think for change we need a mandate so that we can go forward, turn our back now on the chaos, the division and the failure of the last 14 years and start to rebuild our country with the first steps that we will start on on day one.  “So I am seeking to earn those votes and I say to every voter, if you want change you have to vote for change, we need a mandate to change the country and take our country forward.”                      12 Jun 2024-09:46AM GMT                                         Tories: Labour choosing eco drive over motorists                    The Tories claimed Labour was continuing to “sacrifice motorists for their eco zealot agenda” as they responded to the opposition’s pledge to fix one million extra potholes a year (see the post below at 08.54).  A Conservative Party spokesman said: “We will take no lectures on backing drivers from the party that has declared war on motorists across Britain. “Blanket 20mph roads, ULEZ expansions, banning new roads, road charging, or failing to back fuel duty freezes-all clear examples that Labour continues to sacrifice motorists for their eco zealot agenda. “Only the Conservatives have a clear plan and are taking bold action to back Britons on the road.

Rachel Reeves refused to deny her party could change the levy in its first Budget to spend more on public services. Labour has ruled out any rises in income tax and National Insurance if it wins the election on July 4. But at a press conference yesterday, Ms Reeves repeatedly failed to make the same commitment about capital gains tax, only saying she had “no plans” to increase the charge.

The Chancellor won his seat of South West Surrey in 2019 with a majority of almost 9,000, with the Liberal Democrats in second place.  But that seat was abolished under the boundary review and Mr Hunt is now standing in the newly created constituency of Godalming and Ash.  He told Bloomberg: “There’s all to play for. This seat is probably going to be won or lost by the Conservatives by 1,500 votes or fewer.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:37AM GMT                                         Tory ‘tax scare tactics won’t work’, says Lord Kinnock                    The Conservative Party’s “tax scare tactics won’t work”, a former leader of the Labour Party said.  The Toiries have claimed that Labour would put taxes up by more than £2,000. Labour has rejected the claim.  Lord Kinnock said the Tories having presided over tax rises in recent years meant such attacks would not land.  He told Bloomberg: “Now is different: We’re operating against the background of scores of Tory tax rises. Their reputation as a tax-cutting party is in shreds.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:18AM GMT                                         Lord Kinnock: Starmer needs ‘room to manoeuvre’ on tax rises                    Lord Kinnock, the former leader of the Labour Party, suggested Sir Keir Starmer would be wise not to box himself in by ruling out too many tax rises.  Labour has ruled out increasing income tax, VAT, National Insurance and corporation tax.  But the party has refused to rule out making changes to other levies like capital gains tax.  Lord Kinnock told Bloomberg that “every government needs room to manoeuvre” so it can respond to events.  He said: “Five years is a very long time in fiscal regime: Neither voters nor politicians can escape that reality.”                      12 Jun 2024-08:14AM GMT                                         Shapps stumbles on Tory stamp duty pledge                    Grant Shapps gave the wrong figure for the Conservative Party’s new stamp duty policy during an interview on LBC this morning.  The Defence Secretary told presenter Nick Ferrari that stamp duty would be abolished for first-time buyers on homes valued up to £450,000. Later in the show Mr Ferrari put it to Mr Shapps that the policy is actually set at £425,000. Mr Shapps said: “You’ve got a number in front of you, you’re probably right, because I was thinking off the top of my head.” Mr Ferrari said: “So you’re the Secretary of State for Defence, sent out today to talk, and you don’t get the number right…” The Cabinet minister replied: “If it’s written down as 425 it’s 425. Off the top of my head I remember it as 450. I found it here… you’re right, it’s 425 million…” Mr Ferrari interrupted: “I think it’s £425,000.” Mr Shapps said: “Sorry, indeed.” 'It's £425,000, not £425 million.'Grant Shapps fumbles the numbers on stamp duty in his interview with @NickFerrariLBC.  pic.twitter.com/2GKTEiHlJE                      12 Jun 2024-08:06AM GMT                                         ‘More to do’ to improve UK economy, say Tories                    The Tories said there is “more to do” to improve the UK economy as they responded to this morning’s GDP data from the Office for National Statistics (see the post below at 07.04).  A Conservative Party spokesman said: “Today’s figures show our economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the three months to April. “There is more to do, but the economy is turning a corner and inflation is back down to normal. This election is a choice. Under the Conservatives, we can keep the economy growing with our clear plan to cut taxes on work, homes and pensions, or we can risk all that progress with Labour’s £2,094 of tax rises on every working family.” Labour has rejected the Conservatives’ £2,000 tax claim.                       12 Jun 2024-07:54AM GMT                                         Labour promises to fix one million extra potholes a year                    A Labour government would fix one million extra potholes a year, Sir Keir Starmer has pledged. The opposition leader said the number of road craters in need of repair across the country was a “plague” as he promised to tackle the issue if elected on July 4. Contractors filled in just over two million potholes last year but the RAC estimates there are still around a million potholes at any given time as British roads continue to crumble.

The Labour leader said he had supported an ongoing freeze to fuel duty but he would not give a firm commitment to maintaining it if he wins power.  Speaking to The Sun newspaper, Sir Keir said: “What I am not going to do is write future Budgets.  “The campaign The Sun runs comes up Budget by Budget and it has to be decided Budget by Budget but our track record on this is pretty consistent with The Sun’s campaign.

The Labour leader told The Sun: “I do still drive because I love driving, I have always loved driving, and that is something that has been throughout.  “The first car we ever got as a family was a Ford Cortina. My dad loved driving, I loved this car. You can imagine the scene when I was about four or five years old, I was outside cleaning the car the whole time. “He loved driving, I love driving, I still do drive because I love it, a little bit, not as much as I like to.”                       12 Jun 2024-07:10AM GMT                                         Shapps denies Sunak ‘completely tone deaf’ on D-Day                    Grant Shapps denied Rishi Sunak was “completely tone deaf” on D-Day after it emerged the Prime Minister said he was late for a TV interview because commemorations had “ran over”.  The Prime Minister left commemorations in Normandy in order to return to the UK and conduct a general election interview with ITV.  A clip of the PM arriving at the interview  showed that Mr Sunak apologised to the presenter for being late as he said the “incredible” commemorations “all just ran over”. It was suggested to Mr Shapps this morning during an interview on Sky News that the clip showed Mr Sunak was “completely tone deaf”.  But the Defence Secretary said: “No. First of all, I was at the D-Day events and he was there meeting British veterans.

I think the more interesting thing is what does he really think about our veterans? What is his actual belief in this.  “And he is a Prime Minister who has from day one of his administration had a veterans’ minister in his own Cabinet. I don’t recall a time when we have had a veterans’ minister sit in the Cabinet in order to promote all the interests of veterans.”  Mr Shapps said Mr Sunak had done a “huge amount for veterans”.                       12 Jun 2024-07:07AM GMT                                         Defence Secretary: Tax burden will be lower by 2030 under Tories                    The overall tax burden will be lower by 2030 than it is now if the Tories are re-elected, Grant Shapps said this morning.  The Defence Secretary told Sky News: “The year that we target is the last year of the Parliament, so 2030, and in that time we would see a reduction in the overall tax burden, not least because we have already, as people know from their own pay packets have cut a third off of National Insurance.”                       12 Jun 2024-06:48AM GMT                                         Cutting welfare bill by £12bn will not be ‘particularly difficult’, says Shapps                    Grant Shapps said it will not be “particularly difficult” for the Tories to shave £12 billion off of the nation’s welfare bill in order to pay for tax cuts. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said yesterday that it had a “degree of scepticism” that the cost saving plan would deliver the savings the Tories anticipated.  But Mr Shapps, the Defence Secretary, told Sky News this morning: “On the welfare side, I don’t think that will be particularly difficult. It is important to know that the welfare budget has ballooned post-Covid by I think about £34 billion and we are suggesting £12 billion of that will be reduced.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:30AM GMT                                         Defence Secretary: ‘Massive majority’ for Labour would put UK in ‘dangerous place’                    Labour winning a “massive majority” would put the country in a “dangerous place”, Grant Shapps warned this morning.  The Defence Secretary said there is still “everything to fight for” ahead of July 4 but warned against handing Sir Keir Starmer a bigger majority than Sir Tony Blair secured in 1997.  Mr Shapps told Times Radio: “It is a fact of course that if you ended up with a party with massive majority, unchecked power, able to do anything they wanted, and with the instincts of, we would argue, with Keir Starmer’s party on all sorts of things from raising people’s tax to their lack of support for increased defence spending, we think that would be a dangerous place to put this country. “But no one has cast a vote… there is everything to fight for and we are fighting for every single seat in this country.  “The polls have been wrong before. But I think it is perfectly legitimate to say the country doesn’t function well when you get majorities the size of Blair’s or even bigger and we would say there are a lot of very good, hard working MPs who can hold the government of the day to account and we’d say those are Conservative MPs.”                       12 Jun 2024-06:25AM GMT                                         Shapps warns voters not to hand Labour ‘super majority’                    Grant Shapps has warned voters not to hand Labour a “super majority” at the general election, arguing it would be unwise to give Sir Keir Starmer “unchecked” power.  The Defence Secretary was asked about Conservative Party social media adverts which suggested the Tories could be reduced to a rump of just 57 seats.  He told Times Radio: “I think the simple point is that if you want to make sure that in this next government, whoever forms it, that there is a proper system of accountability, then we would argue that you don’t want to have somebody receive a super majority and in this case of course the concern would be that if Keir Starmer were to go into No 10, it will either be Rishi Sunak or Keir Starmer. “There is no other outcome to this election, and that power was in some way unchecked it would be very bad news for people in this country.  “A blank cheque approach, allowing someone to do anything they wanted, particularly when their particular set of plans are so vague.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:22AM GMT                                         Tories have ‘utterly failed’ to deliver economic growth, claim Lib Dems                    The Liberal Democrats claimed the Tories had “utterly failed” to deliver economic growth as the party responded to today’s GDP figures (see the post below at 07.04).  Sarah Olney, the party’s Treasury spokesperson, said: “As Rishi Sunak’s time as Prime Minister peters out, so does the UK’s economic growth. “The Conservatives have utterly failed to deliver the growth they repeatedly promised, instead presiding over stagnation and economic misery for hardworking families across the country. “The Conservatives’ manifesto shows they simply lack the ambition and vision to get the economy moving again. It’s clear for voters across the country that the only way to make it happen is to vote them out of office on 4 July.”                      12 Jun 2024-06:10AM GMT                                         Rachel Reeves: UK economy has ‘stalled’                    Rachel Reeves said the UK economy had “stalled” and no growth in April (see the post below at 07.04) exposed the “damage done after 14 years of Conservative chaos”.  The shadow chancellor said: “Rishi Sunak claims we have turned a corner, but the economy has stalled and there is no growth.  “These figures expose the damage done after 14 years of Conservative chaos. We are now in the third week of this general election campaign and in that time the Labour Party has set out its plan to grow the economy by bringing back stability, unlocking private sector investment and reforming our planning system.  “All the Conservatives are offering is more of the same, with a desperate wish list of unfunded spending promises that will mean £4,800 more on people’s mortgages. Rishi Sunak’s plan is a recipe for five more years of Tory chaos. “It’s time for change. The election on 4 July is a chance to vote Labour so we can end the chaos, turn the page and rebuild our economy.” Rishi Sunak claims we have turned a corner, but the economy has stalled and there is no growth. The Conservatives have failed.It's time for change.                      12 Jun 2024-06:04AM GMT                                         UK economy did not grow in April                    The UK economy recorded no growth in April, according to data published by the Office for National Statistics this morning.  That followed growth of 0.4 per cent in March.                       12 Jun 2024-05:58AM GMT                                         Sunak is late to ITV interview and blames it on D-Day event that ‘ran over’                    Rishi Sunak was late for the television interview he left the D-Day commemorations for – and blamed it on the Normandy event which he said had “ran over”. The Prime Minister cut away from last week’s event with world leaders that marked the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings at Normandy so he could record an interview with ITV as part of the general election campaign. Mr Sunak has apologised for missing the remainder of the commemorations and on Monday asked D-Day veterans to “find it in their hearts” to forgive him. At the start of the interview for ITV’s Tonight programme, Mr Sunak apologised to presenter Paul Brand for being late, saying the “incredible” commemorations in Normandy “all just ran over”.

Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will square off in their second election showdown tonight in Grimsby, hosted by Sky News. The battle will have an interesting dynamic as it straddles the two manifesto releases, with the Tories’ plans ripe for interrogation while Labour’s remain under wraps until tomorrow. Mr Sunak will kick off the day campaigning in North East Lincolnshire, while Sir Keir and Louise Haigh, his shadow transport secretary, are in Humberside to set out Labour’s pitch to motorists. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, is heading to Warwickshire and later Surrey to talk about the party’s plans for a Clean Water Authority. It’s manifesto launch day for the Green Party, who will be making their pitch to the nation in Hove. Co-leaders Adrian Ramsay and Carla Denyer will be joined by deputy leader Zack Polanski and parliamentary candidates including Sian Berry. North of the border, Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, will outline his party’s vision for the NHS in Edinburgh, where SNP leader John Swinney is also out campaigning with candidate Joanna Cherry. Then it’s all eyes on Sky News this evening, where Mr Sunak and Sir Keir take to the stage for their second big televised event. The format will be different from ITV’s, with 20-minute sit down interviews followed by 25-minutes of questions from the audience.                      12 Jun 2024-05:42AM GMT                                         ‘Not the time to be critical,’ says Rees-Mogg after Tory manifesto launch                    Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was “not the time to critical” as he responded to yesterday’s launch of the Tory manifesto.  The former Cabinet minister said he believed many of the pledges made by Rishi Sunak were “really important”.  Asked for his reaction to the manifesto, Sir Jacob told GB News: “It is not the time to be critical. I am a Conservative candidate in a general election, I am supporting what the Conservative Party is setting out and what Rishi Sunak is setting out.  “And what he has set out is very clear. It is a policy of ensuring that taxes do begin to come down after a period of consolidation, that migration is reduced, both legal and illegal, and that policies are implemented that will help people set up businesses, will reduce the National Insurance on the self-employed, will encourage enterprise.  “This is, I think, really important.”                       12 Jun 2024-05:40AM GMT                                         Rees-Mogg: Tories need ‘coalition’ with Reform                    Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said the Tories needed to form a campaign “coalition” with Reform UK because the Conservative vote is split.  A YouGov survey published yesterday put the Tories just one point ahead of Reform, 18 per cent to 17 per cent.  Sir Jacob, the former business secretary, told GB News: “If the Conservatives and Reform are very close, what does that tell you about dividing the Tory family?  “If you divide the Tory family you make it worse for both parts, the in-laws and the outlaws, so to speak, and that what we need is a coalition, a coalescence, of the various parts of the Tory party family.” Load-Date: June 12, 2024  End of Document
