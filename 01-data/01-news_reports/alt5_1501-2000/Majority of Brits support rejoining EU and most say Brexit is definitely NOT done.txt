Polling by YouGov reveals that while "Bregret" is very high there is not an immediate appetite amongst people in the UK to reverse the decision. Just 26% say there should referendum on the matter before the end of 2023, with 59% saying there shouldn't be.  The key takeaways from the polling are:                                             Just 26% say there should referendum on rejoining the EU before the end of 2023                       46% support revisiting the question within the next 10 years                       30% of Britons say Brexit is done, although 49% still say it is not                       Were a referendum to be held now, 50% of Britons say they would vote to join the European Union                       Among 18-24-year-olds an overwhelming majority 70% would vote to join the European Union                                                               Read more: Latest Wales poll shows how people rate Mark Drakeford compared to other Welsh leaders and Rishi Sunak When asked if there should be a referendum in the next five years, 39% agreed there should be, but 44% thought not.

Unsurprisingly, it is Remain voters who are most in favour of a new EU referendum, with 41% saying there should be one this year, 61% saying so within the next five years, and 70% in the next ten years. By contrast, only 8% of Leave voters support a referendum in 2023, 16% think there should be one in the next five years, and 20% within the next ten years. While Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has ruled out rejoining the EU, most of those who currently intend to vote Labour say there should be another referendum in the next five years 63% or ten years 69%. Few current Tory voters agree, at 13% and 21%, respectively. Were a referendum to be held, figures suggest the 'Re-join' side would likely win, with 50% of Britons saying they would vote to join the European Union, compared to just 30% saying they'd vote to stay out. This is heavily driven by those who currently intend to vote Labour and 2016 Remain voters, with 78% and 82% respectively saying they'd vote to re-join, compared to just 20% of current Conservative voters and 15% of Leave voters.                      Have we got Brexit 'done' yet                    While many regret and even want to overturn Brexit, do they think Brexit is 'done' in the first place There has been a rise in the number of Britons seeing Brexit as 'done', but overall, they still think there is more 'Brexit-ing' to do. In February of this year, only 18% of people thought Brexit was 'done', with 60% saying it was not. Now, this has risen to 30% saying Brexit is complete, although 49% still say it is not. Most Remain voters say Brexit is not yet done, at 59% versus 22%. Leave voters are split, with 40% seeing our exit from the EU as done and dusted, compared to 45% who say it is not yet complete. YouGov's tracker data shows that dissatisfaction with the government's handling of Brexit continues to be very high, with 72% saying they are doing badly. Six in ten 62% believe Brexit has been more of a failure than a success, and a majority 55% say we were wrong to vote to leave in the first place. Beth Mann, political researcher at YouGov, said: "Despite high levels of Bregret among the British public, this new polling shows that there is not necessarily a widespread appetite for another referendum anytime soon. However, there are strong party divisions that could swing campaigns as we head into the next election and beyond, with a significant majority of those who currently intend to vote Labour backing a referendum on re-joining the EU within next 5 or 10 years.  "Our figures also suggest that if a referendum were to be held now, Briton re-joining the EU would come out on top. So, while political leaders have time on their side, this polling suggests that there will likely come a point in the coming years when conversations about another referendum will be hard to avoid."
