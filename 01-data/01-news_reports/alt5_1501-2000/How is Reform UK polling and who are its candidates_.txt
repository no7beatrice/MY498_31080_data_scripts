   How is Reform UK polling and who are its candidates? thetimes.co.uk March 12, 2024 Tuesday 7:45 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 1274 words Byline: Aubrey Allegretti, George Willoughby Highlight: Reform has overtaken the Liberal Democrats to become Britain’s third highest-polling party ahead of the general election, and has even overtaken the Conservatives in one poll Body   Nigel Farage  has positioned Reform UK as the “real opposition to Labour” after his party overtook the Conservatives in one poll.  Farage promised to lead a “political revolt” as he announced his return to frontline politics as the leader of Reform UK. His party has been consistently polling ahead of the Liberal Democrats and intends to field candidates in almost every constituency at the election. So who are they, who’s funding them and what do its candidates stand for? Reform UK manifesto: the key policies Could Reform UK overtake the Tories? Unlike in 2019 when the  Brexit Party , the precursor to Reform UK, stood aside in seats held by Conservatives, Farage’s party will go up against Tories this time round. According to the polling expert  Sir John Curtice , most of Reform’s support comes from voters who backed Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party in 2019. He says  Farage’s sudden return  makes it more likely the party will “perform creditably”. It was Reform’s decision to fight so many constituencies that partly led YouGov to predict the  Conservatives would win only 140 seats  on July 5. Reform  insiders said the party had gained much-needed momentum with the defection of Lee Anderson from the Conservatives in March and now the return of Farage as leader. How is Reform UK polling? Reform has overtaken the Conservatives in a poll for the first time. A  YouGov survey for The Times  found that support for Reform had increased by two points to 19 per cent while the Tories were unchanged on 18 per cent.  It will particularly concern Tory strategists as it was carried out after the party released its manifesto. After the poll was released, Farage declared: “We are now the real opposition to Labour.” However, The Times’  poll of polls  puts Reform in third place, ahead of the Liberal Democrats, at 17 per cent compared with the Conservatives’ 20 per cent.  With  Lee Anderson  becoming its first MP in parliament, Reform sources suggested other Tories could follow suit and defect. However, the party has struggled to prove it has a concentrated enough base to win any seats through the ballot box. “We could get six million votes at the next general election and not win a single MP,” one senior Reform figure admitted.                    John Curtice:                    Reform will dent Tory vote — but writing was already on the wall The party is aiming to draw level with the Conservative Party, which has struggled to turn around its significant polling deficit.  Recent polls  have even suggested the Tories are losing momentum — dropping to the low twenties. On the day of Anderson’s defection, Reform had 1,000 members sign up. Reform has made little secret of its ambitions to target the Tories, but has also previously said it wants to  take on “Starmergeddon” under Labour .  “Some Tories say we’re letting Keir [Starmer] into Downing Street via the back door by standing against the Tories,” one Reform source said. “But it’s the Tories who’ve left the front door open. This is on them.” Who are Reform’s key candidates? The return of  Nigel Farage  means one of the most significant figures in modern British history is back in frontline politics. After quitting as leader in 2021, he focused on his television show on GB News, appeared in ITV’s                     I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here!                     and spent a lot of time in the US, campaigning for the Republican candidate  Donald Trump . Most famously, he was for a long time a member of the European parliament and the leader of Ukip, very publicly opposed to increased integration for Britain within the European Union. His campaigning for Brexit was seen as one of the drivers behind Britain’s decision to leave the EU in 2016. The previous frontman was  Richard Tice  — an Isle of Wight-based property millionaire who served as leader from March 2021 until June 3 this year. Tice was previously an MEP for the Brexit Party, Reform’s previous incarnation. Tice failed to win a London Assembly seat in 2021, with just 3 per cent of the vote. He came third in the  Old Bexley & Sidcup by-election  that same year with 6.6 per cent and previously stood in Hartlepool at the 2019 general election — albeit with a more impressive 25 per cent of the vote and only a thousand votes behind the Conservatives. General election key dates — from TV debates to manifestos Tice made more of a name for himself in the political arena during the Brexit campaign, by co-founding the pressure group Leave Means Leave. Another key figure in Reform is Ben Habib, the party’s co-deputy leader. He is also a former Brexit Party MEP. Habib was the Reform candidate in the  Wellingborough by-election  in February, triggered by the  ousting of the Tory MP Peter Bone  over harassment claims, which he denied. Taking 13 per cent of the vote in the by-election, the result showed that Reform could achieve the level of votes that until then it had been polling theoretically. Habib was one of those who appeared more sceptical about Anderson’s defection. “I’m very circumspect about all Tory MPs — particularly Tory MPs who can’t express themselves clearly,” Habib told GB News. “I picked [Anderson] up on it when he described  Sadiq Khan  as being controlled by Islamists. Clearly Sadiq Khan is not controlled by Islamists.” Anderson  is emblematic of the type of voter Reform wants to speak to: disaffected so-called “red wallers” with a working-class background. He is the MP for Ashfield but has defected from parties before, having left Labour and joined the Tories in 2018. He prides himself on being controversial and outspoken. However, his comments about Khan, the mayor of London, saw him lose the Conservative Party whip. Anderson has also called for the return of the death penalty, told asylum seekers who did not like the Bibby Stockholm barge to “f*** off back to France” and accused people who used food banks of being unable to budget. What are Reform’s policies? The Brexit Party was a single-issue party, so since the change in name in November 2020 Reform has been broadening its policies. Migration is a big focus for the party. It wants to freeze all “non-essential” migration, with the Home Office abolished and replaced by a new Department for Immigration. Reform also wants Britain to leave the European Convention on Human Rights, due to frustrations with the attempts some migrants who arrive on small boats in the Channel make to thwart their deportation. Energy and net zero is another major area of focus. Farage has referred to net zero as “net stupid” and wants to  accelerate the granting of oil and gas licences  in the North Sea. Reform has said all existing carbon emissions targets should be abandoned due to what it says is an unfair burden being placed on taxpayers and consumers. On the economy, Reform said it would reduce the main corporation tax rate from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.  It also advocates business rates being scrapped for small and medium-sized businesses, with an online delivery tax of 3 per cent created to ensure a “fairer playing field” for high street retailers. Who funds Reform? Reform is still being run on a shoestring. Insiders admit its organisers are “semi-amateurs operating from the pub” but stress they are “deadly serious”. In 2023 Reform recorded £255,000 in donations. Some £200,000 came from First Corporate Consultants Ltd, a company owned by the climate change sceptic Terence Mordaunt, who previously donated to the Tories. The party also accepted £10,000 from the financier  Crispin Odey  in August 2023, two months after misconduct allegations against him emerged. Jeremy Hosking, another businessman and previous Tory donor, gave Reform £15,000 last May. Load-Date: June 24, 2024  End of Document
