   7 years ago UK voted to leave EU: Why Brexit happened The Times of India (TOI) June 24, 2023 Saturday  Copyright 2023 Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd. All Rights Reserved Section: UK Length: 774 words Body   Brexit, short for "British exit," refers to the process by which the United Kingdom (UK) withdrew from the European Union (EU). The Brexit process began with a referendum held on June 23, 2016, in which UK citizens voted on whether to remain in or leave the EU. The "Leave" campaign won by a narrow margin, with 51.9% in favor of leaving.After the referendum, the UK government triggered Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union on March 29, 2017. This officially initiated the withdrawal process and set a two-year timeframe for negotiations with the EU.Why led to BrexitSeveral factors contributed to the decision for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, leading to Brexit. Here are some key factors:Sovereignty and Control: One of the main arguments put forth by Brexit supporters was the desire to regain national sovereignty and control over decision-making. Critics felt that EU membership limited the UK's ability to make independent decisions on issues such as immigration, trade, and regulations.Immigration and Free Movement: Concerns over immigration played a significant role in the Brexit debate.  The principle of free movement within the EU allowed citizens from member states to live and work in any other member state. This led to increased immigration to the UK, which some saw as putting pressure on public services and job markets.Euroscepticism and Popular Discontent: The UK has had a history of euroscepticism, with a portion of the population expressing dissatisfaction with EU membership. This sentiment was fueled by issues such as perceived bureaucratic interference, a lack of democratic accountability, and disagreements over EU policies and regulations.Economic Concerns: Economic factors also played a role in the Brexit decision. Some argued that EU membership imposed costs on the UK, such as contributions to the EU budget, and that leaving the EU would allow the UK to have more control over trade agreements and regulations, potentially benefiting the economy.Political and Identity Factors: The Brexit referendum reflected divisions within the UK's political landscape. The Conservative Party, in particular, faced internal disagreements on the EU, and the referendum was seen as a means to settle these divisions. Additionally, for some, the issue of national identity and a desire to assert British independence played a significant role in supporting Brexit.Globalization and Global Political Shifts: The Brexit referendum occurred in the context of wider global political shifts, with populist movements gaining momentum in various parts of the world. Some viewed Brexit as a rejection of globalization and a desire to assert national sovereignty and control in an increasingly interconnected world.UK's journey post BrexitHere is an overview of the UK's journey after Brexit:Changes in Immigration: The UK introduced a new points-based immigration system, ending the free movement of people between the UK and the EU. EU citizens seeking to live and work in the UK are now subject to similar immigration rules as non-EU citizens.Economic Impact: Brexit has had economic implications for the UK. There have been disruptions to trade, particularly at the borders, as new customs and regulatory checks were introduced. Some sectors, such as fisheries and agriculture, have faced specific challenges.Financial Services: The UK's financial services sector, previously benefiting from EU passporting rights, lost access to the EU single market. The UK and the EU are working on establishing a framework for financial services cooperation.Northern Ireland Protocol: To prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (an EU member), the Northern Ireland Protocol was implemented. It effectively keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, leading to some trade disruptions and political tensions.Bilateral Agreements: The UK has been actively pursuing bilateral trade agreements with countries around the world. It has signed deals with several countries, including Japan, Canada, and Australia, among others.COVID-19 Pandemic: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the UK, as it has for countries worldwide. Brexit coincided with the challenges posed by the pandemic, affecting the economy, healthcare system, and overall governance.Scottish Independence: Brexit reignited discussions about Scottish independence. Scotland, which voted against leaving the EU, has seen increased calls for another independence referendum to separate from the UK and rejoin the EU as an independent nation.
