   Tories exploit Starmer's EU slip - but at their own risk i-news September 23, 2023 First Edition  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

The arch- Remainer has told hacks ahead of his party's conference in Bournemouth that voters "aren't talking about Europe", confirming that the Liberal Democrats - who campaigned on stopping Brexit in 2019 - would not campaign to rejoin the European Union. To be fair to Davey, his party's stop Brexit pitch in the last election led to the party performing below expectations and even the then leader - Jo Swinson (inset) - losing her seat. Labour, too, had a dismal time - as confusion over the policy under Jeremy Corbyn gave the Tories the opportunity to pitch themselves as the party that would "get Brexit done". It was this pledge along with public scepticism of Corbyn and Boris Johnson pitching himself as a different type of Tory that led to the party winning a majority of 80. It follows that even without the turmoil of the past two years, the Conservatives would have faced a struggle holding on to the coalition of voters. It's why one of the more safe predictions of the next election appeared to be that there would be no repeat fight on Brexit. They were too battle-scarred. But that is now changing. Unfortunately for Davey and anyone who thought the EU battles were so 2017, Brexit is coming back for the next election. When Keir Starmer took over as Labour leader following the party's historic defeat, he said relatively little on the issue. He began his leadership of the Labour party keen not to spend much time talking about it - as he tried to shake off his Remain credentials (Starmer campaigned for a second referendum under Corbyn) out of concern that they could prove toxic to the "Red Wall" voters the party needs to win back to win power. Even his Europhile Shadow Cabinet ministers such as the shadow Foreign Secretary, David Lammy, and the shadow Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, toed the line. But in recent weeks there has been a subtle shift from the Labour leadership. Officially, Labour's position remains that it would not rejoin the customs union, single market or bring back freedom of movement. But Starmer's recent European charm offensive - visiting Emmanuel Macron in Paris this week - means that he is now pushing this to the limits. Starmer has spoken about a returns deal with the EU in order to tackle small boats. Just this week, the Labour leader told the Financial Times that a Labour government would seek a much better Brexit trade deal with Brussels when the deal comes up for review in 2025. He then told a conference of centre-left leaders in Canada that "actually we don't want to diverge". The comments have been seized on by critics. Starmer's decision to talk more about a closer relationship with the EU has surprised the Tories - who see an opportunity. They would like nothing more than to see Starmer spend an election campaign getting tangled up in old debates about Brexit. "It bodes well for a general election," says a government figure. As Labour talks more about closer relations, the Tories are wondering whether reliving Brexit wars could turn the mood to their advantage. Ultimately, few believe the next election will be decided on the issue of which EU rules the UK aligns or diverges on. But by getting on to this terrain, the hope is that Starmer looking shifty on any aspect of policy on Europe could sow seeds of doubt in the aspects of Brexit that voters feel most strongly about - such as freedom of movement. "It's just another contribution to the overall narrative of moving us back to Europe," says one Tory. Inside Labour, some aides worry that Reeves and Starmer speaking more positively on the EU could encourage shadow cabinet colleagues to do the same. "If we end up in a situation where every shadow cabinet minister is quizzed on the EU it will be a minefield," says one adviser - they argue that the fact many of the Shadow Cabinet backed a second referendum means that the interviews could serve to remind the public of their prior behaviour. However, as ever, the aspect that is working in Labour's favour is the Tory record. A YouGov poll earlier this year found only 9 per cent of Britons now consider Brexit more of a success than a failure. Even ministers will privately admit that they are short on Brexit bonuses to point to. "It's been a disappointment," says a former Cabinet minister. "We should be doing more with Brexit opportunities." Even Brexit trade deals are seen as tricky to turn into vote winners. Under Johnson, the Vote Leave team tried to stop Liz Truss talking about a US trade deal for fear it would lead to voters growing concerned about chlorinated chicken. It means that while the Tories are looking at Starmer getting dragged back into the EU's orbit with glee, it will only work if they have a positive story of their own on the UK's exit from the EU.
