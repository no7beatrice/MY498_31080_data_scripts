   Brexit has NOT damaged UK trade with EU - report Scottish Daily Mail November 6, 2023 Monday Edition 1, Scotland  Copyright 2023 Associated Newpapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 16 Length: 229 words Byline: Leah Montebello Body   BREXIT has not damaged the UK's trade with the European Union despite dire warnings from Remainers, a report argues today. Exports of goods and services have continued to rise since Britain left the EU, according to analysis by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) think-tank. Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch will today argue that this growth contradicts the 'narrative that Brexit has severely damaged our economy'. She is expected to say that the figures show Britain should 'stop talking ourselves down, and instead talk ourselves up'. After the Brexit vote in 2016, many gloomy economists and Remainers suggested the move would harm UK businesses by making trade harder with companies on the Continent. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Government's fiscal watchdog, predicted in 2021 new barriers linked to Brexit would result in a 15 per cent drop in trade volumes. It argued that this lower trade would be driven by stunted investment in Britain due to the uncertainty caused by Brexit. But the IEA has argued the outlook is much www.brighter.UK goods exports jumped by 13.5 per cent to EU countries and 14.3 per cent to non- EU countries between 2019 and 2022, according to Office for National Statistics figures. This makes claims Brexit has harmed UK trade with the EU look 'absurd', economist Catherine McBride, author of the IEA report, argued. Comment - Page 18 Load-Date: November 6, 2023  End of Document
