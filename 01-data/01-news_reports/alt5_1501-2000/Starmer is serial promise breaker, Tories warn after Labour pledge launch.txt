   Starmer is serial promise breaker, Tories warn after Labour pledge launch telegraph.co.uk May 16, 2024 Thursday 4:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 7341 words Byline: By Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor Body   The Tories labelled Sir Keir Starmer a “serial promise breaker” as they responded to the Labour leader setting out six of his main general election pledges.  Sir Keir used a campaign rally in Essex this morning to unveil a new version of Labour’s traditional pledge card.  The card spells out what a Labour government’s priorities would be in half a dozen policy areas, with promises including 40,000 extra NHS appointments a week and 6,500 new teachers in key subjects.  Sir Keir said the pledges would form part of a Labour government’s efforts to put the UK “back in the service of working people”.  But Richard Holden, the chairman of the Conservative Party, said: “Today’s speech was devoid of any plan for Britain. Sir Keir Starmer is a serial promise breaker who doesn’t have the courage or conviction to stick to a single pledge he has ever made – just look at his last pledge card, which he abandoned the second he got the chance.  “His unfunded spending, higher taxes and amnesty for illegal migrants would take Britain back to square one. “Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives are sticking with the plan to build a brighter future for British families, with inflation down from 11.1 per cent to 3.2 per cent, the economy growing and £900 back in hard-working people’s pockets – as well as a fair immigration system with boat crossings down.”                      You can follow the latest updates below and join the conversation in the comments section                      here                      .                                          16 May 2024-03:00PM GMT                                         That is all for today...

The former prime minister had previously expressed frustration with the ECHR and in 2016 suggested the UK should leave the treaty as it could “bind the hands of Parliament”. But asked today whether she still thought the UK should look to leave or reform the ECHR, Mrs May said she now thought Britain should remain in the convention. She told a press gallery lunch in Westminster: “That’s partly because circumstances have changed, also because sadly we have shown as a country a willingness to row back sometimes on certain aspects of international law. “I think we should stay in something that we helped to create in the first place.”                      16 May 2024-02:37PM GMT                                         I’ll stay on as an MP if Tories lose election, says Sunak                    Rishi Sunak said he would stay on as an MP even if the Conservatives lose the general election. The Prime Minister said he would “of course” continue to represent Richmond, his North Yorkshire constituency, regardless of whether he remained in Downing Street. There had been speculation that he could pursue a job in venture capital or artificial intelligence, possibly in California, were he to leave politics.

Angela Constance, the Scottish Justice Secretary, said she would table proposals to free some inmates serving sentences of less than four years. Those imprisoned for sexual crimes and domestic abuse would be excluded.

The former Ukip leader, now the honorary president of Reform, said he believed Rishi Sunak would fail to win over the public regardless of any pact because of voters’ anger over the Tories’ record on immigration. His comments were made to Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg after the senior Tory had urged Mr Sunak to strike a general election pact with Reform on the basis, claiming a united Right would put victory “within reach”.

The Commons Leader referenced the song “Nowhere Man” from the band’s 1965 album Rubber Soul as she argued Sir Keir’s pledges were hollow.  Ms Mordaunt told MPs that she believed voters “are not going to fall for today’s pledge card”. She said: “There’s nothing there. There’s no vision, no plan, no principles on which to steer by, which is why this pledge card will go the way of all the others. “With apologies to The Beatles, this Leader of the Opposition is a nowhere man, sitting in his nowhere land, making all his nowhere plans for nobody. “He doesn’t have a point of view, he’s no good for me or you, and judging by this latest pledge card he is nowhere near good enough for Britain.”                      16 May 2024-01:36PM GMT                                         Lord Frost accuses Labour of ‘fantasy politics’ on net zero pledge                    Lord Frost accused Labour and net zero advocates of “indulging in fantasy politics” as he rubbished the Opposition’s goal of decarbonising the UK’s energy sector by 2030.  The former Brexit Secretary suggested that renewable energy was not as cheap as the Government was banking on.  Speaking in the House of Lords today, Lord Frost said: “It’s better to be honest, and that pushing out these fantasy figures just makes it easier for the proponents of net zero and the party opposite to indulge in fantasy politics that the whole energy sector can be decarbonised in just six years’ time.” Lord Callanan, an energy minister, agreed that Labour’s decarbonising plan was “fantasy politics”, with the Conservatives having pledged to hit the goal by 2035.                      16 May 2024-01:24PM GMT                                         Lord Cameron’s former Bullingdon Club friend endorses Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer has been endorsed by an old Etonian who was a member of the Bullingdon Club alongside Lord Cameron and Boris Johnson. Sebastian James, managing director of Boots UK, was unveiled by Labour as one of the latest business figures to back the party during a rally event on Thursday. Mr James, son of hereditary peer the 5th Baron Northbourne, appeared in a video message to endorse Rachel Reeves’ plan for the economy. The Boots boss was once a member of the Bullingdon Club, the private all-male dining club for Oxford University students, alongside the Foreign Secretary and Mr Johnson.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which oversees MPs’ expenses, said the MP for Blackpool North had also under-reported use of his constituency office for party political activity. Ipsa said it would be “appropriate” for the MP to repay £1,257 for the rent and maintenance of a printer which he used to produce the material. It said he had agreed to pay back an additional £110 “in recognition of the possibility of inaccurately logged usage of the constituency office for party-political activity”.                      16 May 2024-01:01PM GMT                                         Sue Gray says devolved nations should have more power in Westminster                    The devolved nations should be given more power at Westminster, Sue Gray has said. Sir Keir Starmer’s chief of staff told the Covid Inquiry in Northern Ireland today that Stormont, Holyrood and the Senedd should be handed more of a say in central Government decision-making. “I think there would be real benefit in Northern Ireland, and in fact the other devolved governments in Scotland and Wales, being involved in discussions that take place in Westminster from a very early stage,” she told the Covid Inquiry.

The Labour leader set out six “first steps” which he would take in power, all of which have been enshrined on the party’s new campaign pledge card. Telegraph readers have been delivering their verdict on the pledges in the comments section of today’s live blog:                       16 May 2024-12:04PM GMT                                         Impact of being PM on my family ‘weighs on me’, says Sunak                    Rishi Sunak said being Prime Minister meant he was not able to be “as good” a dad or husband as he would like to be.  He said the impact of the job on his family “weighs on me”.  Asked if it played on his mind, Mr Sunak said: “Yes. I was very fortunate, I was raised in a very loving, tight-knit family, I think family is really important, probably the most important thing in all of our lives and not being able to be as good a dad, as good a husband as I would ordinarily like to be, of course it weighs on me.”                       16 May 2024-11:52AM GMT                                         Sunak insists he will stay on as MP even if Tories lose election                    Rishi Sunak said he will stay on as an MP even if the Conservative Party loses the next general election.  He told ITV’s Loose Women programme: “Yes of course I am staying. I love being an MP, I love my constituents, I love my home in North Yorkshire, it is wonderful and I love being able to get back there.”                      16 May 2024-11:49AM GMT                                         Sunak asked: ‘Why do you hate pensioners?’                    Rishi Sunak was asked why he “hated pensioners” as he was grilled on ITV’s Loose Women programme.  It was suggested to the Prime Minister that there is an argument that pensioners “come out worse under the Tories” and that a spring Budget cut to National Insurance had not helped the elderly.  Mr Sunak said he cared “deeply about pensioners” and stressed the importance of people having dignity in retirement.                       16 May 2024-11:44AM GMT                                         Sunak urges voters to ‘judge me by my actions’                    Rishi Sunak was told during his appearance on ITV’s Loose Women that “people are suffering right now” as he was pressed on what the Government is doing to alleviate poverty.  The Prime Minister said that financial security was probably the “most acute concern that people have” and the nation had been through a “really tough time”.  He said the benefits system is working and benefits have been uprated.  Mr Sunak was then asked how he could connect with ordinary people if his lived experience was completely different to theirs. He pointed to the coronavirus pandemic and his decision to introduce the furlough scheme.  He urged the nation to “judge me by my actions”.                      16 May 2024-11:38AM GMT                                         New sex education guidance will mean children are only taught the facts, says Sunak                    Rishi Sunak said the Government’s new guidance on sex education in schools is based on making sure things are taught in an “age appropriate way”.  The Prime Minister said that “everyone will do this in their own way” in terms of parents informing their own children.  Appearing on ITV’s Loose Women programme, he said he wanted to “support parents through that” and he believed most parents wanted to know what their children were taught on the subject in schools.  He said he wanted to make sure that sex education in schools was focused on teaching “kids the facts”.                       16 May 2024-11:33AM GMT                                         Sunak faces ‘intimidating’ grilling on ITV’s Loose Women                    Rishi Sunak is appearing on ITV’s Loose Women programme this lunchtime.  The Prime Minister joked that appearing on the show was on the “more intimidating end” of the things he has had to do since becoming premier.                       16 May 2024-11:32AM GMT                                         Pictured: Reeves and Rayner pose with Labour’s new pledge card                                         16 May 2024-11:27AM GMT                                         SNP: Labour ‘wedded to same reckless policies as Tories’                    The SNP claimed Labour was “wedded to the same reckless policies as the Tories” as the party responded to Sir Keir Starmer’s campaign rally.  Mhairi Black, the SP’s Westminster depute leader, said: “Sir Keir Starmer’s speech was full of broken promises and empty slogans-demonstrating why voting SNP is the only way to stand up for Scotland, protect our NHS, and advance our journey towards independence. “On the biggest issues damaging the UK, from austerity cuts to Brexit, the Labour Party is wedded to the same reckless policies as the Tories. “You can’t stabilise the economy if you are trashing it with Brexit, and you can’t deliver strong public services if you are imposing billions of pounds of cuts to our NHS, schools and police. “The problem for Sir Keir is that he has U-turned on nearly every policy he has ever promised-so it’s little wonder the public don’t trust a single promise he now makes.”                      16 May 2024-11:07AM GMT                                         Tories label Starmer a ‘serial promise breaker’                    The Tories labelled Sir Keir Starmer a “serial promise breaker” as they responded to the Labour leader’s campaign rally.

He was asked if the public could expect to see Labour deliver on the six “first steps” he set out today within two terms of a Labour government.  He replied: “Yes, is the answer… and that is why we are doing so much thinking now about what we need to do to deliver on these missions.”                      16 May 2024-10:39AM GMT                                         Sir Keir Starmer insists he is no ‘copycat’ of Sir Tony Blair                    Asked what he would say to critics who may label him as a “copycat Blair”, Sir Keir Starmer said: “The first thing I would say about Tony Blair which is more important than whether he took his tie off is he won three elections in a row.  “And what Blair did in 97 is what Wilson did in 64 and Attlee did in 45 which was to take the Labour Party from opposition into power. “And the thing that unites them was the ability to glimpse the future and to persuade people to go on that journey to a changed future.”  He added: “In that way there are similarities because I do think you have got to glimpse the future, you have got to understand the challenges... but it is not copycat because we are now what 27 years on from 1997. The challenges we face now are not the same as those faced by Tony Blair.”                       16 May 2024-10:33AM GMT                                         Labour’s small boats plan will be ‘massive deterrent’, insists Starmer                    The Labour leader was asked how he intended to disincentivise illegal migrants from making the journey to the UK.  Sir Keir Starmer insisted that the “biggest disincentive to people coming here is that they won’t be able to get in boats across the Channel”.  He also said that “smashing the gangs” would be a “massive deterrent”.                       16 May 2024-10:28AM GMT                                         Starmer rejects suggestion Labour pledges are similar to Tories                    Sir Keir Starmer rejected the suggestion that some of his pledges were the same as Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party.  He said: “Let me reject the idea that this is similar [to the Tories]. The Government says they are going to stop the boats.  “More people have come by boat this year, 8,000 than any other year. That is a record failure.”                       16 May 2024-10:23AM GMT                                         Labour facing ‘very different moment to 1997’, says Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer claimed the Tories had “beaten the hope” out of people during their 14 years in power.  The Labour leader said: “This is going to take time, rebuilding that hope and that trust. This is a very different moment to 1997 after the damage that has been done in the last 14 years.” Sir Keir denied that he had a poverty of ambition and insisted Labour was promising voters “big, bold change”.                       16 May 2024-10:19AM GMT                                         Starmer denies ‘scaling back’ ambitions for Labour government                    It was suggested to Sir Keir Starmer as he answered questions from the press after his speech in Essex that he was “scaling back” his ambitions for the Labour government.  The Labour leader categorically rejected the suggestion.  He said: “I am not. I am not scaling back our ambition absolutely at all.”                       16 May 2024-10:16AM GMT                                         Starmer can’t say when Labour would deliver 40,000 extra NHS appointments pledge                    Sir Keir Starmer was unable to say when a Labour government would deliver on a pledge to create 40,000 extra NHS appointments every week.  He was asked how many weeks into a Labour government it would be before the pledge was delivered.  He replied: “We will get to it just as quickly as we can, as swiftly as we can. The ambition is there.” He added: “Our ambition is to get that up as quickly as possible. I am not going to put a number on it.”                      16 May 2024-10:12AM GMT                                         ‘Decline is not inevitable,’ says Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer said that Labour’s message was that “decline is not inevitable”.  Concluding his remarks at a campaign rally in Essex, Sir Keir said: “Decline is not inevitable, politics can make a difference, Britain will have a better future and you can choose it with Labour.  “Stop the chaos, with Labour, turn the page, with Labour, return politics to service, with Labour.  “And with patience, with determination, with these first steps we can rebuild our country, with Labour.”                       16 May 2024-10:06AM GMT                                         Tories left UK ‘exposed’ on higher energy bills, claims Starmer                    The Labour leader claimed the Conservative Party’s approach to energy had left UK households “exposed” to higher bills.  He said the UK was “more exposed than other countries” when there are global energy shocks and he was “not prepared to let that happen under a Labour government”.  He said Labour’s plan to set up the Great British Energy company would help to “keep bills down for good”.                       16 May 2024-10:04AM GMT                                         Sunak has not learnt the lessons from Truss mini-Budget, claims Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer said that if you “lose control of the economy it is working people who pay the price”.  The Labour leader claimed that “Rishi Sunak has not learnt the lessons” from Liz Truss’s mini-Budget as he referred to the Tories’ ambition to eventually scrap National Insurance.                       16 May 2024-09:56AM GMT                                         Sticking plasters are easy but they don’t work, says Labour leader                    Sir Keir Starmer said there had been a “loss of trust, of hope, of confidence even in our ability to take our country forward” among voters. He said a Labour government would “rebuild that hope, that trust and that confidence”.  “You cannot do that with gimmicks, with short term decisions,” he said.  Sir Keir told activists that “sticking plasters are easy” but such an approach “just doesn’t work”.                      16 May 2024-09:52AM GMT                                         Starmer: ‘No quick fix to the mess the Tories have made’                    Sir Keir Starmer said that “there is no quick fix to the mess the Tories have made of this country”.  The Labour leader told a campaign rally in Essex: “We have all had enough, the whole country has had enough of 14 years of failure, spinning round and round and round going in circles.”                      16 May 2024-09:50AM GMT                                         Labour will put UK back in the service of working people, says Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer is now on his feet at Labour’s campaign rally in Essex.  The Labour leader, with his sleeves rolled up and an open collar, said he had changed the party and “put it back in the service of working people”.  He said: “And what we seek, humbly, is the opportunity to change our country and put it back in the service of working people.”                       16 May 2024-09:44AM GMT                                         Young people ‘neglected’ under Tories, claims Phillipson                    Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, claimed that young people’s futures are being “neglected” after 14 years of the Conservative Party being in power.  She said that “schools are literally crumbling around the next generation”.  Ms Phillipson said it will be up to a Labour government to “turn the tide” and improve the nation’s education system. Labour’s first step on education would be to introduce 6,500 new teachers in key subjects, she said.                       16 May 2024-09:39AM GMT                                         Analysis: Labour frame Net Zero drive through lens of reducing household bills                    Listen carefully to what Labour is talking about on energy and it tells you how they see the politics of the climate crisis, writes Ben Riley-Smith. Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow energy security secretary, endlessly focussed on two implications of the party’s policy agenda in his speech just now.  They were lower prices and increased security. And not, for example, the importance of improving the environment.  It suggests that Labour strategists are alive to the criticism that the push for Net Zero and its financial implications could turn off voters.  So they are getting out early making the counter-argument: own the clean energy revolution and it will reduce prices.                       16 May 2024-09:37AM GMT                                         Confidence in police has ‘plummeted’ under Tories, claims Cooper                    Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, is now on stage at Labour’s campaign rally in Essex.  Ms Cooper told Labour activists that after 14 years of the Tories being in power “90 per cent of crimes go unsolved” and that “more criminals are let off and more victims are let down”.  She said that public confidence in the justice system and the police had “plummeted”.  Labour would put 13,000 more neighbourhood and PCSOs back on the beat, she said.                      16 May 2024-09:34AM GMT                                         Election will be ‘most consequential in history’ for climate change, says Miliband                    Ed Miliband said a Labour government would make the UK “energy independent”  The shadow climate change and net zero secretary said one of the first steps of a Labour government would be to set up a new clean energy company called “Great British Energy”.  He said the company would be owned “by and for our citizens”.  Mr Miliband argued the forthcoming general election will be the “most consequential energy and climate election in our history”.                       16 May 2024-09:29AM GMT                                         Boots managing director appears to endorse Labour                    Seb James, the managing director of Boots UK, appeared to endorse Labour’s plan for the economy.  A video message from Mr James was played at the Labour campaign rally in Essex.  He said: “Some of the things that I think are incredibly important to a business like boots, for me, first and foremost, it is stability.  “A stable economy provides the right platform for sustainable economic growth and it is that real focus on economic growth that is going to be so important in the next few years.” CEO of Boots Seb James endorses Labour and Starmer pic.twitter.com/601eXbedij                      16 May 2024-09:23AM GMT                                         Streeting claims Sunak has ‘given up on the NHS’                    Wes Streeting said that the Tories have “driven our NHS into the ground over the last 14 years” and that the “basic promise that the NHS will be there for us when we need it has been broken”.  The shadow health secretary said: “Rishi Sunak has given up on the NHS, more interested in scapegoats than solutions so it is clear the longer the Conservatives are in power, the longer patients will wait.” Mr Streeting said it would be up to a Labour government to “rescue and renew” the NHS. He said Labour would deliver 40,000 more appointments each week to tackle waiting lists.                       16 May 2024-09:18AM GMT                                         Rachel Reeves: Labour is ready to rebuild Britain                    Rachel Reeves said she would never play “fast and loose” with the public finances and her first goal if she becomes chancellor would be to deliver “economic stability”.  “After the last 14 years, stability is change,” the shadow chancellor said.  Ms Reeves said that “Labour is ready to serve, ready to lead and ready to rebuild Britain”.                       16 May 2024-09:11AM GMT                                         UK worse off after 14 years of Tories in power, claims Reeves                    Next up at the Labour campaign rally in Essex is Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor.  Ms Reeves said that “we have changed the Labour Party so that we might have the chance to change our country”.  Ms Reeves said she has “huge ambition for Britain” and that she sees “potential wherever I go”.  But the UK has been left “worse off” after 14 years of the Conservative Party being in power.                      16 May 2024-09:09AM GMT                                         Rayner: Labour has a plan to ‘get Britain back on its feet’                    Angela Rayner told a campaign rally in Essex that the Tories had “abused” the trust of voters “but Labour will never take you for granted”.  The Labour deputy leader said her party had a “plan to get Britain back on its feet”.                       16 May 2024-09:07AM GMT                                         Labour under ‘no illusions about the scale of the climb ahead’, says Rayner                    Labour’s campaign rally in Essex is now underway.  Angela Rayner, the Labour deputy leader, has started the proceedings.  She said that Labour will “deliver where the Tories have failed” and that there will be a “long journey to national renewal”.  Ms Rayner said Labour was under “no illusions about the scale of the climb ahead” and the party will “rebuild Britain in lockstep with you”.                       16 May 2024-09:04AM GMT                                         Labour goes big budget for campaign rally                    Labour has gone big budget for the launch event of its new six-point pledge card, writes Ben Riley-Smith.  Journalists, staffers and candidates have gathered in a vast indoor space in Essex.  A lot of work for has gone into the event, with aides telling The Telegraph they have been planning it for months and likened prep to the party conferences.  Sir Keir Starmer will speak in ‘the round’, with the audience on all four sides of him. A bunch of shadow cabinet ministers are also expected to speak.                       16 May 2024-08:40AM GMT                                         Starmer promises low taxes from Labour on Blair-style election pledge card                    Sir Keir Starmer will promise to keep taxes “as low as possible” as he unveils the policies at the centre of his election campaign with a Tony Blair-style pledge card. But the Labour leader will not announce any specific tax cuts, and the ambition will be placed alongside his other economic ambitions, raising the prospect that taxes could rise if he is elected. In total six pledges are to be announced at the launch at a campaign rally in Essex this morning, one of the swing areas where Labour hopes to make gains at the election.

The Education Secretary said in April  this year that she would no longer use the phrase “trans women are women”, explaining that her understanding of the issue has “evolved”. She sought to clarify her position this morning as she was grilled on the subject during an interview on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.  Ms Keegan said that she had “always known that trans women aren’t women” but sought to draw a distinction between gender reassignment and self-identification.  She said there is a “huge difference between self-identification, people who want to identify but still have a male body, biologically are male, and then there are a very, very small number of people… who do have and have had gender reassignment and reassignment surgery”.  Asked if she would say that people who have gone through gender reassignment are women, she said: “Well, this is what we should say. I personally believe if you have gone to that level of, you have got the gender recognition, you have got the reassignment, then you are legally and medically allowed to say that you are a woman.”                      16 May 2024-08:34AM GMT                                         Keegan unsure how widespread teaching of ‘inappropriate’ content is in classrooms                    Gillian Keegan said she does not know how widespread the teaching of “inappropriate” material about gender identity is in schools. Asked to give an example of inappropriate content being taught in classrooms, the Education Secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I’ve seen some materials where they talk about gender identity being a spectrum, there being many different genders looking at you know, trying to get children (to) do quizzes on you know, what’s a different gender identity and what isn’t. “Ignoring biological sex in the material I saw anyway… and a lot of that material has caused concern.” Asked how widespread the issue is, she said: “I don’t think it’s widespread, I mean, I don’t know because you know, it’s not something that we’ve gone and done a particular survey of.” When it was put to her that it was “staggering” she did not know how widespread the issue is despite having created “silence around these issues”, Ms Keegan said “it’s guidance that was introduced in 2019. The review was done in 2021… this very new guidance has been put in and embedded”.                      16 May 2024-08:00AM GMT                                         Labour election chief tells supporters: We have to attract Tories to win                    Labour’s general election chief said the party will have to persuade Tory voters to switch sides if it is to win power.  Pat McFadden said Labour will not win the next election “just by appealing to the people who always voted Labour”.  He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “When someone crosses the floor as has happened a number of times over the years in politics, I think what it says about the party is that it has changed and that there are perhaps people looking at it today in a different light.  “And I have an obvious message for listeners and for anyone thinking of voting at the next election. We will not win the next election just by appealing to the people who always voted Labour.  “The only way you are going to win the next election is by appealing to people who haven’t traditionally voted for you and who voted Conservative in many cases in recent elections.  “That is what the difference between losing and winning is and there is nothing to be ashamed of in that.”                      16 May 2024-07:53AM GMT                                         Education Secretary: ‘Most teachers’ doing ‘brilliant job’ on sex education                    Gillian Keegan said teachers can talk with children aged eight about conception, birth and how babies are made.  Asked what the correct answer would be if a young pupil asks questions about conception, the Education Secretary told BBC Breakfast: “You talk about conception, talk about birth, you talk generally about how babies are made. “I mean, I’m not a teacher but teachers are very used to doing that. That’s not where it gets controversial, to be honest. You can talk about that in a very factual, scientific way.” She said “most teachers” are doing a “brilliant job” at educating children so that they are “prepared and fully equipped for life”.                      16 May 2024-07:37AM GMT                                         Keegan: Belief of ‘different genders on different days’ has been taught in schools                    Gillian Keegan said she has seen evidence that children are being taught in school about “choosing lots of different genders” and that gender is “fluid”. Asked to give an example of non-anecdotal evidence she has seen of inappropriate material being taught in classrooms, the Education Secretary told BBC Breakfast: “It was actually more of a request as a result of that review to provide more clarity.” Asked to give a specific example, Ms Keegan said: “There have been materials which I’ve seen… things like choosing lots of different genders and identities, and saying which ones of these are gender identities, gender spectrum, it can be a spectrum, it’s fluid, you can have different genders on different days.” Asked whether there is evidence of this having been taught in classrooms, she said: “We’ve received evidence with those slides to say that they’ve been taught in classrooms.”                      16 May 2024-07:27AM GMT                                         Some gender ideologies are ‘madness’, says Gillian Keegan                    Gillian Keegan said some gender ideologies are “madness” and they should not be taught in schools.  Ms Keegan will today publish  long-awaited relationships, sex and health education guidance which states that sex education should not be taught before the age of nine. The Education Secretary told Sky News: “You can explore ideologies, you can have different sorts of contested debates, view A, view B, debate them, etc. “But you can’t say that this is something that people believe and people believe as a fact when it’s not.” Ms Keegan said there had been “some evidence from some people” that pupils were being taught that there could be “72 genders” and gender could “change daily” as facts. She said: “Contested views about there could be 72 genders, no, we don’t want our children to be taught things that are very much contested and most of us, when you look at those kind of materials find it, sort of, they’re just madness really. There’s all kinds of strange ideologies in this area and we do not want those being taught in schools, no.”                       16 May 2024-07:19AM GMT                                         Tories and Reform agree more than they disagree, says Rees-Mogg                    Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said there is “far more on which” the Tories and Reform agree than disagree.  The senior Tory MP told GB News: “And although there are some matters between Reform and the Conservatives on which we disagree, not many actually, all political parties are coalitions and there’s far more on which we do agree, including, I would hope, a desire to keep the socialists out of power. “A Labour government would do the opposite of what the electorate wants. Its popularity in the polls is a sign of a desire for change, not support for its policies. Sir Jacob said the answer to how best to stop Labour winning the next election is to “reunite the Tory family”.  “All of the problems we see in modern Britain; mass migration, small boats, public sector wokery, ESG, economic stagnation, statism, the list goes on, would be increased by socialism and this needs to be stopped,” he said.  “So the answer is for Conservatives and Reform to reunite the Tory family.”                      16 May 2024-07:12AM GMT                                         Rees-Mogg: Failure to do Tory-Reform pact could ‘hand victory to Labour on a plate’                    Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg has doubled down on his call for the Tories to do a general election deal with Reform, arguing it would provide the “clearest roadmap to an electoral victory for toryism”.  The former business secretary said there was significant policy overlap between the two parties and they should be “working together”. Failing to do so could “hand a victory to Labour on a plate”, he said.  He told GB News: “The Reform UK electoral contract is fundamentally conservative. It appeals to Conservative voters and members and there is an overlap which suggests we ought to working together. “Top of Reform’s priorities, cutting government waste, slashing net migration, stopping the boats and boosting the economy. These are all policies that belong in the Conservative Party. “If the parties remain separate, this could hand a victory to Labour on a plate.”                      16 May 2024-06:55AM GMT                                         Tory MPs ignored me at Conservative Party conference, says Farage                    Nigel Farage said many Tory MPs “turned their heads to the side” and ignored him when he attended the Conservative Party’s annual conference last year.  Mr Farage told Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg on GB News: “I came to your conference and I was mobbed by conservative activists, donors and members.  “But most of your colleagues walked past me and turned their heads to the side.”                      16 May 2024-06:49AM GMT                                         We’re miles away from a radical Tory party I’d join, says Farage                    Nigel Farage said the Conservatives are currently “miles away” from being a party he would be willing to join.  Mr Farage, the honorary president of Reform, said the Tories would need to shift to a “radical new form of conservatism”.  Asked what it would take for him to join the Tories, Mr Farage told Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg on GB News: “A Tory party. Not the old school Tory party but the radical new form of conservatism that embraces people from all classes and actually gives the people of this country half a chance and is unashamed about putting the British people before international agreements. “I think we’re miles away from that at this moment in time.”                      16 May 2024-06:43AM GMT                                         Farage: Tories would not win election even with Reform pact                    Nigel Farage suggested the Conservative Party would still not win the next general election even if it had a pact with Reform because of voter anger over the Tories’ handling of immigration.  Mr Farage, the honorary president of Reform, said he believed the Tories “underestimate the level of contempt” among voters for them on the issue.  He told GB News: “The [immigration] numbers are stunning. And I think that Brexit voters, and particularly the Ukip-type Brexit voters, who for the first time in their lives voted Conservative in 2019, they feel an absolute sense of betrayal.  “That’s the first problem that makes any pact of any kind unlikely to win. If it was possible, it might mitigate the level of disaster.” He made the comments to Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg after the senior Tory urged Rishi Sunak to do a deal with Reform to boost the Conservatives’ hopes of victory at the next national contest.  Richard Tice, the Reform leader, has ruled out doing any deals with the Tories and Mr Sunak has done similar, arguing that a vote for Reform is a vote to put Sir Keir Starmer in No 10.
