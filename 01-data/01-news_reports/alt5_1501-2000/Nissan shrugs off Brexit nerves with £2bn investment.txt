   Nissan shrugs off Brexit nerves with £2bn investment City A.M. November 27, 2023 Monday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 City A.M. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 7 Length: 240 words Byline: GUY TAYLOR Body   TOP EXECUTIVES at Nissan have played down the impact of Brexit on its operations here after backing Britain with a £2bn investment to produce electric vehicles in Sunderland. In an interview with The Sunday Times, chief executive Makoto Uchida said that while leaving the European Union (EU) had been a challenge, the UK would remain Nissan's primary European focus for "the foreseeable future." Uchida added he was baffled at how the British talk the country down. "I am quite surprised that people here in the UK are asking, 'Why UK?' "We have great people and great talent here," he added. Following the announcement of the investment, Alan Johnson, Nissan's senior vice-president of manufacturing and supply chain, said that while Brexit had made operations in Britain "more bureaucratic" he said the firm has "quite quickly adapted", adding it is "just normal now." Johnson described the impact of post-Brexit red tape on UK prices as "negligible" arguing that volatile energy prices, for example, has had a "much more significant" impact on prices. It marks a significant shift in sentiment from the Japanese carmaker, which has questioned its commitment to Britain in a post-Brexit world. In 2022, the company announced plans to close one of the plants at its vast Sunderland site, which was responsible for producing cylinder heads for Renault. Nissan will use the £2bn to build three electric car models, including its Qashqai and Juke models. Graphic    Makoto Uchida, chief executive of Nissan Load-Date: November 27, 2023  End of Document
