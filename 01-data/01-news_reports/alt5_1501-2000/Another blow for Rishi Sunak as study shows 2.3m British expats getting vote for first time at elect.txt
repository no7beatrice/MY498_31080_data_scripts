   Another blow for Rishi Sunak as study shows 2.3m British expats getting vote for first time at election 'plan to punish the Tories for Brexit' MailOnline January 29, 2024 Monday 10:11 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 608 words Byline: Greg Heffer, Political Correspondent For Mailonline Body                        Rishi Sunak has been dealt a fresh blow after experts predicted he'll fail to win the support of an extra 2.3million British expats getting a vote for the first time this year. Earlier this month, new rules came into effect that gave British citizens living abroad the right to 'votes for life'. This abolished a previous rule that someone could only register to vote at general elections for 15 years after they left the UK. But, despite the policy being pushed by the Conservatives, it is expected the rule change will instead boost the number of votes for both Labour and the Liberal Democrats. This is due, in part, to British expats punishing the Tories for the UK's depature from the EU. Many UK citizens living in Europe are set to vote against the Conservatives as they are 'still living in the consequences of Brexit', one academic said. At the 2019 general election, the Tories' manifesto promised to 'make it easier for British expats to vote in Parliamentary elections and get rid of the arbitrary 15-year limit on their voting rights'. From 16 January this year, the rules on eligibility to register as an overseas voter changed - a move that had been opposed by Labour. It means, ahead of the next general election expected this year, any British citizen living abroad can register to vote as an overseas voter if they have either previously been registered, or were previously resident in the UK before moving abroad. Overseas voters must apply to register in the local authority of the last address they were registered to vote or were resident. The Government has estimated that 2.3million British citizens living abroad will be newly enfranchised and able to participate in the general election. Dr Susan Collard, from the University of Sussex, told The Times there was no evidence to suggest that voting intention among Britain's expat community had changed since she carried out a 2020 study into the potential impact of the rule changes. The study found the Tories' share of overseas votes fell by two-thirds between general elections in 2015 and 2019. The combined vote share for Labour and the Liberal Democrats rose from 56 per cent in 2015 to 85 per cent in 2019, it also showed. Dr Collard said evidence suggested the voting intention of British expats living outside the EU was not 'dissimilar' to those living in Europe. She told the newspaper: 'Given the unpopularity of the Conservative Party in this country, I can't see anything that they've done that would change the negative outlook for them based on the results of the data that we had.' Dr Pollard added that the main driver of the vote had been Brexit, adding: 'They're not forgetting. Many are still living in the consequences of Brexit so all I could say is there isn't any evidence that the mood has changed among those voters.' She also dismissed a view that British exparts are more likely to vote Tory as 'a stereotype that belongs to the 1980s'. 'The whole question of mobility in the EU has meant that going to live abroad is no longer posh people going to live in villas on the Mediterranean - it's a hugely diverse population, they have hugely diverse views,' she continued. Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said: 'Whatever benefit the Conservatives might have gained in the past from enfranchisement of overseas British citizens - and, in truth, no one can be sure how far that has been the case - there must be question marks about how much support the party can now hope to garner from expatriates living in the European Union, many of whom could well feel that their lives have been made more difficult by Brexit.'
