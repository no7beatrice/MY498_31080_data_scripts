On January 31, two agreements with Uruguay and Andorra will in fact come into force. "Although the UK is no longer a member of the EU, London is and always will be a European city," Khan told The Observer weekly in an interview. "I want to make it clear that I am ready to support a mobility deal that would benefit us economically, culturally and socially." "Hard Brexit has particularly damaged the employment rights of young people," Khan stressed. "The government's decision to exit the Erasmus program has also made it more difficult to study abroad." Khan, who faces ultra-conservative Susan Hall in local elections in May, is set to make Brexit his hobbyhorse, in contrast to the caution shown by Labour leader Keir Starmer. An estimated 1.2 million Europeans will be able to vote in the London polls, where anti-Brexit sentiment has been growing in recent years. The London mayor thus echoes the proposal launched seven months ago by Conservative and Brexiteer George Eustice, who called on Sunak to open bilateral negotiations with EU countries to grant two-year work visas to those under 35. Eustice warned that this measure would be a way of "post-Brexit reconciliation" with European neighbors. "The UK recognizes the importance of cultural and educational exchanges with other countries with which to support opportunities for young people," British government sources said. "We are exploring further reciprocal bilateral youth mobility arrangements (YMS) with international partners, including European partners." The Home Office has meanwhile announced a relaxation of post-Brexit rules, allowing those who mistakenly applied to renew their residence cards to remain in the country, instead of applying for "settled" status (to which one is entitled for having resided five years or more in the UK). The review of the rules also affects the 142,000 EU citizens who made a late application and are awaiting resolution of their cases. The Home Department has confirmed that it will not block applications claiming "lack of knowledge", as had been the case since last summer. Dozens of cases of European immigrants threatened with deportation or expelled upon arrival in the country have been revealed in recent months by The Guardian newspaper and have raised pressure on the Home Department. A total of 17,000 EU citizens were "turned away" in 2022 (755 of them Spanish). Despite the recent problems, the British government stresses that the post-Brexit program has been "a great success", with 7.6 million applications received, 7.4 million concluded and 5.7 million EU citizens with recognized "settled" status (383,000 Spaniards).
