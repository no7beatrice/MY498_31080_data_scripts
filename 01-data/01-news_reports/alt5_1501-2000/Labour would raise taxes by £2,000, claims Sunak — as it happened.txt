   Labour would raise taxes by £2,000, claims Sunak — as it happened thetimes.co.uk June 4, 2024 Tuesday 6:45 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 10865 words Byline: George Sandeman, Laurence Sleator, Chris Smyth, Max Kendix, Ed Halford, Seren Hughes, Matt Dathan, Fintan Hogan Highlight: Sir Keir Starmer attacked the Tory leader as the ‘most liberal prime minister we have ever had on immigration’ in the first of the TV debates Body   Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak have royally clashed in the first televised leaders’ debate of the general election. The prime minister accused Labour of planning a £2,000 tax rise, using disputed analysis from Treasury officials of the party’s spending plans, while Starmer attacked Sunak as the “most liberal prime minister we have ever had on immigration”. The public thought the prime minister performed better than the Labour leader overall, but they were more impressed by Starmer on the cost of living, NHS and education, according to YouGov polling. Sunak won it on tax and immigration, they said. The public thought Keir Starmer performed best on the cost of living, NHS, education and climate change, while Rishi Sunak was best on tax and immigration, according to YouGov polling (Seren Hughes writes). ITV leaders debate viewers were asked who they thought performed best on each topic. The Labour leader had a clear lead on cost of living (51 per cent), the NHS (61 per cent), education (52 per cent) and climate change (48 per cent). The prime minister’s only considerable lead was on tax, at 53 per cent. On immigration, the leaders were close with Sunak just winning at 45 per cent and Sunak on 42 per cent. Keir Starmer “rose above” the “tetchy” Rishi Sunak during the debate, Wes Streeting has said (Max Kendix writes). The health secretary said Sunak “showed no humility or remorse” over the cost of living crisis. Streeting said: “I just don’t think Rishi Sunak is able to connect with people. We saw really moving stories about the impacts of the cost of living crisis. He just lacks emotional intelligence.” Leaders debate viewers thought Rishi Sunak came across as more prime ministerial than Sir Keir Starmer, but they found the Labour leader more trustworthy, likeable and in touch with ordinary people (Seren Hughes writes). YouGov polling found 43 per cent of people thought Sunak came across more prime ministerial, while 40 per cent said Starmer did. Starmer led on the other attributes: 49 per cent found him more trustworthy, 50 per cent found him more likeable and 66 per cent thought he was more in touch with ordinary people. However, the public mostly found it “frustrating”. Asked which words they would use to describe the debate, 62 per cent chose “frustrating”. A third found the debate “vague”, while 42 per cent thought the debate was “interesting” and 28 per cent said it was “engaging”. Only 17 per cent said the debate was “helpful” and a mere four per cent found it “authentic”. Labour’s campaign co-ordinator has insisted that Keir Starmer dealt effectively with Rishi Sunak’s attack on taxes (Max Kendix writes). The prime minister accused Labour of planning a £2,000 tax rise, using disputed analysis from Treasury officials of the party’s spending plans. Pat McFadden said: “He said it was garbage. He talked about the Tories desperate unfunded spending commitments. The former permanent secretary to the Treasury described the sort of exercise Rishi Sunak was undertaking tonight as ‘rubbish in, rubbish out’.” Sir Ed Davey  said his team don’t tell him about his “stunts” until a few hours beforehand (Seren Hughes writes). Asked about his seriousness after a series of amusing photo ops, the Liberal Democrats leader said: “Politicians should be serious about voters’ concerns but I don’t think politicians should always take themselves too seriously. People want to know that politicians are real people.” In an interview with ITV, he said his job is to “get rid of as many Conservative MPs as possible”. Davey said every vote for a Lib Dem is a vote for “a local champion who will fight for that fair deal”. Those who voted for the Conservatives in 2019 overwhelmingly believe Rishi Sunak won the debate, snap polling shows (Max Kendix writes). YouGov polling of the demographic shows 85 per cent think the prime minister performed best overall, compared with 15 per cent for Keir Starmer. The veterans minister has admitted that the last 14 years of Conservative government have been “difficult”. Jonny Mercer also criticised Keir Starmer for not being “serious” about illegal immigration. Mercer said: “You can’t go through government saying, I’m sorry, and having platitudes and saying ‘we’re going to smash the gangs’. What does that even mean? I’m going to smash the gym one day, right? It just doesn’t mean anything at all. And this is not serious leadership.” The prime minister performed better than Sir Keir Starmer, according to YouGov polling about the debate (Seren Hughes and Max Kendix write). The polling showed 51 per cent of people thought Rishi Sunak performed better in tonight’s live debate, with 49 per cent voting for Starmer. Michael Gove  dismissed some of the audience responses. “There were some sympathetic claps,” Gove said. “British people clap politely even when someone is flailing.” He said: “I think I would have scored Rishi higher but it’s undoubtedly the case that Rishi won that debate. Consider that at the moment the opinion polls are telling us that Labour is significantly ahead. And yet the audience watching at home, recognise that Rishi won that debate, and that’s because Starmer was exposed.” Gove added that “it was the worst performance by any aspirant to be prime minister that I have seen in any leaders debate”. In his closing statement, Sunak said the contest was between him and Starmer, and that a “vote for anyone else makes it more likely it will be” the Labour leader (Seren Hughes writes). Sunak said: “I will always have your back, as I did with furlough. With Starmer, apart from higher taxes you don’t know what you will get. Starmer is asking you to hand him a blank cheque. In uncertain times we can’t afford an uncertain prime minister. Choose lower immigration, lower taxes, and protected pensions.” Things took a lighter tone at the end of the debate, with Julie Etchingham asking Sunak and Starmer about their leadership style in the context of the Euros this summer. Sunak said: “You need a clear plan and to take bold action.” Starmer’s response was that you need a “game plan” and a “good squad” and said Gareth Southgate, the England manager, had both. “I don’t offer you the gimmicks or unfunded promises,” Starmer said in his closing statement (Max Kendix writes). “I don’t pretend there’s a magic wand that will fix everything overnight. Instead, I offer a practical common sense plan to change. This election is about who our country works for; the simple patriotic belief that Britain can be better, and must be better.” He went on: “Imagine how you would feel waking up for July 5. Five more years of the Conservatives, five more years of decline and division. The arsonists handed back the matches. Now imagine turning the page with a Labour government that rolls up its sleeves or gets on with the job. That puts the country back in your service.” The two leaders have consistently talked at cross purposes this evening, and deliberately so (Max Kendix writes). Keir Starmer attempted to put Sunak in the dock for the last 14 years, while the prime minister has tried to emphasise the series of big policy announcements from the last two weeks of the election campaign. The Labour leader, often under his breath, has repeatedly called the prime minister’s attacks “absolute nonsense”. But he has failed to convincingly address them, especially the claim that Labour would raise taxes by more than £2,000. “He’s ashamed of the last 14 years,” Starmer said instead, pointing out that Sunak did not try to defend the record. “We’ve got to draw a line. We’ve got to turn a page.” The prime minister said he will stick to the targets his government have put in place on the environment “in a way that saves you all money”. He said installing a heat pump, converting a home or changing car would cost people more. He insisted Starmer would “force” people to make the changes “sooner than is necessary”. Starmer countered that the government is “slowing down on climate change” and said Sunak’s plan will “cost more in the long run”. He said clean power by 2030 would be in the Labour manifesto and reeled off his plans for renewable energy. In one of the final questions of the debate, the leaders have been asked how they will help the younger generation (Max Kendix writes). “What I won’t be doing is sending you on national service, some sort of teenage Dad’s Army”, the Labour leader said. Rishi Sunak responded that national service “will be transformational for young people” and “incredibly positive”. He accused Starmer of “sneering” at the announcement and said: “You don’t have big ideas like that.” Starmer said: “If it’s such a brilliant idea, why has your government for 14 years not lifted a finger to do it?” The two leaders found a point of agreement in the situation in Gaza (Seren Hughes writes). Starmer said: “What we need now is a ceasefire straight away. We have to get the hostages out. We desperately need humanitarian aid.” He added: “We have to find a path to a lasting resolution. There has to be a two-state solution.” Sunak said he was “pleased Starmer supported Israel’s right to defend itself” and said he supported the US deal for an immediate ceasefire and more aid. The prime minister said the world was a more “uncertain place”. He cited his “bold decision to increase investment in defence”, which he said was “something Labour has not matched”. Sir Keir Starmer says he wants the UK to use more renewable energy and end its reliance on fossil fuels. This would be continuing a trend that we have seen under the Conservatives (Joey D’Urso writes). Rishi Sunak has brought up Keir Starmer’s legal record for the first time, accusing him of representing extremist groups (Max Kendix writes). The prime minister told voters to “google it” after attacking Starmer for allegedly representing Abu Qatada, the Islamist preacher, and Hizb ut-Tahrir, an extremist group. Keir Starmer has attempted to draw a link between every topic debated this evening (Max Kendix writes). The Labour leader said there was a “pattern” in the failure of policy in education, healthcare and immigration. The promises that we make are not worth the paper they’re written on. His plan is failing”. He told Sunak: “We’re all living with the consequences of your awful decisions.” Sunak made his strongest suggestion yet that he could leave the ECHR (Seren Hughes writes). Asked about whether he would leave the ECHR, the prime minister said: “All our plans are compliant with international obligations.” He said that if he had to make a choice between “securing our borders or the country’s security, I will choose our country’s security”, adding that he would choose the country’s security “ahead of membership of a foreign court”. By contrast, Starmer vowed that his party “will not pull out of international agreements and internal law that is respected the world over”. “I want the UK to be a respected player on the international stage,” he said. Starmer said Sunak is “the most liberal prime minister we have ever had on immigration”. Steven from Warrington asked why he should trust either of them on immigration. Sunak said immigration is too high and we “need to take bold action”. He pointed to a new legal cap and a deterrent “ready to go”. “There will be no deterrent with Starmer,” Sunak said. Starmer responded by asking: “Who is in charge? He is the most liberal prime minister we have ever had on immigration.” Both leaders are saying they will bring down net migration, the number of people entering the country minus the number of people leaving. The numbers rose dramatically after the pandemic, but are beginning to fall to lower levels. Keir Starmer has said he would consider sending asylum seekers abroad for their claims to be looked at (Max Kendix writes). Asked if he would consider processing asylum claims in a third country, the Labour leader said: “Yes, if that was possible to do in compliance with international law.” Keir Starmer failed ten times to deny that a £2,094 tax rise is coming under Labour, the Conservatives have said. The tax analysis, done by Treasury officials before the election based on Labour policies drawn up by Conservative political advisers, was key to Rishi Sunak’s attack. It took Starmer a long time to respond to the figure, and then called them “nonsense”. But he did not provide a counter figure for Sunak’s plans, and instead tried to explain how the Treasury officials process worked. Pat McFadden, Labour’s campaign co-ordinator, tried to address them more directly, saying on social media: “Rishi Sunak’s claims about Labour and tax are categorically untrue. Labour will not put up taxes on working people.” Both leaders have already had difficult moments, which will surely be used in clips on party advertising for the rest of the campaign. Keir Starmer went into the debate hoping to be a prosecutor of the last 14 years of Conservative government, saying that “you may want to cast it off, but everybody else is living with it”. The prime minister claimed NHS waiting lists had come down — but Starmer hit back, pointing out that lists had come up and added: I thought he was meant to be good at maths.” The approach became stilted, however, when the debate shifted to how to end the strike by doctors. “We have to end the strike,” Starmer continued to say when questioned, and continuously referred back to Liz Truss without addressing the question. The prime minister used Labour’s policy on imposing VAT on private schools to say that Starmer will raise taxes. On education, Sunak said: “We’re backing our schools with record investment.” He added that English school children are the best readers in the western world. Starmer countered that we “desperately need more teachers”, citing his promise to recruit 6,500. On imposing VAT on private schools, Sunak said: “People who work hard should have that freedom. Starmer is going to raise taxes.” Rishi Sunak likes to talk about reading because this is an area the government can point to as a success (Joey D’Urso writes). In recent years, England has steadily risen up the PISA rankings, the internationally recognised assessment for measuring educational skills. (This relates to England because education is a devolved matter.) The first clear divide between the two leaders’ personal approach to the NHS has emerged. Asked whether they would pay for private healthcare if their family member was stuck on a waiting list, Rishi Sunak said yes while Keir Starmer said no. Asked about the strikes affecting the NHS, Starmer would only say: “We’ve got to resolve them.” Despite repeatedly being pushed by Sunak on what he would actually do, the Labour leader said: “We’ve got to bring down the waiting list. We’ve got a plan.” He added that his party wouldn’t pay the 35 per cent asked for by junior doctors but would “get in the room and negotiate”, which Sunak said his government had. Rishi Sunak has gone on the offensive against Sir Keir Starmer in the first part of the debate, but has struggled to dismiss questions about whether he can relate to the cost of living crisis. The prime minister repeated that Labour would increase people’s taxes by £2,000 and tried to focus on the future, an attack which Starmer has refused to engage in. Asked to focus on an emotional question from Paula, a member of the audience in Salford, the Labour leader hinted at Sunak’s personal wealth. He told her “I don’t think the prime minister quite understands the position you are in.” The prime minister could not provide an answer to Starmer’s story about not affording bills growing up, and instead repeated his attack on Labour. Turning to the NHS, Janet from Telford, a cancer survivor who lost a cousin waiting for surgery, said: “No one is brave enough to tell us the truth: the NHS is broken.” Starmer said the NHS “runs through my DNA” and he is angry it has been broken. “To leave the NHS in a worse state than you found it is unforgivable,” he said. Suank said he was “brought up in the NHS” and his parents spoke about how they could provide more care. “That is how I think about the NHS,” he said, citing record funding in training doctors and nurses. “The NHS is safe in my hands. I will always stand up for it.” Sir Keir Starmer says Rishi Sunak’s January 2023 pledge to get NHS waiting lists down has not been met. This is accurate. Rishi Sunak responded that the figure has been coming down in recent months, which is also accurate. Sunak says the pledge has not been met because the NHS has been affected by industrial action. Julie Etchingham pushed the leaders on what they are going to do about the cost of living. Sunak said: “Judge me by my actions. You saw what I did during the pandemic.” Starmer mentioned his parents, the tool maker and nurse, and said: “We didn’t have a lot of money when I was growing up. I know how that feels.” Keir Starmer said he knows how it feels not to pay the bills, after an audience member questioned how much the leaders know. “I don’t think the prime minister quite understands the position you are in,” the Labour leader said. Sunak responded that “things are tough, I want to make them easier”. Keir Starmer has called Rishi Sunak “the British expert on tax rises” as the leaders clash on the economy and cost of living (Max Kendix writes). Sunak responded: “Independent Treasury officials have costed Labour’s policy and they amount to a £2,000 tax rise. They will — mark my words — Labour will raise your taxes. It’s in their DNA: you name it, your work, your car, your pension, they will tax it.” Rishi Sunak is saying that Sir Keir Starmer would raise taxes if Labour wins the election (Joey D’Urso writes). Starmer is saying Sunak has put taxes up. The tax burden has risen significantly in recent years under the Conservatives. The prime minister pointed to his furlough scheme and the plan to bring inflation back to normal. He said the economy is growing, wages are rising and “we can start to cut your taxes” (Seren Hughes writes). “The choice is with my clear plan to keep cutting your taxes or put all that progress at risk under the Labour party.” Starmer said he wouldn’t pretend Ukraine and Covid hadn’t made things worse but pointed the finger at Liz Truss for “trashing the economy”. “It’s working people that pay the price. Truss is going to be a candidate at the next election. We need to stop the chaos.” The Labour leader has asked why Rishi Sunak has called an early election if he believes the plan is working (Max Kendix writes). “He knows inflation is going to go back up,” Keir Starmer said. “He knows energy prices are going to go back up in the winter. That’s what he’s not telling you. “So he says the plan is working, but I don’t think he believes the plan is working because if he thought the plan is working he wouldn’t have called this election right now.” Rishi Sunak says he has brought inflation down (Joey D’Urso writes). It is true that inflation has fallen significantly in recent months, although two years’ of significant price rises means that lots of people in the UK have faced a cost of living crisis. Sir Keir Starmer has said the election is “all about a choice” in his opening statement (Max Kendix writes). The Labour leader said: “This election is all about a choice: more of the chaos and division we’ve seen for the last 14 years, or turning the page and rebuilding with Labour. “I changed the Labour Party. I put it back in the service of working people. Now I’m seeking your backing to change our country to make it work.” “I will keep this simple,” Rishi Sunak said. “In five weeks either Keir Starmer or I will be prime minister. Beyond raising your taxes and raising your pensions, no one knows what Labour will actually do. But you know what I would do. I’ll cut your taxes, protect your pension and reduce immigration. I have a clear plan for a more secure future for you and your family.” At the media centre in ITV’s centre in Salford Quays, senior figures in both parties are gearing up to “spin” the televised debate (Max Kendix writes). From Labour, Pat McFadden, the national campaign co-ordinator, Shabana Mahmood, shadow justice secretary, and Jon Ashworth, shadow paymaster general, will attempt to convince journalists and commentators that Sir Keir Starmer won the debate. For the Conservatives, Michael Gove, the outgoing MP and levelling-up secretary, Victoria Atkins, the health secretary, and Johnny Mercer, the veterans minister, will be making the argument for Rishi Sunak’s performance. The two parties have laid the groundwork for the key areas of debate. A Conservative spokesman said they “don’t know what the public will get to see from Keir Starmer” as “it depends which version of himself he chooses to bring to the debate”. He claimed the debate would “expose the Labour Party’s complete absence of any new ideas, any principles and ultimately, that they do not have a plan”. McFadden, meanwhile, said that “British people will have a chance to see the choice first-hand” between “a desperate Rishi Sunak, whose scatter-gunned approach has shredded his economic credibility, [and] Keir Starmer, who has changed the Labour Party and is offering a credible plan to change Britain”. A new poll gives Labour an even bigger lead than yesterday’s YouGov projection, which was already bigger than Tony Blair’s landslide victory in 1997 (Seren Hughes writes). Survation’s first MRP of the general election suggests Labour is on track for a mammoth majority of 324 seats, the largest ever in modern British politics. The pollster’s projection gives Labour 487 seats, the Tories only 71 seats, the Lib Dems 43, the SNP 26 and Reform three. Its modelling estimates that Reform has a one in five chance of winning Clacton, where Nigel Farage is standing. However, interviews took place between May 22 and June 2, before Farage announced that he was standing at the election. Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak have arrived in Salford’s MediaCity, Greater Manchester, ahead of the first leaders’ debate of the general election campaign (Seren Hughes writes). Both leaders looked smart in suits, with the Labour leader opting for a patterned dark-red tie and the prime minister a blue one. Julie Etchingham will host the hour-long debate on ITV at 9pm. Present to support the prime minster are the health secretary Victoria Atkins and Claire Coutinho, the energy security secretary. The Green Party will conduct a full review of its health policy after concerns were raised over its pledge to reduce the number of medical interventions in childbirth (Seren Hughes writes). The party’s health policy document said there had been a rise in caesarean sections, which it described as “expensive and, when not medically required, risky”. A change to NHS culture was also proposed in the document to ensure that “birth is treated as a normal and non-medical event”. Green health spokeswoman Dr Pallavi Devulapalli said there was “no intention to stop or reduce medical care provision during pregnancy and childbirth”. The party also told the PA news agency there would be a “full review” of its health policy, which it said was “out of date”. Green Tories have urged their party not to “cede environmental leadership to the left” (Seren Hughes writes). Sam Hall, director of the  Conservative Environment Network , claimed the environment had consistently been among the public’s top-five issues during the parliament and said it would be “electorally wise” for all parties to set out “bold and practical policies to tackle climate change and restore nature”. “Parties should be competing over how to improve the environment, rather than [argue] whether climate change or nature loss are problems,” he said. “[The Tories] should put forward a positive environmental agenda for the next parliament that will protect our communities, our country and our planet for generations to come.” Tonight’s televised debate is the first of several chances for Rishi Sunak to land a blow on Sir Keir Starmer in an attempt to shift the polls, which have consistently put Labour on course for a landslide victory (Max Kendix writes). Another head-to-head battle will take place on the BBC on Wednesday, June 26. Potentially more eventful will be the seven-way debate on Friday between senior figures in seven parties, including Penny Mordaunt, Angela Rayner and Nigel Farage. On June 30 there will be another debate on ITV, though the line-up is yet to be finalised. Before that, a two-hour special edition of                     Question Time                     is set to include the leaders of the four largest parties on June 20. Election debates present a rare opportunity for politicians to interact live in front of a primetime audience but research shows their influence on the outcomes of elections tends to be modest (Max Kendix writes). There is typically very little impact on those who already have a firm party preference, and only slightly more on floating and undecided voters. Televised debates can change the mood of the campaign, as with the performance of Nick Clegg, then the Liberal Democrat leader, in 2010. But even then, the excitement around Clegg did not translate to the ballot box, where the party’s share of the vote increased by only one point, while it claimed five fewer seats than in 2005. Here is what to expect  from the televised clash between Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer. Labour and the Conservatives have set out their stalls for the rural vote (Seren Hughes writes). The environment secretary Stephen Barclay said that where Labour was in office, such as in Wales, it was “not in tune with rural communities”. Steve Reed, the shadow environment secretary, pledged to treat countryside communities with “respect”. Speaking at the Future Countryside conference in Syon Park, west London, Barclay said his focus for the countryside was on food production. Pointing to a new sustainable farming initiative, he said: “We are committed to nature, we are committed to the environment, but we are doing so in a way that works with our farming and our food production.” Meanwhile Reed, speaking at the same conference, said Labour would tackle issues including the housing crisis and rural crime, but not at the expense of the environment. “We all need nature but we stand at a moment in history when nature needs us to defend it,” he said. Nigel Farage believes his standing at the general election will increase voter turnout. Speaking on social media  from the Three Jays pub in Jaywick, in what he hopes to be his constituency of Clacton, the Reform UK leader said he had been planning to run in the seat before the general election was called but had wanted a “six-month run into it”. Now that he is standing after all, he said: “I think my standing will actually increase the turnout at the election and that is a good thing for democracy. The buzz, the mood here today, was unbelievable — in fact, I would say, unlike anything I have seen before.” Farage told viewers he was off to Normandy tomorrow for the D-Day anniversary and would be “TikToking a lot”. Labour has refused to commit to closing a loophole used by private schools to avoid a tax hike on fees in the new school year (Max Kendix writes). Several schools have introduced schemes allowing parents to pay years’ worth of school fees in advance. It could mean they avoid paying the  20 per cent VAT on fees  Labour has pledged to introduce in government. Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, suggested in January that the loophole could be closed by applying the rules retrospectively to include fees paid before a Labour government entered office. But asked today whether the VAT would be backdated, Peter Kyle, the shadow science secretary, said: “We want to close the tax gap with private schools. That VAT is a fair way of getting money into state schools … from there we’ve not made any other commitments on private schools.” Scotland’s social justice secretary has urged the next UK government to “be bold” in tackling child poverty (Seren Hughes writes). Speaking as the Scottish government published its annual child poverty action report,  Shirley-Anne Somerville  said: “The reality is that every progressive measure put in place in Scotland simply cannot go on being cancelled out by punitive Westminster welfare policies. “We need the next UK government, of whatever colour, to reset relations on welfare, to be bold and to take early action to match Scotland’s ambition. This includes key changes to welfare policies, such as the introduction of an essentials guarantee and the abolition of  the two-child limit , which could lift an estimated 40,000 children out of poverty overnight.” Whoever comes out on top in the general election faces a host of major challenges — not least a potential £12 billion fiscal “black hole” that could put in jeopardy both the main parties’ forthcoming manifesto commitments. The country’s finances have deteriorated markedly since the last budget in March, with the giant compensation package for victims of the infected blood scandal adding to the pressure. Economics correspondent Jack Barnett  explains what it all means  for Labour and the Conservatives. No politician goes out of their way to run an “old-style street campaign in the way that I do”, Nigel Farage has claimed (Ed Halford writes). In the wake of a woman throwing a milkshake at him, Reform’s leader criticised Rishi Sunak for not being prepared to interact with the public in the way Farage did in Clacton. “You know what does Rishi do:  he gets a room of two dozen councillors , or whatever it is,” Farage said. Farage said the incident this afternoon in which a protester in Clacton threw a milkshake at him was “quite frightening”. Conservative and Labour politicians have condemned the attack. The Scottish Labour leader has said parents of children at private schools should not be “gaming” the education system to demonstrate against  the party’s plan to add VAT to school fees  (Seren Hughes writes). Anas Sarwar was responding to reports that parents in an Edinburgh campaign group could sign up their children for state schools even if they do not intend to take up the place, as a protest against the policy. Sarwar told the PA news agency: “I think we have to focus on the fact that we have an education system that is requiring resource, that we have to make some difficult decisions in government, and this is one decision that we are making in order to attract more investment into our schools so we can improve the standard of education for children across the country.” Seven councillors have resigned from Labour in Slough, accusing the party of “institutional racism” over  its treatment of Diane Abbott and Faiza Shaheen  (Fintan Hogan writes). In an open letter, the officials took aim at Sir Keir Starmer’s position on Gaza and said the party had “betrayed” Slough, claiming councillors had been “gagged and silenced”. “We must stay true to our values and conscience, even if the party we once believed in has abandoned them,” the letter read. The comments mark an escalation of Starmer’s row with the left of his party over Abbott and Shaheen, who was blocked as a candidate over old tweets, and previews the potential for Labour support to leak to pro-Palestine independent candidates. Asked about the letter, Starmer said the party has “brilliant Labour teams out in every constituency”, insisting: “We’re in good form.” Angela Rayner would now “definitely vote to keep Trident”, despite voting against its renewal in 2016 (Seren Hughes writes). The Labour deputy leader told LBC: “I have never said I don’t want nuclear weapons at all. The nuclear deterrent triple lock is really important. When you see what’s happened with Putin invading Ukraine, it’s very clear that we need our nuclear armaments.” On Monday Rayner maintained that she would like to see multilateral disarmament. To LBC today, she added: “The vote some years ago [in 2016] didn’t mention multilateral disarmament. Margaret Thatcher wanted multilateral disarmament. “It’s been UK policy for a very long time and the world we live in at the moment, unfortunately, that is further away.” Both Labour and the Conservatives have condemned the milkshake attack on Nigel Farage (Seren Hughes writes). Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, called the assault “disgraceful” and James Cleverly, the home secretary, described it as “unacceptable”. Cleverly said: “There is no excuse to resort to behaviour like this. We may disagree, but we debate and then we vote. That’s democracy.” Farage’s Conservative opponent in Clacton added: “We may disagree, but every candidate has the right to campaign without fear of violence or intimidation.” James Cleverly has dismissed suggestions he could stand to become the next Conservative leader if the party suffers the defeat predicted in a major poll (Seren Hughes and Matt Dathan write). He said his focus remains on “returning a Conservative government with Rishi Sunak at the helm”. The home secretary added: “I would say that those people — whether they are in the media, completely legitimately, or in the party — who are planning for what happens after the general election should focus on influencing the outcome of the general election.” Meanwhile, Cleverly suggested the  Conservative Party manifesto would open the door  to leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Cleverly said the party would seek to reform the convention, pointing to the government’s success over the past year in pushing through changes to the European Court of Human Rights, which rules on alleged breaches. He said changes to the court’s procedures showed that reform could be achieved while remaining party to the convention. But he made clear that the option of quitting the convention altogether would be left on the table if attempts at further reforms were rebuffed. Speaking on a campaign visit to Rochester in Kent, he said recent decisions by the Strasbourg court had been “really wrong” and “overstepped the remit” of the ECHR. Asked whether the Conservative manifesto would include a pledge to leave the convention, Cleverly said: “We’ve absolutely made the point that the ECHR needs reform and we’ve already driven the form of the ECHR, which demonstrates that it can be done. “But the prime minister has been absolutely clear — I’ve been absolutely clear — our priority is to protect our borders to defend our nation and when we are presented, if we are presented, with a choice between defending ourselves or the views of a foreign court, we will always, always choose to defend our borders and defend our country.” Speaking for the first time since a milkshake was thrown over him in Clacton, Nigel Farage said: “My milkshake brings all the people to the rally.” He spoke to journalists while stood in front of Reform UK’s battle bus holding up a McDonald’s banana milkshake. His response was a reference to the song  by Kelis . Lord Finkelstein does not think Reform UK can ever be the mainstream party of the right. The Conservative peer and Times columnist said on the  podcast  he believed there was a “limit” to how much support Reform could get but that “it can increase the size of the Conservative defeat”. On the same podcast, Lord Mandelson said Nigel Farage’s decision to stand as an MP for Reform was a “calamity” for the Tories and could encourage them to replace Rishi Sunak with Penny Mordaunt before the end of the election campaign. There was also a risk to Labour due to Farage’s ability to “capsize” a campaign and “skew” the debate towards his agenda, the Labour peer admitted. “It could syphon off some of the oxygen of the campaign away from Labour’s campaign,” Mandelson said. Two people have been arrested after Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage had a milkshake thrown over him while he launched his campaign in Clacton (Ed Halford writes). Essex police said a 25-year-old woman had been arrested on suspicion of assault. While making the arrest, the force said, a man was detained on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker. “Both individuals remain in custody for questioning,” a police spokesman said. Farage was leaving a Wetherspoons pub and was speaking to journalists when a woman threw a milkshake over his face and suit jacket. Harriet Harman is trying — but failing — to keep control of her “giddy optimism” at the prospect of a Labour win, she said on Andrew Neil’s Times Radio show (Seren Hughes writes). The former Labour MP and Mother of the House said Labour HQ was telling members to “dampen down expectations” but admitted she was struggling to do so because “it feels like the Conservatives have come to the end of the road”. Harman said Labour had a “mountain to climb” from the party’s 2019 result, adding: “I’m trying to keep control of my giddy optimism, but actually failing.” Michael Gove, who also appeared on the show, said any candidate “needs to inhale the optimism gas”. Nigel Farage is “not a friend” of the Conservatives and is on an “ego trip”, according to Michael Gove (Seren Hughes writes). The minister said on Andrew Neil’s Times Radio show the Reform UK leader should “be careful what he wishes for” because “if he is successful in his aims, then we will have a Labour majority, which will undo all of the things for which he has claimed credit”. “He will be directly to blame for having ushered in a leftward shift in British politics,” Gove continued. “So yes, Nigel Farage has been admirably honest. But A, it’s an ego trip; and B, he’s also said that  he wants to destroy the Conservative Party . I’m all for working with people from other parties but if someone says it’s their explicit aim to grind you into bone meal, then they’re not your friend.” Diane Abbott has said she will be “campaigning for Labour victory” after the party confirmed she would be standing again (Chris Smyth writes). The Labour national executive committee rubber-stamped the party’s list of candidates today without any attempt to purge more left-wingers. Abbott was formally told she would be Labour’s candidate in Hackney North & Stoke Newington after the party leadership was forced to retreat on its attempt to block her from standing after a party outcry. While  Abbott rounded on Sir Keir Starmer during the row , this afternoon she said she and her local party “welcome my endorsement as Labour candidate”. She said she was “looking forward to campaigning for Labour victory”, adding in an echo of Starmer’s campaign message: “The Tories have decimated our communities and our country. Time for a change.” The milkshake thrown at Nigel Farage earlier today will win Reform “hundreds of thousands more votes’, the party’s chairman and former leader has claimed (Ed Halford writes). Responding to the incident outside a Wetherspoons pub in Clacton, Richard Tice wrote on Twitter/X: “We will not be bullied or threatened off the campaign trail.” Brendan Cox, widower of Jo Cox, the Labour MP who was shot and stabbed to death in a politically motivated attack during the European referendum campaign, also condemned the splattering of Farage with a milkshake. “Throwing things at politicians isn’t OK. No matter who they are,” he tweeted. Giles Watling, the previous Clacton MP and Conservative Party candidate for the seat, expressed a similar sentiment, writing on Twitter/X that “every candidate has the right to campaign without fear of violence or intimidation”. The “war on universities” will end under a Labour government, a shadow minister has said as he accused Rishi Sunak of “talking down” British institutions (Max Kendix writes). At a visit to Keele University, near Stoke, Peter Kyle, the shadow secretary for science, innovation and technology, said: “Just this week we’ve heard the prime minister stand up and for the second time in six months  talk about ‘Mickey Mouse courses’ . “This is heard around the world within a nanosecond — to have a prime minister that’s talking down our incredible university higher education sector. “That war against universities will stop if there’s a Labour government.” The woman who threw a milkshake at Nigel Farage in Clacton has explained her reasoning, saying she “just felt like it”. Speaking to the BBC after the incident, the young woman, who would only give her name as Victoria, said it was not a premeditated attack. “He doesn’t stand for me, he doesn’t represent anything I believe in, or any of the people around here,” she said. “He doesn’t represent us, he’s not from here.” The last time Nigel Farage was hit with a drink was in May 2019 when a protester doused him with a £5.25 salted caramel and banana milkshake from the fast food chain Five Guys while the politician was on a walkabout in Newcastle city centre. Paul Crowther was arrested and charged with common assault over the incident. He pleaded guilty and was handed a 12-month community order, including 150 hours of unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay Farage £350 compensation to cover costs such as suit cleaning and “distress and inconvenience”. The former Sky employee was dismissed after the incident. Nigel Farage came out of Clacton Wetherspoons to the sound of cheers but not quite everyone is a fan, it seems (Tom Peck writes). The woman on the steps had, we are told, been lurking with her locally purchased banana milkshake for quite some time. It appeared to be from McDonald’s. She scored a direct hit. It meant that Reform’s brand-new leader had to begin his open-top bus tour on the lower deck, in the company of his aides and a large-ish flannel. It is perhaps not the start he would have wanted. The futuristic set for tonight’s head-to-head debate has been revealed. It will begin at 9pm on ITV, with Julie Etchingam hosting. Faiza Shaheen, the former Labour candidate in Chingford & Woodford Green who was ousted over her social media activity, has resigned from the party. Sir Keir Starmer was accused of purging the left of his party when Shaheen, alongside Lloyd Russell-Moyle and Diane Abbott, was blocked from standing. This was denied by Starmer who said, after a few days of backlash, she was “free” to stand. Writing on social media, Shaheen said: “My removal shows that the desires of local members and my community mean nothing to the people at the top of the party. “I cannot, in all conscience, continue to contribute to a party that seems to think so little of people like me and has moved so far away from my values.” Shaheen, who stood for Labour in the seat in 2019, may still run as an independent. Reform UK has overtaken the Liberal Democrats to occupy third place in the polls. Its leader, Nigel Farage, wants to lead a “political revolt” and plans to place candidates in nearly every constituency. So, let’s take a closer look. Who are Reform UK? Who is funding the party? And what do they stand for?                    Read in full:                    Reform UK policies — what is Nigel Farage’s vision? Nigel Farage said the Tories deserved to be punished for their betrayal over Brexit. At a rally in Clacton, he said: “We made an offer to the British people, we could get back our independence and control of our borders. “But what has happened? The Conservatives have betrayed that trust. They’ve opened up the borders to mass immigration like we’ve never seen before. “And they deserve to pay a price for that, a big price for that.” Nigel Farage has asked the people of Clacton to “reactivate a people’s army” in a bid to get him elected. He said he “genuinely believed” his life in the public eye was over until deciding to stand. “We want to win this. We want to win it big,” he added. “I hope having a national figure representing this constituency will put Clacton on the map. No longer will you be at the end of the line, no longer will you be ignored.” Making his pitch, he said: “My record is, I take on the European Union, I take on the banking establishment. And what I will do if you give me the honour of being your member of parliament is I will stand up and fight for people, I will stand up and fight for small business against the regulators, I will stand up and fight for people to get their rights, I will stand up and fight to make sure that schools are not poisoning the minds of your children and grandchildren.” Nigel Farage has promised to “liven up” parliament as the voice of opposition if he is elected come July 5. Speaking in front of a crowd of hundreds in front of the ferris wheel at Clacton Pier, the new leader of Reform UK said: “This election effectively is over. That breach of trust from the Conservatives means they are finished, they’re done. We are going to get a Labour government whether you like it or not.  “The question is: who is gonna be the voice of opposition? I want Reform UK with me at the helm to be in Parliament and I promise you, I promise you I’ll liven it up a lot from what it currently is.” “You won’t get any woke PC nonsense from me because I’ve always told it as it is and stood up for what I believe in.” He added: “Send me to parliament to be a bloody nuisance.” Labour is on course for an “overwhelming win” at the next election, a red wall Tory candidate has admitted as he appealed to Nigel Farage to withdraw Reform candidates from seats with right-wing Tory MPs. Marco Longhi, who will fight to retain his Dudley North seat in the general election, praised Farage and said he deserved a peerage for what he had achieved. He said: “Nigel is a hugely talented politician. He should have been given recognition for what he has delivered over the past couple of decades. “I’m terribly sad that we are all in the same tent here politically.”                    Read in full:                    Don’t split the right-wing vote, Tory begs Farage The Conservative Party manifesto will not be “dictated” by Nigel Farage, the home secretary has said. James Cleverly insisted the Tories would not change tack in light of Farage’s decision to stand in the election or Monday’s polls showing Labour is on course for a bigger landslide victory than Tony Blair’s in 1997. He was visiting a haulage company in Rochester, Kent. Asked whether the Conservatives will need to move further to the right to prevent voters ditching the party for Reform, Cleverly said: “Conservative policies are created with the British people in mind. “And our policies are not dictated by any [other] party.” All 6,000 candidates will be offered the same security support as MPs during the general election. In a change of policy from 2019, all will be provided with a range of protection from basic physical and cyber security advice to, in extreme cases, close personal protection. Whitehall sources said security would be assessed on a case-by-case basis depending on the “risk and vulnerability” of individual candidates. At the same time the security services have warned that the UK is facing a “sharp” mix of threats to the election including political interference from Russia, China and Iran. These include potential cyber attacks and attempts to use social media to sow discord. Government sources said that these were not notional risks pointing to “real” examples of interference seen in other European countries. They said there had been attempts to interfere with the 2019 general election and since then the threats had evolved and become more difficult. The protection for candidates will be paid for out of a £30 million fund set aside for the general election campaign and will kick in at the close of nominations. The Times’s data team has compiled a poll of polls that puts Labour 22 points ahead of the Tories. Sir Keir Starmer is on track for a historic victory, while Rishi Sunak’s party is set for a defeat reminiscent of the 1997 general election result. Over the next month, we will be using voting intention data from pollsters to gauge the public’s perception of each party.                    Read in full:                    General election poll tracker — who will win the vote? Sir Keir Starmer has faced some awkward questions as he met a group of voters on a campaign visit. At the Bridge Cafe in Bolton, one woman called Pauline, to lots of laughs, asked the Labour leader: “Where do you sleep?” “That’s a very forward question. Everything is above board, as it should be …” Starmer replied. Mandy Snelgrove, a lifelong Conservative voter has said she will now vote for Labour after meeting Starmer. “He’s lovely. He’s more handsome today than I thought. I think he’s a very, very nice man,” she said. Nigel Farage has denied that he could have been bought off with a peerage, saying reducing immigration is the only thing that would have convinced him not to stand. Dismissing the House of Lords as “corrupt as hell”, Farage said he would not want to sit in the upper house “with that bunch of old crusties”, despite speculation that the Conservatives would have offered him a peerage as part of a non-aggression pact. After Farage stood down his Brexit party in Conservative-held seats in 2019, he said that “the one thing” that would have stopped him standing was if the Tories had kept their promises to reduce immigration. “The basis upon which I stood down and [more than] 300 seats and said to the country ‘look, you can vote for Boris if you want to’, was they would actually deliver the Brexit that people voted for,” he told LBC. “And you know what they’ve done? The opposite.” Nigel Farage said he decided to stand for parliament out of a “terrible sense of guilt” that he was letting down his supporters. After initially saying he would sit out the election to concentrate on helping Donald Trump during his campaign in the US, Farage said “a real feeling that I was letting people down” had made him change his mind. “The absolute deciding factor were the number of people I met in the street last week in Kent, in Lincolnshire, in Nottinghamshire, everywhere I went, people coming up, looking at me and saying, ‘why are you not standing?’ And I’d explain why I was not standing and I saw a sort of slump of the shoulders … ‘Nigel, we supported you for years’,” he told LBC. “I just got this terrible sense of guilt that I was actually letting them down and that I actually had to step up and do something”. Sir Keir Starmer has admitted he has not spoken to Diane Abbott in months despite the row over her Labour candidacy. She will find out if she will be allowed to stand as the party’s representative in Hackney North & Stoke Newington at a meeting of the national executive committee this evening. Asked ahead of the meeting when he last spoke to Abbott, Starmer said: “I have spoken to Diane two or three months ago, my team have obviously been speaking to her, but that decision is taken, that’s clear.” Last week, Starmer said Abbott was “free” to run as a Labour candidate despite a briefing The Times that she would be not be allowed to stand for the party. With polling day exactly a month away, we have outlined the key moments and events. Highlights include: a seven-way party leader debate on Friday for the BBC; a similar one for ITV on June 13; and another Sunak v Starmer showdown on June 26 — also for the BBC. Manifestos are expected to be published between 18 and 29 days before the election and voters must be registered by June 18 — the deadline for proxy voting is set to be June 26.                    Read in full:                    General election key dates — from TV debates to manifestos Nigel Farage can win in Clacton if he campaigns on local issues and talks more about GP surgeries than Europe or immigration, a former MP for the seat has said. Douglas Carswell, who became the first ever Ukip MP when he defected from the Tories in 2014, said he is “thrilled” his old party leader is standing. He won the seat in a by-election for Ukip that year and then again in 2015. “Nigel needs to go local to win,” he said. “He needs to talk to people on their doorsteps, not blast them from loudspeakers on a bus.” “By voting in Nigel, Clacton will not change the likelihood of a Keir Starmer landslide. But it might just help conservative Britain make the changes we need in order to one day present an alternative.” Bookmakers have made Farage favourite for the seat, which in 2019 returned a Conservative majority of more than 24,000 votes. The leaders of the Labour and Conservative parties will face each other on ITV at 9pm tonight for the first televised debate of this year’s general election. Many believe this is Rishi Sunak’s big (and maybe last chance) to reduce Sir Keir Starmer’s lead in the polls. It is their first opportunity to address the public on a such a large platform and both are aware that this will be the moment where many voters sit up and take notice for the first time — and right on cue as the first postal ballots land on their doorsteps.                    Read in full:                    What to expect from Sunak v Starmer Nigel Farage has said his long-term aim is to “take over” the Conservative Party. He has ruled out any pact with the Tories and, despite overtures from the Conservative right, said he could not stand for the party “as they currently are”. But he said: “You can speculate as to what’ll happen in three or four years’ time, all I will tell you is if Reform succeed in the way that I think they can, then a chunk of the Conservative Party will join us — it’s the other way around.” He cited the obliteration of the Canadian Conservatives in the 1990s, which led to a “reverse takeover” by another right-wing party called Reform. “Stephen Harper, who was elected as a Reform MP, became the Canadian prime minister for ten years,” Farage told ITV’s                     Good Morning Britain                    . “I don’t want to join the Conservative Party, I think the better thing to do would be to take it over.” Labour’s controversial candidate selection process will ensure “discipline and unity of purpose” in government, the party’s campaign co-ordinator has said. Pat McFadden insisted that Labour remained a “broad church” despite a series of controversies over last-minute deselections of candidates on the left and the imposition of those favoured by the leadership. Labour’s national executive committee will finalise the slate of candidates today after Sir Keir Starmer was forced to retreat on an  attempt to block Diane Abbott  from stan ding. But he faced criticism over deselecting Faiza Shaheen in Chingford & Woodford Green over historical social media activity in a last-minute Zoom call she was forced to attend with her baby. McFadden said he had no knowledge of the case and could not interfere. But asked if Starmer was stifling left-wing views, he told                     Today                     on BBC Radio 4: “We will have a broad church but we also have a situation where candidates are expected to support the party leadership and the party policy. That’s important if you’re going to have the discipline and the unity of purpose that’s needed to govern the country.” One of the reasons that Rishi Sunak opted for a summer election, against the advice of many Tory MPs and strategists, was the sense that voters had stopped listening (Chris Smyth writes).  The prime minister was frustrated that the electorate, tuned out to politics after years of turmoil, was giving him no credit for tax cuts or immigration reform: an election campaign was therefore a way to force people to give the Conservatives a hearing again. Almost two weeks in, the plan has not yet worked. The polls have barely budged with YouGov’s MRP showing the Tories are still on course for disaster. This makes tonight’s head-to-head debate with  Sir Keir Starmer  a last chance saloon for the prime minister. It represents one of the few remaining set-piece moments where Sunak can reset relations with voters and persuade them to listen to his offer for the next five years, rather than pass judgment on the last 14.  A good performance will not be enough — he needs a breakthrough. Tonight’s leadership debate will allow  Rishi Sunak  to start to turn around Labour’s huge poll lead, the home secretary has said (Chris Smyth writes). James Cleverly acknowledged the Conservatives have “a job to do” after a seat-by-seat YouGov poll found Sir Keir Starmer on course for a majority bigger than Tony Blair’s in 1997. Cleverly insisted he was “not convinced” the polls were right after the projection that the Tories would be reduced to 140 seats. Saying that Starmer had “spectacularly failed to convince”, Cleverly told Sky News: “Whether it’s through the debates tonight or through the next couple of weeks, increasingly British people will see that these turbulent times handing control of the country to a man who doesn’t even really seem to be in control of his own shadow cabinet is probably not a good idea.” There are “no circumstances whatsoever” in which Reform UK candidates will stand aside in constituencies for the Conservative Party, Nigel Farage has said (Laurence Sleator writes). He said he and voters have been “betrayed” by the Conservative Party which he said is a “ruined” brand. “We were told we would get control on our borders, we were told immigration numbers would come down. They have exploded. “I feel betrayed by them, millions of voters feel betrayed by them, even though there are some people in the Conservative Party I fought [alongside] during Brexit and other battles. “I’m afraid they’re part of a party who are well past their sell-by date. The brand is ruined. They’ve lost the election already. I am trying to establish a voice of opposition to what is going to be a Labour government that otherwise might be out of control.” Up to 600,000 migrants would be allowed into Britain every year by Reform, Nigel Farage has said (Chris Smyth writes). The party’s new leader said that skilled immigration would continue “in limited numbers” across a range of sectors, including care workers. He contrasted this with construction workers, where “we literally don’t need any” foreign workers. But he said with 500,000 people leaving the UK every year there was “plenty of room” for overseas workers while bringing net migration towards zero. “You’d still have room within the labour market for up to 600,000 people,” he told                     Today                     on BBC Radio 4. “Now hopefully, we wouldn’t need that many but it still leaves plenty of room.” He insisted: “We cannot go on as we are, we have to limit numbers, our lives, our quality of life in this country is being diminished by the population explosion. If that means that in some sectors, there’d be shortages what that then means is that wages would go up and we’d start to encourage people to learn skills rather than heading off to university.” Nigel Farage has admitted a Reform UK policy to process asylum claims in British overseas territories is not “terribly practical” and pledged to “sort it out” (Laurence Sleator writes). Asked how the policy would work, he told the BBC: “That would be up to us wouldn’t it and they’d get money for doing it but hopefully we wouldn’t need to do it. Pressed further, he said: “I don’t think it’s terribly practical.” The interviewer replied: “The policy you’ve put forward?” “I think it’s very difficult policy to make work and I haven’t put it forward by the way.” “Why’s it on your website?” Farage replied: “Well I took over yesterday so give me more than 12 hours and I’ll sort a few things out.” The Liberal Democrats have pledged to provide free day-to-day care for adults in need, including the elderly and disabled (George Sandeman writes). Sir Ed Davey, the party’s leader, described the issue as being “deeply personal for me” having spoken about looking after his disabled son and ill mother. The party said provision of care should be based on need rather than ability to pay. They said their plan for England — based on the model introduced in 2002 by the Scottish Liberal Democrats in Holyrood — would cost £2.7 billion a year by 2028-29. They said it would be “fully funded” by reversing tax cuts for the big banks introduced in 2016 and that their plan could also save the NHS up to £3 billion a year through reduced pressure on their services. “Far too often, family carers are being left to pick up the pieces because the care system simply isn’t there for them,” said Davey. “Millions of people are going without the care they need, while thousands are stuck in hospital beds. “We cannot fix the crisis facing the NHS without fixing the crisis facing social care.” Nigel Farage is launching his latest campaign to become an MP at noon after announcing he would be running in the Essex constituency of Clacton (George Sandeman writes). The former leader of the Ukip and Brexit parties called a press conference on Monday afternoon to say he would be standing for election to Westminster for the eighth time. He will also take over as leader of Reform UK. Farage, 60, had said he wouldn’t run but revealed he had changed his mind after being repeatedly asked to do so by members of the public while campaigning over the past fortnight. The seaside town was touted as a possible landing spot for Farage with voters having returned a Ukip candidate to Westminster in 2014 and 2015.                    Read more:                    Farage’s energetic return is Sunak’s worst nightmare Great British Energy would protect British households and “close the door on Putin”, Sir Keir Starmer has said (George Sandeman writes). The Labour leader plans to set up a publicly owned clean energy company if elected and criticised the Conservatives for leaving Britons exposed to sharply fluctuating international energy prices, such as those seen following  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine . “Energy policy is now a matter of national security. It is a key component of our country’s resilience and capacity to weather future shocks,” Starmer said. “We simply cannot afford to remain as vulnerable to price spikes as we have been in the past. Keeping the lights on and heating our homes should not mean leaving our front door open to Russia.” He added: “With Great British Energy, my changed Labour Party will close the door on Putin.” The party says the firm will be headquartered in Scotland and funded through a windfall tax on big oil and gas firms, with an initial £8.3 billion capitalisation over the course of a parliament. The Conservatives claim Labour’s plan for oil and gas in Britain would lead to the industry’s taps being turned off (George Sandeman writes). Douglas Ross, the party’s leader in Scotland, said halting oil and gas developments would risk economic health and be environmentally questionable. He said: “The entire economy of northeast Scotland is on the line at this election because of the reckless plans of Labour and the SNP to turn off the taps in the North Sea. “It is economic and environmental lunacy to turn away from oil and gas, as Labour, the SNP, Greens and Lib Dems are intent on doing, because it would see tens of thousands of skilled jobs lost and force us to import more expensive fossil fuels with a greater carbon footprint.” Speaking in Scotland last week, Sir Keir Starmer said: “We are not turning off the taps, oil and gas will be part of the mix for many years. We’re not revoking any licences.” However, he said a “transition is coming” with a switch of focus to renewables.  The shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves is campaigning in Scotland today where she will meet leading figures from the nation’s financial services industry (George Sandeman writes). Reeves, a former economist at the Bank of England, will pledge to unleash the nation’s “economic firepower” at an event in Edinburgh. Ahead of the visit, she said: “Scotland’s financial services industry is one of the UK’s greatest assets, supporting thousands of jobs and billions of pounds investment to our shores. “That is why I was proud to launch our review of financial services in Edinburgh last year and why I can announce that we will deliver on it. “The SNP in Holyrood and the Conservatives in Westminster have let Scotland’s economy down, so it falls to Labour to help pick it back up and deliver the change we need. “I will unleash Scotland’s economic firepower to deliver jobs and growth because when Scotland succeeds, we all succeed.” Last year Reeves announced her party would conduct a review of financial services as part of a plan to “restore growth to Britain”. Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will face each other in their first television debate of the campaign which comes a day after Labour were projected to be on track for a historic win (George Sandeman writes). The one hour debate on ITV starts at 9pm and will be held in front of a live studio audience. Members of the public have been invited to submit questions that might be put to the party leaders. The MRP model  published by YouGov yesterday  showed that if a general election were held today Labour would win 422 seats with a majority of 194. It would surpass the New Labour landslide in 1997, the party’s best ever result, when they won 418 seats and earned a 179-seat majority. Sunak and the Conservatives are projected to win 140 seats with four cabinet ministers, including Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, and Grant Shapps, the defence secretary, expected to lose theirs. Such a result would be their worst in more than a century; they won 131 seats in 1906. In the postwar period their worst result was in 1997 when they won 165 seats.
