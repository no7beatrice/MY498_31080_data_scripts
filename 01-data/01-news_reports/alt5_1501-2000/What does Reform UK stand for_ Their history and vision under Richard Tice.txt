   What does Reform UK stand for? Their history and vision under Richard Tice telegraph.co.uk March 7, 2024 Thursday 11:50 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:2 Length: 786 words Byline: By Dominic Penna, Political Correspondent Highlight: The former Brexit party has surged in the polls by outflanking Tory policy and capitalising on fortuitous circumstances Body   Founded in 2021 as a relaunch of the Brexit Party, Reform UK  has surged to as high as 14 percentage points in the opinion polls  and is costing the Conservatives  significant support among voters on the political Right ahead of the next election.  It now has its first MP in the House of Commons after Lee Anderson, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, defected on March 11, 2024 after his suspension over a row about Sadiq Khan, insisting Reform will allow him to “speak my mind”. Richard Tice  and Nigel Farage  announced the Brexit Party would become Reform on November 1, 2020 in an article for The Telegraph published at the start of the second Covid lockdown. Mr Tice and Mr Farage used the joint article  to declare “lockdowns don’t work” and instead advocated a policy of “focused protection” for the most vulnerable. They also called for sweeping reform of major institutions beyond the pandemic. In March 2021 Mr Farage, who had led the Brexit Party for the previous two years, resigned from frontline politics  and handed the reins over to Mr Tice, who remains Reform’s leader. Reform stood candidates at the London Assembly, Scottish Parliament and Senedd elections in 2021. Though failing to pick up any seats, the party gathered just over 42,500 supporters across all three elections. The same year it won two council seats  in the local elections , both in Derby.                      Reform UK polls                     The party’s backing in the polls remained largely static throughout 2021, averaging around three percentage points, although it had risen to an average of six per cent by the end of 2022 amid growing public frustration with the Conservative Party in the wake of the deposition of Boris Johnson  and Liz Truss.  Mr Tice’s fortunes improved vastly during 2023 and the early months of 2024, with average support for Reform almost doubling  from six per cent in January 2023 to 10.1 per cent at the start of March. The rise of Reform can be attributed to a combination of the party’s policy offer and fortuitous circumstances.                      Reform UK policies                     On the economic front, it has promised sweeping cuts  to levies including corporation tax and inheritance tax at a time when Rishi Sunak and Jeremy Hunt are overseeing the country’s highest tax burden since the Second World War , with a further peak projected later this decade. Despite successive Conservative governments promising to cut immigration, net migration reached record levels in 2022  and Mr Tice has cited this “betrayal” by the Tory government  of its past manifesto pledges as a driving force behind his party’s success. Research from the More in Common think tank in February 2022 found that immigration was the main reason 2019 Tory voters were defecting to Reform, with around one in five of those who backed Boris Johnson and his party at the last election expected to support Mr Tice. Reform’s promises on border control  include “net zero immigration”, leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) – a demand made by many Tory backbenchers, and a popular idea among the party’s grassroots – and declaring illegal immigration as a national security threat. Mr Tice has also vowed to abolish the Government’s flagship net zero targets, claiming that the green push is doing more damage to the British economy than anything else. There was a further bounce in support for Reform following Mr Sunak’s November reshuffle, in which Suella Braverman was sacked as Home Secretary over her criticism of pro-Palestinian protests, which she dubbed “hate marches”. The same reshuffle took Westminster by surprise with the return of Lord Cameron  as the new Foreign Secretary, a move that angered many on the Tory Right as the former prime minister is widely perceived to be on the liberal wing of the party. Mr Tice told GB News at the time: “The truth is our server has almost exploded with fury at what’s happened today with the return of David Cameron. Let’s remember this is the gentleman who campaigned against Brexit, and almost everything he did on foreign policy was wrong.” Mr Tice recently reinstated “the Brexit party” as a Reform slogan, recalling the populist appeal of its precursor, led by Mr Farage. As a result of its outflanking of the Conservatives on the Right in many policy areas  and channelling the disillusionment of traditional Tories with its rhetoric, the party may well have an even greater impact at the next general election  than in 2019, when it stood aside from seats held by Mr Johnson’s Tory candidates. Now commanding the support of around one in ten voters, the party could block Mr Sunak from winning in dozens of seats he may otherwise retain. Load-Date: May 3, 2024  End of Document
