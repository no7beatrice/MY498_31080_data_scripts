   Michael Gove to step down at election telegraph.co.uk May 24, 2024 Friday 8:30 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:4 Length: 12582 words Byline: By Ben Riley-Smith, Political Editor and Dominic Penna, Political Correspondent and Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor and Max Stephens Body   Michael Gove has announced that he is stepping down as an MP, becoming the biggest name in a Tory exodus after Rishi Sunak surprised colleagues with his snap election. The Communities Secretary, who has been in Cabinet for most of the Conservatives’ 14 years in power, said it was time for a “new generation” of political leaders. Mr Gove’s announcement brings to an enda 19-year parliamentary career  that included being education secretary, chief whip, justice secretary, environment secretary and chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Follow Telegraph’s general election live blog                                             His career was also marked by public fallouts with Lord Cameron  and Boris Johnson. His decision comes after polling analysis showed his hopes of re-election in Surrey Heath were on a knife edge. He was projected to win by just 1 per cent, fuelling accusations from the Liberal Democrats that he was “running scared”.Mr Gove won the Surrey Heath seat at the 2019 election with a majority of more than 18,000.He said in a letter to his Tory association chairman: “I know the toll office can take, as do those closest to me. No one in politics is a conscript.“We are volunteers who willingly choose our fate. And the chance to serve is wonderful. But there comes a moment when you know that it is time to leave. That a new generation should lead.”By Friday evening, 78 Conservative MPs had announced theywould not be standing for re-election, exceeding the previous record set in 1997, when New Labour stormed to victory.That amounts to around one in five of the Tories who won in the 2019 election. Eleven have quit in the two days after Mr Sunak revealed his shock summer election, with more expected.The other 10 are Dame Andrea Leadsom, Greg Clark, Craig Mackinlay, Sir John Redwood, Sir David Evennett, Dame Eleanor Laing, Jo Churchill, Huw Merriman, James Grundy, and Sir Michael Ellis.Dame Andrea, a former business secretary and Tory leadership contender, confirmed on Friday night that she would not be standing for re-election.The rush for the door has distracted from the early days of Mr Sunak’s campaign, and Downing Street’s message that the Tories have a chance of pulling off a surprise victory and are united in taking the fight to Labour.Mr Gove is one of the most well-known Conservative politicians of the past two decades, having been at the centre of Lord Cameron’s modernisation drive that won back power in 2010.He remainsbest known for his education reforms , which saw free schools at arms-length from the state created across the country. Labour is not proposing to reverse the changes.But Mr Govesplit spectacularly with Lord Cameron when he backed Brexit  and helped lead the Leave campaign. He then infuriated Boris Johnson  by flipping from chief supporter to critic of his subsequent leadership bid.Mr Gove also ran twice for the Conservative Party leadership himself, losing to Theresa May in 2016 and losing to Mr Johnson in 2019.Mr Gove wrote in his letter: “I am proud to have led the Vote Leave campaign alongside Boris Johnson and Gisela Stuart – which secured the largest mandate in modern British history for a vote to Leave the European Union and take back control of our political destiny.“Fundamentally our country is stronger with politicians in Westminster able to control our laws, our borders and our money. Since 2016 we have also increased NHS funding by considerably more than £350 million a week.“Throughout my time in politics, although I have undoubtedly made mistakes, I have always tried to be a voice for those who have been overlooked and undervalued. I have tried to fight for greater social justice. My education reforms were designed to build a country where everyone – no matter their background – can become the authors of their own life stories.“For me, that is what being in Parliament and being in government is all about.”A poll by YouGov last month projected Mr Gove was on track to keep his Surrey Heath seat by a margin of just one per cent, with the Conservatives on 33 per cent and the Liberal Democrats 32 per cent.As soon as the election was called on Wednesday, Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, went to a campaign launch event in Surrey Heath, with the party claiming cabinet ministers including Mr Gove “will be looking nervously over their shoulders”.Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: “Conservative politicians are fleeing the blue wall in their droves. Michael Gove is running scared of the Liberal Democrats. The drumbeat of Conservative MPs stepping down has been getting louder as the days go by – now it’s deafening.”You can recap a dramatic day below and join the conversation in the comments section here. 24 May 2024-07:29PM GMTThat’s all for today...Thank you for joining The Telegraph’s coverage of a remarkable second day of the general election campaign. Here is a recap of what went down today in Westminster and beyond:Rishi Sunak is facing the greatest ever Tory Party exodus before a general election with 77 Conservative MPs standing down, breaking the record that was set ahead of Sir Tony Blair’s 1997 election landslide.Michael Gove, Mr Sunak’s Levelling Up Secretary, sensationally resigned on Friday night, writing: “The chance to serve is wonderful. But there comes a moment when you know that it is time to leave.”The Liberal Democrats went on to claim that Mr Gove is “running scared” of their party in the wake of polls showing the contest would have been virtually neck-and-neck.Former ministers Sir David Evennett, Greg Clark and Sir John Redwood, and Craig Mackinlay, who returned to the House of Commons this week after his sepsis ordeal, also confirmed they are not running for re-election.Parents are pulling children out of private school after Sir Keir Starmer promised a tax raid on “day one” of a Labour government.Sir Keir also refused to commit to a Tory challenge to take part in six general election TV debates with Mr Sunak in the run up to July 4. Jeremy Corbyn announced he will stand against Labour, his former party, as an independent candidate at the general election as he tries to hold onto his seat of Islington North. Nigel Farage said Rishi Sunak’s decision to call an early general election on July 4 had “wrong footed” him by torpedoing his plans to run for parliament.                      24 May 2024-07:13PM GMT                                         ‘Michael’s reforms to education are what I’m most proud of’                    A deputy Conservative Party chairman has hailed Michael Gove’s education reforms as the Conservatives’ best achievement while in office. Writing on X, formerly Twitter, Jonathan Gullis said: “Michael’s reforms to education are what I’m most proud of since we came to power in 2010. “They have undoubtedly raised standards and improved the life chances of many pupils. “I’ll also forever be grateful for his bravery in co-leading Vote Leave, and delivering Brexit!”                      24 May 2024-06:58PM GMT                                         Keir Starmer’s plan for a decade in power: ‘I find it easy to be ruthless’                    Over the last two months, The Telegraph has been given access to the Labour leader and his inner circle to try to answer that question. Away from simple policy slogans, where do Sir Keir’s instincts really lie? What type of leader is he? What motivates him? And what about when the cameras are switched off? After Mr Sunak’s shock general election announcement on Wednesday, time is running out to understand the man who may well be leading the country in just six weeks. His determination, members of Team Keir concur, is critical to understanding the success of his leadership to date. It can be hard to recall, in a year when Labour has become accustomed to 20 percentage point leads over the Tories, how precarious the political situation was when Sir Keir took over the party’s leadership in April 2020.

The Liberal Democrats won 48 per cent of the vote, while the Tories picked up 40 per cent and Labour five per cent.                      24 May 2024-06:54PM GMT                                         Katharine Birbalsingh: Gove was the greatest education secretary we ever will have                    Katharine Birbalsingh, known as Britain’s strictest head teacher, has said Michael Gove was the “greatest education secretary we have ever had and ever will have”: Michael Gove @michaelgove  was the greatest Education Secretary we have ever had and ever will have.Did he make mistakes?

A spokesman for Sky said: “Sky News is delighted that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has agreed to travel to Grimsby and answer voters questions in a Sky News leader’s special event. “Negotiations are ongoing for Rishi Sunak to attend.” Grimsby was won by the Conservatives for the first time since the Second World War in 2019 and is seen as a bellwether seat in the July 4 contest. Last night, Mr Sunak claimed that Sir Keir does not have the “courage” to face him in a televised election debate because he does not have a plan for the country.                      24 May 2024-06:34PM GMT                                         Gove ‘running scared’ of us, say Liberal Democrats                    The Liberal Democrats claimed tonight that Michael Gove is “running scared” of their party. Mr Gove was expected to retain his Surrey Heath constituency by one percentage point, with the Liberal Democrats projected to win 32 per cent of the vote to the Tories’ 33 per cent. It is part of Sir Ed Davey’s strategy to target dozens of ‘Blue Wall’ seats in traditional true blue Tory heartlands. Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: “Conservative politicians are fleeing the blue wall in their droves. Michael Gove is running scared of the Liberal Democrats. “The drumbeat of Conservative MPs stepping down has been getting louder as the days go by-now it’s deafening.  “Every Conservative MP that steps down in a blue wall battleground is a damning statement against Rishi Sunak and proof the Liberal Democrats are on the up.”                      24 May 2024-06:33PM GMT                                         Good evening                                         Dominic Penna here, The Telegraph’s Political Correspondent, guiding you through a dramatic evening in Westminster.                      24 May 2024-06:30PM GMT                                         77 Tory MPs stepping down                    Michael Gove has become the 77th, and most high-profile, MP to stand down at the election, surpassing the previous record of 72 who quit prior to Tony Blair’s 1997 landslide win for Labour. Former ministers Sir David Evennett, Greg Clark and Sir John Redwood, and Craig Mackinlay, who returned to the House of Commons this week after his sepsis ordeal, were also among those to confirm they are not running. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to call a summer election surprised many in Westminster, who had been expecting an autumn poll. The news has reportedly caused disquiet among some Tory MPs fearful of losing their jobs, and newspaper reports have suggested Cabinet ministers voiced concerns about the decision.                      24 May 2024-06:24PM GMT                                         Gove: ‘I have undoubtedly made mistakes’                    Michael Gove, in a letter to the chairman of Surrey Heath Conservatives, conceded he “undoubtedly made mistakes” throughout his political career but said he had always “tried to be a voice for those who have been overlooked and undervalued”. “I have tried to fight for greater social justice. My education reforms were designed to build a country where everyone-no matter their background-can become the authors of their own life stories. “For me that is what being in Parliament and being in government is all about.”                      24 May 2024-06:16PM GMT                                         Gove pays tribute to former PMs                    In a letter to the chairman of the Surrey Heath Conservatives attached to the post, he said: “Thank you for your kindness earlier. As we discussed, I have decided today not to seek to represent Surrey Heath at the forthcoming General Election. “Having the chance to serve as a Member of Parliament and Minister has been a profound privilege. As a child in Aberdeen I could never have imagined I would have the opportunity to sit in the Commons, let alone around the Cabinet table. “My parents, who adopted me when I was four months old, brought me up to believe that the chance to help others is the greatest gift you can be given. “That four Prime Ministers asked me to serve the country in their Governments has been the honour of my life. “I am grateful to them all: David Cameron who gave me the chance to pursue the education reforms in which I passionately believe, Theresa May who asked me to support her in challenging times, Boris Johnson who delivered Brexit and set out the levelling up vision which is so important for our country, and Rishi Sunak who asked me to return to Government when I believed my ministerial career had ended, enabling me to deepen and intensify the levelling up programme. “His support has ensured we can deliver projects which are benefitting towns and communities in all parts of the country. Having seen up close the demands of the role I know we all owe them so much.”                      24 May 2024-06:10PM GMT                                         Gove steps down as MP                    Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, has stepped down as MP of Surrey Heath.  In a letter posted on Twitter, formerly X, he wrote: “I also know the toll office can take, as do those closest to me.  “No-one in politics is a conscript.

The Bill increases the standard lease for homes and flats to 990 years, removes the marriage value towards the end of the lease, makes buying or selling a leasehold property quicker and easier, requires transparency over service charges and administration fees and scraps the presumption for leaseholders to pay their freeholders’ legal costs when challenging poor practice. Landlords holding the freehold on properties are concerned over aspects of the Bill which they claim could not only penalise them but also damage the interests of leaseholders. Conservative peer Lord Moylan led the rebellion with a demand that the Government drop the Bill or delay the proroguing of Parliament to allow full consideration of the legislation next week, tabling amendments that could push its consideration back. He said: “This seems to me, for a complex and difficult piece of legislation about which many serious questions were raised in Committee, a most reckless way of proceeding... This is being rushed through in the most reckless fashion.”                      24 May 2024-05:38PM GMT                                         Private school parents pull children out as Starmer vows to launch tax raid ‘straight away’                    Parents are pulling children out of private school after Sir Keir Starmer promised a tax raid on “day one” of a Labour government.  Headteachers have told The Telegraph that parents are already cancelling places for September amid fears Labour will be in power before the start of the school holidays. Others are rushing to pay fees in advance, following news that the poll will be held on July 4 rather than in the autumn as previously expected.

The MP for Beckenham in south-east London made the comments to Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, 37, in a row outside the Foreign Office’s Lancaster House in Westminster in 2023. Then a Conservative MP, Mr Stewart resigned the whip after he was convicted last November for a racially aggravated public order offence in relation to the incident. The conviction was overturned at Southwark Crown Court in February this year after it determined that although the comments were abusive, the upset they caused Mr Alwadaei did not amount to “harassment, alarm or distress”. On Friday, it was announced that Mr Stewart would have the Tory whip restored. Reacting to the decision, Mr Al-Wadaei, who fled Bahrain in 2012 after being tortured by the authorities, said: “It’s shameful to see the whip getting restored to him. “It gives a clear message that the Conservative Party will reward abusive comments by their MPs.”                      24 May 2024-05:07PM GMT                                         John Swinney ‘very confident’ of SNP’s fortunes in election                    John Swinney has said he is “very confident” the SNP can hold its Edinburgh seats and make gains at the General Election.  The SNP hold three of Edinburgh’s five constituencies, with the Lib Dems and Labour holding one each. Mr Swinney also stressed that he would stay on as leader of the SNP even if his party performs poorly, saying “of course, I’m just in the door”. The veteran parliamentarian became leader of the SNP less than three weeks ago, beginning his second period at the head of the party. Speaking to journalists during a visit to Leith, he said: “The SNP has got a great team in the city of Edinburgh. I’m very confident that we will hold on to our seats that are held by Deidre Brock, by Joanna Cherry and by Tommy Shepherd. And I’m also very confident that the SNP can make gains in this election.                      24 May 2024-04:57PM GMT                                         Corbyn’s days of having a say in Labour are over, says Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer has boasted that Jeremy Corbyn’s days of having a say in Labour are “over”. The Labour leader was speaking after Mr Corbyn was stripped of party membership following his predecessor’s announcement that he would stand as an independent candidate at the next election. “Jeremy Corbyn’s days of commenting on what Labour is doing are over,” Sir Keir told reporters in Leyland, Lancashire. Mr Corbyn will stand in Islington North on July 4, the seat he has held since 1983.                      24 May 2024-04:44PM GMT                                         Starmer: ‘I won’t debate Sunak because I know what he’ll say’                    Sir Keir Starmer has claimed he does not want to debate Rishi Sunak more because “I know what he’s going to say”. The Labour leader has so far declined to take up the Prime Minister’s offer of a debate very week during the election campaign. Asked if he would debate Mr Sunak on The Sun’s YouTube channel, he told reporters in Leyland, Lancashire: “The problem with head to heads with Rishi Sunak is I know what he’s going to say. “He’s going to say, ‘Everything’s fine’. “Now that may be true that it’s fine for him, but it isn’t fine for Sun readers. So we’ve heard that discussion. “I would actually prefer — it’s why I’ve actually spent quite a bit of time with the workers here — I prefer to engage directly with the voters, directly with Sun readers. “Now there will be some debates. That’s part of the tradition of the elections. But I think it’s much more important to to debate directly with your readers.”                       24 May 2024-04:33PM GMT                                         Starmer: ‘I could still lose the election’                    Sir Keir Starmer has said he could still lose the election. Asked if Rishi Sunak’s start to the campaign made a Labour victory inevitable, he said: “I have to say the spectacle of Prime Minister standing in the pouring rain without an umbrella, pretending that he’s the only person in the country with a plan is, how should I say it, farcical.” He added: “I hope people vote for the change I think is desperately needed. But I’m humble. “I know we’ve got to earn every vote and the polls don’t predict the future. “We’re making a positive case. We’re pleased that the election has been called because I think the country needs it. The country’s crying out for it. And we will continue to campaign positively.”                      24 May 2024-04:31PM GMT                                         Tuition fees unlikely to lower under Labour, Starmer suggests                    Sir Keir Starmer has suggested tuition fees are unlikely to lower under Labour.  He told reporters on a visit to Leyland, Lancashire: “There are options that we need to look at. But I think the current arrangements are unfair. I think they’re unfair on students. I think they’re unfair on universities. “There is you know, there’s an argument for abolishing tuition fees, but after the damage that Liz Truss did to the economy, we can’t afford to abolish tuition fees and do what we need to do for the NHS. “So the political choice I’ve made is to prioritise the NHS. I think that’s the right choice. The electorate will decide on the Fourth of July but I think most people would say, when you can’t have both, the NHS has to take priority.”                      24 May 2024-04:14PM GMT                                         Sunak grilled over support for childcare sector                    A nursery owner said she was inclined to vote Labour after questioning Rishi Sunak about support for the childcare sector. Jennifer Hughes, owner of the Bluebell Hill Nursery in Cannock, Staffordshire, challenged the Prime Minister on a campaign visit to the area, asking how he would help early years education providers that could not cover their costs with the funding available. She explained that she ran at a deficit of £2 per child, with 75% of her funding coming from the local authority and a rising minimum wage adding to her costs. Mr Sunak said it was “interesting” that Government rates were not enough to cover her costs, adding: “The department did a survey and what they found is that the rates that the Government is now paying, because we’ve increased them, are actually higher than they were in the private sector.” Ms Hughes and Mr Sunak had their exchange during a question and answer session at South Staffordshire College, the Prime Minister’s final stop on his two-day campaigning tour of all four nations of the UK. Ms Hughes said she did not feel satisfied with Mr Sunak’s response, commenting “I would be inclined to vote Labour after that answer.”                      24 May 2024-04:06PM GMT                                         DUP announces new candidate for Jeffrey Donaldson’s seat following sex charges                    The DUP has announced that Jonathan Buckley will be its candidate in the Lagan Valley constituency at the General Election-the seat currently held by former party leader Jeffrey Donaldson. Donaldson’s lawyer announced this week that he would not be seeking re-election after he was charged with a number of historical sex offences. He denies the offences. Mr Buckley is currently a party MLA in the Upper Bann constituency. Making the announcement in Belfast, interim party leader Gavin Robinson said: “With recent changes in Lagan Valley boundaries, almost 7,000 who were formerly in his Upper Bann constituency have now moved to Lagan Valley. Jonathan has strong links, including through family to the Lisburn and wider Lagan Valley area.” Mr Robinson described Mr Buckley as the “next generation advocate” for unionist voters in Lagan Valley. He said Lagan Valley MLAs Emma Little-Pengelly and Paul Givan would continue in their roles as deputy First Minister and Education Minister The party also announced that Belfast City councillor Tracy Kelly would be the candidate in the Belfast South and Mid Down constituency.                      24 May 2024-03:57PM GMT                                         Keir Starmer challenged on commitment armed forces                    Sir Keir Starmer is speaking on a visit to C&W Berry, a builders’ yard in Leyland, Lancs., reports Tim Sigsworth. The Labour leader is here to talk about his party’s green prosperity plan and industrial policies. He was challenged on his commitment to the armed forces during the visit.  He said: “We do need to get our defence budget up to 2.5 per cent.” He added that he would do a “very quick strategic review” upon taking office. Sir Keir did not commit to a time frame to reach 2.5 per cent of GDP being spent on defence.                      24 May 2024-03:41PM GMT                                         Ruth Davidson pours scorn on Sunak’s campaign                    Baroness Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, has mocked Rishi Sunak’s election campaign, asking if there is a “double agent” inside the Tory party’s headquarters.

The Prime Minister told GB News: “David Frost has not been blocked from standing as a candidate at the election in July.

The former leader of the Scottish Conservatives pointed to Rishi Sunak getting drenched in Downing Street and his visit to the Titanic Quarter in Belfast as evidence that things had not started well.

Mr Sunak told GB News: “With regard to Craig as I said in Parliament on Wednesday he is just an enormous inspiration.  “For him to have gone through what he has gone through, and as everyone can see, to just have the positivity and energy that he has brought to life is nothing short of inspiring. “Whenever I am having difficult days I just think about what he has been through and the courage and resilience he has shown, all of us can take something from that and be inspired.”                      24 May 2024-01:55PM GMT                                         Starmer: No deals with SNP ‘under any circumstances’                    Sir Keir Starmer has categorically ruled out a deal with the SNP in “any circumstances” after July’s general election, insisting there was “no way” his party could work with Scottish nationalists. Sir Keir was adamant he would not work with the SNP, even if the July 4 contest failed to result in an overall majority for Labour. Asked if he could work with John Swinney’s party in the event of a hung parliament, Sir Keir made clear there would be “absolutely no deal with the SNP”. He said there would “obviously” be no deal in advance of the election but added there would be “no deal the other side of the election, under any circumstances”. The Labour leader added: “That’s not just a question of mathematics, that is because there is no way an incoming Labour government could ever work in any way with the SNP, whose only ambition is to break up the United Kingdom.”                      24 May 2024-01:45PM GMT                                         Lord Watson pokes fun at Tory campaign after Sunak visits Titanic Quarter                    Lord Watson, the former deputy leader of the Labour Party, has poked fun at the Tory election campaign after Rishi Sunak paid a visit to the Titanic Quarter in Belfast today.  Mr Sunak was interviewed by a reporter who asked the Prime Minister: “We are just yards away from where the Titanic was built and designed. Are you captaining a sinking ship going into this election?”  Mr Sunak replied: “If you look at what has happened over the past few weeks alone you can see that our plan is working.”  It prompted Lord Watson to recount a story about the 1997 general election campaign when Sir Tony Blair was put on a train called “mission impossible”:  I helped organise a Tony Blair visit in 1997 and put him on a train named "mission impossible."

Asked if the fact that 75 Tory MPs were calling it quits was a matter of concern, the Defence Secretary told Sky News: “I don’t think it is actually all that unusual. You often get a lot standing down at election time.”  He added: “You often get this illusion that there are more standing down from the governing side and of course the good reason for that is there are by definition more MPs on the governing side.”                      24 May 2024-01:20PM GMT                                         Pictured: Sunak arrives at Birmingham Airport after trip to Northern Ireland                                         24 May 2024-01:07PM GMT                                         Labour made ‘error’ by failing to restore whip to Corbyn, says union boss                    Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, suggested Labour had made an “error” by failing to restore the party whip to Jeremy Corbyn.  Asked how she felt about Mr Corbyn running as an independent candidate in Islington North, Ms Graham told the BBC Radio 4 World At One programme: “I think Labour should have taken the opportunity to bring people together.

Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, said she wanted specific answers from Labour on how it would ensure fossil fuel jobs are replaced with green energy ones.  She told the BBC Radio 4 World At One programme: “I think the important thing is that my job is to defend workers, that is the job that I have, and I think in this election the workers’ voice must absolutely be heard.  “We can’t have the oil and gas workers becoming the coal miners of our generation.”  Ms Graham said that the promise of “jam tomorrow is not going to cut it”.                      24 May 2024-12:43PM GMT                                         Labour selects candidate to take on Corbyn in Islington North                    Labour has selected Praful Nargund as its candidate to take on Jeremy Corbyn in Islington North at the general election.  Mr Nargund is a Labour councillor on Islington Council. Mr Corbyn announced this morning that he will contest the election as an independent candidate as he tries to hold onto the seat he has represented since 1983.

Claire Coutinho, the Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary, said: “Sir Keir Starmer stood in Scotland and hailed his cave-in to Angela Rayner and the unions 70 new French-style regulations that would ban flexible working, but failed to say anything about the 93,000 jobs in Scotland that would be lost as a result of Labour’s reckless pledge to shut down our oil and gas sector. “Labour have no plan to get bills down for families – instead they would take us back to square one by making voters pay more for net zero and hiking up taxes by £2,094 for every hardworking family.” “Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will stick to a clear plan and take bold action to secure our future energy security and protect British jobs.”                      24 May 2024-12:05PM GMT                                         Pictured: Jeremy Hunt campaigns in the village of Compton in Surrey today                                         24 May 2024-11:52AM GMT                                         Tories now one shy of 1997 record for number of MPs quitting                    Craig Mackinlay’s decision not to seek re-election on July 4 ( see the post below at 12.41) takes the total number of Tory MPs quitting to 74.  That is one shy of the 1997 record for Conservatives standing down of 75.                       24 May 2024-11:41AM GMT                                         Craig Mackinlay to quit at general election                    Craig Mackinlay, the Tory MP who lost his arms and legs to sepsis, will not contest the general election on July 4.  Mr Mackinlay, the MP for South Thanet, returned to Westminster on Wednesday this week and was given a standing ovation and a round of applause from his parliamentary colleagues when he entered the House of Commons at the start of PMQs.  But in a statement issued to GB News, Mr Mackinlay said:  “Whilst my heart tells me to stand again, there being so much unfinished business across local regeneration and national issues which are important to me, my head knows this to be impossible at this time.  “It would be difficult to withstand the rigours of an all-out election campaign, a campaign that I’d always wish to lead from the front. Thereafter, upon being re-elected it would be difficult for me to sustain 70 to 80 hour working weeks which were the norm prior to my illness.  “I had hoped to phase my return to the House of Commons over the coming months as my abilities improved. Since leaving in-patient rehabilitation a month ago my life now revolves around various medical appointments.  “I face numerous future operations as a result of the serious sepsis that I suffered which very nearly took my life. I have only just started the prosthetic journey and I have weekly physiotherapy and occupational therapy sessions.”                      24 May 2024-11:33AM GMT                                         Parliament agrees to extend pub licensing hours for Euros                    An order to extend licensing hours during the Euros football tournament, that will enable “people to get properly on the lash”, has passed through the House of Lords and is ready for royal assent. The order to the Licensing Act 2003 (Uefa European Football Championship Licensing Hours) will extend sales of alcohol if either England or Scotland reach the semi-final or the final of the Euros, meaning premises will be allowed to remain open until 1am without having to notify the licensing authority. Conservative peer Lord Sharpe of Epsom told the Lords: “So much of the business at the Home Office is difficult, so it gives me particular pleasure that my last outing basically enables people to get properly on the lash. “My Lords, please drink responsibly.”                      24 May 2024-11:18AM GMT                                         Father of the House of Commons will seek re-election                    Sir Peter Bottomley, the Father of the House of Commons, has confirmed he will be standing for re-election aged 79, writes Dominic Penna. Sir Peter holds the title of Father of the House because he has the longest continuous service in the Commons, representing three constituencies since his first successful election in 1975. Victory at the general election on July 4 in his constituency of Worthing West, where he won a majority of almost 15,000 in 2019, would take his time in Parliament past the 50-year mark. It would be his 13th general election win a row.  Sir Peter told the Telegraph: “I’ve been selected for my revised constituency. If there’s a tsunami I might drown, but if I can float then I’ll walk on water.”                      24 May 2024-11:03AM GMT                                         Labour puzzled by Tory TV debate calls given weekly clashes at PMQs                    It is fair to say that some Labour insiders have been left slightly puzzled by the ferocity of the Tory attacks on Sir Keir Starmer over the TV debates issue.  One source told The Telegraph: “They debate once a week [at PMQs] and have done for two years.”                      24 May 2024-10:57AM GMT                                         Lib Dems ‘determined to beat’ as many Tory MPs as possible, says Davey                    Sir Ed Davey claimed the Conservatives are “running scared” of the Liberal Democrats as he spoke to supporters in Eastbourne today. The party leader said Sir John Redwood announcing this morning that he would stand down as the Tory MP for Wokingham was a sign the Lib Dems will win in the constituency and “we will win here”. He added on battleground constituencies in the south of England: “Everybody knows now that if you want to beat the Conservatives, you vote Liberal Democrat. We are determined to beat as many Conservative MPs as we possibly can.”                      24 May 2024-10:44AM GMT                                         Lib Dems pledge to give people right to see GP within seven days                    Sir Ed Davey has unveiled plans to give patients a right to see a GP in seven days. The leader of the Liberal Democrats announced the pledge on a visit to Eastbourne this morning, a target constituency for the party. The Lib Dems came second behind Conservative MP Caroline Ansell in 2019.  Speaking at Eastbourne Pier, the party leader said: “So many people tell us they can’t get a GP appointment in the time they want. “They’re having to wait days and weeks in some cases. We’re so excited that we’re coming forward with new ideas about how we can transform our health system that will really help people struggling at the moment.”                      24 May 2024-10:41AM GMT                                         Lord Frost barred from standing as Tory candidate at election                    Lord Frost has been barred from standing as a Conservative Party candidate at the general election, The Telegraph understands.  There had been speculation that the former Brexit minister could resign from the House of Lords in order to fight for a seat in the House of Commons on July 4.  But Lord Frost has been told he cannot apply to be the Tory candidate in any of the seats where there is a vacancy.                      24 May 2024-10:33AM GMT                                         Pictured: Sunak visits Belfast during his two-day UK tour                                         24 May 2024-10:30AM GMT                                         Sunak ‘disappointed’ flagship smoking ban has been shelved                    Rishi Sunak said he was “disappointed” his flagship Bill banning young people from ever being able to smoke tobacco legally will not pass before Parliament shuts down today ahead of the general election. The Prime Minister’s Tobacco and Vapes Bill – which would have phased out smoking for anyone born after 2009-has been axed after Parliament ran out of time to pass it before its dissolution.  Speaking in Belfast, Mr Sunak said: “There’s always a normal process at the end of a Parliament to see which legislation you can pass in the time that’s available. “I’m pleased that yesterday we got the Horizon Bill through to make sure that we can deliver compensation and justice to the postmasters that were so badly impacted by what I described as one of the worst miscarriages of justice that we’ve ever known. “Today we’ll be debating the Bills that will ensure that the compensation authority for those impacted by the infected blood scandal get the justice that they deserve. So we are making progress. “And the smoking ban – of course disappointed to not be able to get that through at the end of the session given the time available. “But what I’d say is that’s evidence of the bold action that I’m prepared to take. That’s the type of Prime Minister I am. That’s the type of leadership that I bring.”                      24 May 2024-10:23AM GMT                                         PM signals door is open to Boris Johnson to campaign for Tories                    Rishi Sunak signalled the door is open for Boris Johnson to campaign for the Tories in the run up to July 4.  Speaking in Belfast as part of his whirlwind campaign tour of the UK, the Prime Minister said he would welcome “any Conservative to come and join the campaign” and that he has “been in touch with Boris in the past and I said I’m very proud of the work that we did together”. Mr Sunak told broadcasters: “I’m very proud of the record of the Conservative Government over the last 14 years. And of course we haven’t got everything right and circumstances have been difficult, but there’s an enormous amount to be proud of. “And when it comes to Boris he was of course the person who got Brexit done, ensured we had the fastest vaccine rollout in Europe and was the first to make sure that we provided support to Ukraine. “And I think all Conservatives will want to join the campaign because all Conservatives are united in wanting to see a Conservative government at the next election, because it’s the Conservatives that have got a clear plan that we’re working towards.”                      24 May 2024-10:21AM GMT                                         Tory leader urges Starmer to ‘take up offer’ of TV debates                    Rishi Sunak repeated his wish to debate Sir Keir Starmer after accusing him of lacking the “courage” to take part in weekly televised debates during the election campaign. “Well, I heard this morning that he said he wanted to debate the British people rather than me,” the Prime Minister said during a visit to Northern Ireland. “I think what the British people want are answers – answers to the questions about what he would actually do if he became prime minister, and how much it’s going to cost them in higher taxes. “I think those are the answers that he should be providing. You know, for my part, I’m very happy to debate Keir Starmer so I can set out what I want to do for this country, taking bold action working towards a clear plan and delivering a secure future for everyone. “That’s the choice of this election. It’s either going to be Keir Starmer or me that’s Prime Minister on July 5, and he should want to debate me. I want to debate him and I hope that he takes up the offer.”                      24 May 2024-10:20AM GMT                                         Sunak: ‘Now is the right time to think about our future’                    Rishi Sunak said the fall in the energy price cap reported this morning showed that “our plan is working” and that “the economy has turned a corner”. On a campaign trip to Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister told broadcasters: “Inflation is now back to normal, wages have been rising faster than prices for almost a year and at the beginning of this year, the economy grew at a very healthy rate. “And that’s why now is the right time to think about our future. And what I’ll be talking to the British people about over the next few weeks is our bold action that we’re prepared to take, working to a clear plan that we can see as having real effects on people for the better. “And that’s why we can deliver a secure future for everyone in our country.”                      24 May 2024-10:06AM GMT                                         Pictured: Rayner launches Welsh Labour election campaign in Llandudno                                         24 May 2024-09:54AM GMT                                         UK must be prepared for ‘foreign interference’ during election                    Britain “must be prepared for the possibility of foreign interference” during the general election, Parliament’s joint committee on the national security strategy (JCNSS) has warned. In a letter addressed to Rishi Sunak, Dame Margaret Beckett, the committee’s chairman, said that the UK has experienced a “pattern of attempted foreign interference from countries such as China, Russia, Iran and North Korea” in recent years. The letter highlights that the National Cyber Security Centre noted in 2023 that the Government thought it was “almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the 2019 general election”.

He told activists in Glasgow: “Only Labour can stop the chaos and turn the page.” Sir Keir said that Scottish voters “now have that opportunity to kick the Tories out”. He argued that “there is no Labour without Scotland” and Scotland will be “central to the mission of the next Labour government”.  He said: “I know there are voters here in Scotland who wanted in the past to get the Tories out but felt that they couldn’t vote for Labour because they didn’t think that we would win.  “Well, we are a changed Labour Party and we now have that opportunity to kick the Tories out but you have to take that opportunity by voting Labour.  “Because there is no change without Scotland, there is no Labour without Scotland.

Sir Keir said that “Scotland’s voice is vital, absolutely vital” and “it needs to be a leading voice”.  He claimed that “sending a message” was the “height of the SNP’s ambition” in Westminster.  “I don’t want Scotland to send a message, I want Scotland to send a Labour government,” he said.                      24 May 2024-09:20AM GMT                                         Sarwar promises to ‘maximise Scotland’s influence’ in Westminster                    Anas Sarwar said that “people in Scotland want change both at Westminster and at Holyrood”. The Scottish Labour leader said the party will demonstrate in the coming weeks “what change means, why it matters and what difference it will make” to families across the country. Mr Sarwar said that during the general election campaign Labour will “demonstrate how we can maximise Scotland’s influence” at Westminster.                       24 May 2024-09:17AM GMT                                         Anas Sarwar: ‘UK is desperate for change’                    Anas Sarwar said Scotland and the rest of the UK was “desperate for change” as he launched Scottish Labour’s election campaign alongside Sir Keir Starmer in Glasgow.  Mr Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said: “The moment has finally arrived. Our country has been desperate for a general election and now it is upon us. “Scotland and the UK is deperate for change, crying out for change and Labour is ready to deliver it.”                      24 May 2024-09:03AM GMT                                         Starmer set to launch Scottish Labour election campaign                    Sir Keir Starmer is set to launch Scottish Labour’s general election campaign at an event in Glasgow shortly.

The Conservative Party posted an attack advert on Twitter this morning depicting the Labour leader as a children’s toy in a box, claiming that he “comes in every colour” and “he can be anything”.  The advert carried a warning that “Keir may change positions over time”.  Mr Sunak reposted the advert and said: “Not coming to a debate near you.” Not coming to a debate near you. https://t.co/Uvg1WPAyea                      24 May 2024-08:47AM GMT                                         Starmer’s ‘inane waffle’ makes case for TV debates, claims Tory chairman                    The chairman of the Conservative Party said Sir Keir Starmer’s “inane waffle” during his morning broadcast round had made the “strongest case possible” for holding TV debates.  Richard Holden claimed the Labour leader was “running scared” of debating Rishi Sunak.

Sir Keir suggested this morning that a Labour government would not increase taxes by any more than the party has already set out and public spending would not be cut either (see the post below at 07.48).  Sir Simon, the Tory former Cabinet minister, tweeted: “Good luck, as they say, with that.

Asked about the Prime Minister’s claims he was not willing to take part in so many debates, Sir Keir told Sky News: “He is sounding increasingly desperate, I have to say. “Of course there are going to be TV debates. They are part and parcel of the election cycle now. I obviously want to spend as much of my time talking to voters directly. “I could do a hundred debates with Rishi Sunak, but I know what he is going to say, he is going to say everything is fine, the cost of living crisis is over, the health service hasn’t got any problems.

It comes after Mr Corbyn announced this morning that he will stand as an independent candidate in Islington North.                       24 May 2024-08:26AM GMT                                         Starmer ‘too scared’ to face Sunak at TV debates, claims Coutinho                    Claire Coutinho claimed Sir Keir Starmer was “too scared” to face Rishi Sunak at televised general election debates.  The Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary said: “Sir Keir Starmer is too scared to debate the Prime Minister because he doesn’t have a plan and hasn’t got the courage to stand up and say what he believes in or to stand up for Britain. “The only thing we can be sure of with Labour is that their sums won’t add up-Starmer’s green promise is part of Labour’s £38.5 billion spending blackhole that would take working families back to square one with £2,094 of higher taxes to fill the gap. “Only Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives will take the practical approach with a clear plan and bold action to secure to Britain’s energy supply and keep bills low for families.”                      24 May 2024-08:11AM GMT                                         Labour will stand ‘excellent’ candidate against Corbyn, says Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer said Jeremy Corbyn’s choice to stand as an independent candidate in the general election is a matter for his predecessor. Sir Keir told BBC Breakfast that Labour will have an “excellent candidate” in Mr Corbyn’s Islington North seat.  He said: “Well, look, that’s a matter for Jeremy, he’s obviously made his mind up about that. We will have an excellent Labour candidate in Islington North, as we’ve got excellent Labour candidates across the country. “But in the end, this election is about a choice, a choice of five more years of the chaos and division that we’ve seen over the last 14 years or turning the page and rebuilding our country with Labour. “That is what’s on the ballot paper, whether it’s in Islington North or anywhere else across the country.”                      24 May 2024-08:05AM GMT                                         Sunak arrives in Northern Ireland for fourth leg of UK tour                    Rishi Sunak has arrived in Northern Ireland for the fourth leg of his whirlwind tour of the UK. The Prime Minister has already visited England, Wales and Scotland as he kicks off his general election campaign, and is expected to hold a further event in the Midlands later today.                      24 May 2024-08:03AM GMT                                         Tory MPs ‘running scared’ of Lib Dems, claims Daisy Cooper                    The Liberal Democrats claimed Sir John Redwood’s decision to stand down at the general election was further evidence of senior Tories “running scared” of the party. Sir John held the seat of Wokingham at the 2019 general election with a majority of just over 7,000 votes, with the Lib Dems in second place. It will be one of the party’s key targets on July 4.  Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dems’ deputy leader, said: “This is yet another Conservative big beast in the south of England who is now running scared.  “Wokingham is a key battleground where the Liberal Democrats are the clear challengers to the Conservatives. Right across the ‘Blue Wall’ Conservative MPs are standing down in their droves and it’s because they’re worried about losing their seats to the Liberal Democrats.”                      24 May 2024-07:59AM GMT                                         Miliband blasts Tories over household energy bills                    Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, claimed that “only Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives could look at energy bills still being hundreds of pounds a year higher for families and call it good news” as he responded to Ofgem’s announcement on the price cap (see the post below at 08.02). The Labour frontbencher said: “This Government is totally out of touch with the cost of living crisis families face. The British people know that they are paying the price for 14 years of failed Conservative energy policy. “If the Tories get back in, Britain will remain vulnerable to dictators like Putin, and family finances will continue to be rocked by sky-high energy bills. “A Labour government will cut bills by setting up Great British Energy, a new publicly-owned company to invest in homegrown clean energy so we can boost energy independence and cut bills for good. It’s time to stop the chaos, turn the page and start to rebuild.”                      24 May 2024-07:53AM GMT                                         Tax on private school fees will be rolled out ‘straight away’, says Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer said he would roll out Labour’s plan to impose VAT on private school fees “straight away” if the party wins the general election.  Asked if the plan would be implemented on “day one” of being in power, Sir Keir told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “As soon as it can be done. Obviously there will have to be financial statements etc. “It is a question of the timetable in Parliament. But these first steps are intended to be done straight away.”                      24 May 2024-07:44AM GMT                                         Starmer says Palestine should be recognised as a state but won’t be drawn on timing                    Sir Keir Starmer said Palestine should be recognised as a state but he would not give a timeline on when a Labour government would do so.  He said it should only happen at the “right time in the process”.  Asked if he thought Palestine should be a state, Sir Keir told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Yes, I do and I think recognition of Palestine is extremely important. We need a viable Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel and recognition has to be part of that.”  Sir Keir said that recognition “has to come at an appropriate, the right time in the process, but I absolutely believe in it”.                       24 May 2024-07:31AM GMT                                         Starmer: Labour could not abolish House of Lords ‘straight away’                    Sir Keir Starmer insisted he does still want to abolish the House of Lords but a Labour government could not do it “straight away”.  He said Labour would have to “prioritise” if it wins the general election.                      24 May 2024-07:27AM GMT                                         Labour government could not afford to scrap two-child benefits limit, says Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer said a Labour government could not afford to scrap the two-child limit on benefit payments.  Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, has been leading calls to scrap the limit.  Asked if he wanted to scrap the cap, Sir Keir told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that “in an ideal world, of course, but we haven’t got the resources to do it at the moment”.                      24 May 2024-07:22AM GMT                                         Starmer rules out resurrecting pledge to scrap tuition fees                    Sir Keir Starmer said he will not be resurrecting his old pledge to scrap university tuition fees.  He pledged to abolish fees in his 2020 leadership campaign but ditched the commitment last year, blaming the state of the public finances.  Asked this morning if he still believed in free university tuition, the Labour leader told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that he “certainly believe that we have got to change the current arrangements because I don’t think they are fair”.  Asked if he could bring the pledge back if he delivers the economic growth he is targeting, Sir Keir said Labour will only make general election pledges “that we know we can fulfill”.  He said he had chosen to put more money into the NHS rather than scrapping tuition fees, arguing that “we can’t do both”.                       24 May 2024-07:14AM GMT                                         Starmer denies ‘dodging’ TV debates with Sunak                    Sir Keir Starmer denied he was dodging debates with the Prime Minister, after Rishi Sunak challenged the Labour leader to weekly head-to-heads on television. He told LBC: “No, we are not dodging. TV debates are a big part of election campaigns and there will be debates in these elections.” Sir Keir said he would face the Prime Minister in debates, but was more interested in speaking to voters directly as “the arguments are going to be exactly the same because we do them every Wednesday at Prime Minister’s Questions”. Asked about Mr Sunak’s claim that Labour’s immigration policy was a form of blanket asylum, Sir Keir said: “That is as daft as he looked standing in the rain without an umbrella.”                      24 May 2024-07:11AM GMT                                         Diane Abbott investigation will conclude before election, says Starmer                    A Labour investigation into veteran MP Diane Abbott will be resolved before the general election, Sir Keir Starmer has said. Asked about the probe, the Labour leader told LBC: “It will be resolved, yes of course it will. We have got a cut-off date for, I think it is June 4, or thereabouts. So we have got a date in place.” Pressed about whether the Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP who currently sits as an independent, would have the Labour whip restored, Sir Keir said: “That is a process we are going through. The National Executive Committee in the end will decide that. “But we have got a process in place and we will complete it reasonably soon now.”                      24 May 2024-07:03AM GMT                                         Jeremy Corbyn announces he will run as independent candidate against Labour                    Jeremy Corbyn has announced he will stand as an independent candidate at the general election as he tries to hold onto his seat of Islington North.  The former Labour leader urged his supporters to help him “prove that when we come together, we can win”.  Mr Corbyn’s decision represents a major headache for Sir Keir Starmer and will risk exacerbating splits between the Labour leadership and the Left wing of the party. Mr Corbyn has represented the constituency since 1983.  The Telegraph revealed yesterday  that Mr Corbyn was going to run against Labour. I am standing as an independent candidate for the people of Islington North.

The regulator announced it is dropping its price cap from the current £1,690 for a typical dual fuel household in England, Scotland and Wales to £1,568, a drop of £122 over the course of a year. This is around £500 less than the cap in July last year, when it was £2,074. Claire Countinho, the Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary, welcomed the change and said the UK had “turned a corner”.  Energy bills are coming down by another £122-bringing the total fall this year to almost £400.I know the last few years have been a struggle, but we have turned a corner.

That is more Tories quitting than at any point since Labour’s landslide victory in 1997. The 1997 record was 75 Conservative MPs standing down.                       24 May 2024-06:51AM GMT                                         Sir John Redwood to stand down as Tory MP                    Sir John Redwood has announced he will not be standing at the general election, joining a growing Tory exodus.  In a statement published on his website this morning, the former Cabinet minister said: “I have decided not to put my name forward in the forthcoming election. I have other things I wish to do.” Sir John has represented the Wokingham constituency since 1987.                       24 May 2024-06:48AM GMT                                         No additional tax rises or spending cuts under Labour government, Starmer suggests                    Sir Keir Starmer suggested a Labour government would not increase taxes by any more than the party has already set out and public spending would not be cut either.  The Labour leader stressed during an interview on Times Radio that delivering greater economic growth would be key to funding the party’s policy plans.  Asked if he was committing to no tax rises and no spending cuts, Sir Keir said: “Where there are tax rises, we have set out what they will be and what the money will be spent on.  “So we will get rid of the non-dom status properly, we will go after those that avoid their tax and we will use that money to fund 40,000 extra appointments in the NHS every week to bring down that backlog.  “Because that in itself, having so many people, the waiting list is now nearly 8 million, that in itself is a drag anchor on the economy.”  Asked again if he was committing to no additional tax rises and no spending cuts, he replied: “To be clear, where there are tax rises we have set that out and we have also set out what the money will be used for.”                      24 May 2024-06:37AM GMT                                         Sir Ed Davey: Lib Dems ‘would slash energy bills’                    Sir Ed Davey said the Liberal Democrats would slash energy bills by investing in home insulation and boosting renewables. The leader was responding to the new Ofgem price cap as he set out his party’s election offer on energy. Sir Ed said: “Energy bills remain far higher than five years ago, on top of sky-high mortgages and rents and prices in the shops. “Families and pensioners are feeling worse off after years of Conservative chaos. “Liberal Democrats would slash energy bills by investing in insulating people’s homes and boosting renewables – the cheapest, cleanest and most popular form of energy.”                      24 May 2024-06:35AM GMT                                         Starmer refuses to commit to six debates with Sunak                    Sir Keir Starmer refused to commit to a Tory challenge to take part in six general election TV debates with Rishi Sunak in the run up to July 4.  The Labour leader said televised debates “are always a part of an election campaign and no doubt will be a big part of what is going to happen over the next five or six weeks”.  But he would not be drawn on specific plans. Rishi Sunak has claimed Sir Keir does not have the “courage” to face him.   Asked if he would be willing to take part in a debate hosted by Times Radio and if he would be willing to take part in six in total-one a week-as the Tories have suggested, Sir Keir replied: “Well look, I am as keen to debate with voters, I want to get my message to the voters.  “So I think debates are always a part of an election campaign and no doubt will be a big part of what is going to happen over the next five or six weeks.”  Asked again if he would take part in a debate hosted by Times Radio, the Labour leader said: “Look, I will debate with voters any day of the week.”                      24 May 2024-06:24AM GMT                                         Starmer: Economic growth is the ‘missing ingredient’                    Sir Keir Starmer said that economic growth was the “missing ingredient”.  It was suggested to Sir Keir that a Labour government would have to choose between tax rises and spending cuts to fund its plans given the state of the public finances.  But he suggested economic growth would provide an alternative to those two options.  He told Times Radio he had “set out in clear terms all of the commitments that we make, that we hope we can undertake as an incoming Labour government”.  He said Labour has “absolutely set as our priority economic growth” and that is the “missing ingredient”.                      24 May 2024-06:16AM GMT                                         General election diary: What is happening today?                    Sir Keir Starmer is on the morning media round and is due to do interviews with the major broadcasters.

Rishi Sunak is expected to visit Northern Ireland on the second day of his whirlwind tour of the UK.  Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, will be doing visits on the south coast of England.  The Scottish Greens are expected to launch their campaign later today.

The honorary president of Reform UK announced yesterday morning that he would not be standing to be an MP.  But he later revealed that he had been planning to announce he was standing next week but his plans were torpedoed by Mr Sunak’s announcement.  Mr Farage told GB News: “If the Tories think it’s great Nigel’s not standing, they’re wrong. I’m going to be involved in this campaign absolutely. “What I could not do in the space of six weeks, and yes, all right, he’s wrong footed me, but in the space of six weeks was to find a constituency from scratch, and go round the country. “I’m utterly committed to Reform. I believe their agenda is the only one that can actually stop the sense of national decline that we’re in.”                      24 May 2024-06:11AM GMT                                         Starmer ‘most definitely is not boring’, insists Labour frontbencher                    Sir Keir Starmer “most definitely is not boring”, a Labour frontbencher has insisted as he rejected claims the party’s general election campaign had got off to a slow start.  Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow minister without portfolio, said Sir Keir was “witty” and “great company” as well as being a “serious politician”.  It was suggested to Mr Thomas-Symonds that Sir Keir was intentionally looking to run a “boring campaign” in order to win the contest on July 4 “by default” after a launch event in Gillingham yesterday failed to make major waves.  But he told GB News: “No, I think that is a complete mischaracterisation of it. That is wrong. First of all, by the way, Keir Starmer most definitely is not boring.  “I’ve known Keir Starmer for many, many years. He’s witty, great company, but he’s also, by the way, a serious politician for the very serious challenges of our time.” Load-Date: May 25, 2024  End of Document
