   I am not hostile to private healthcare users, Keir Starmer insists telegraph.co.uk June 14, 2024 Friday 9:50 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 14584 words Byline: By Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor and Timothy Sigsworth and Daniel Martin, Deputy Political Editor Body   Sir Keir Starmer has insisted he is “not hostile” to private health care users, despite saying he would not pay for treatment for himself or for a relative in need of life-saving care. In an interview with Nick Robinson for BBC Panorama, the Labour leader said he could “completely understand why people would go private” and knew patients who had done so in order to “get back to work”. But he said he still considered theNHS the “very best place”  for people who needed acute care, including himself and his family. Sir Keir also said he was willing to make enemies over his plans to radically reform the planning system and confirmedhe would send British troops into battle if required , insisting he was ready to take “whatever action” needed to defend the UK. Pressed for his views on those who used private health care, having said he would not use the service himself, or even for a relative in need of life-saving care, Sir Keir denied that he was hostile towards patients who took that route. Asked if he considered them “queue jumpers”, he said: “I’m not hostile in the slightest. I completely understand why people would go private. “I know people who have because they wanted to have an operation more quickly, to get back to work or get back to something else.” But he doubled down on his previous comments, adding: “The NHS is the single best place if you’ve got an acute problem and that is why even in private hospitals, they refer into the NHS for acute care. If I had an acute care, life-threatening issue for me or my family, the very best place to be is in the NHS.” It comes after he admitted he uses a private dentist  because he is not eligible for NHS care.                      ‘We cannot go on like this’                    Sir Keir also said he was willing to fall out with people over his planning reforms, if that was what it took to get the economy growing. Asked if was prepared to make enemies, he said: “Yes, we’re going to have to be tough, we’re going to have to change the way things are done. “I’ll give you one short example. I spoke to the CEO of an energy company saying, ‘How long would it take you to put a wind turbine farm up?’ “He said, ‘I could do it in two years. You wouldn’t get any power out of it for 13 years because I’d lose five years to planning, and another six or seven years before the grid connected.’ We cannot go on like that.” Elsewhere, Sir Keir said he was “ready to do whatever is necessary to defend our country” when pressed on whether he would join military action in an “unforeseen crisis”, such as wars in Iraq and the Falkland Islands. He said: “I am ready to take whatever action we need to take to defend our country and to protect the country. “That is the first duty of any government. It’s why the Labour government back in the day signed the Nato treaty. It’s why the Labour government back in the day was the first to go down the road of nuclear deterrent. So, I’m ready to do whatever is necessary to defend our country.” He also continued to refuse to rule out raising capital gains tax, in what has become a long-running headache for Labour as the Tories seek to pin the party down on ambiguous pledges. Asked if Labour would increase the tax, he said: “All of our plans are set out in our manifesto.” Pressed on whether that meant it was a possibility, he continued to dodge the question, adding: “All our plans are set out in the manifesto, fully costed, fully funded and none of them, all launched yesterday, require tax increases, over and above the ones we’ve set out. “We are going to deal with the non-dom tax status. We are going to deal with the private… with the tax break for private schools, and the tax that we need to introduce or to extend on oil and gas companies. But none of our plans require any other tax rises.”                      14 Jun 2024-08:44PM GMT                                         That’s all for today                    Thank you for joining The Telegraph’s live coverage of day 21 of the general election campaign.

The prominent psephologist told The Times: “We know that basically, there isn’t that much enthusiasm for Labour — nothing like in 1997 [when Tony Blair was elected]. “Starmer has made his party acceptable, but he is not even as popular as David Cameron was before 2010. It’s a difficult gig.”                      14 Jun 2024-08:24PM GMT                                         Suella Braverman: Migration is to blame for Tories’ electoral woes                    Suella Braverman has blamed the Conservative Party’s “depressing” electoral position on its failure to tackle migration as she said she had urged Rishi Sunak to take action, writeTim Stanleyand Home Affairs EditorCharles Hymas. In an interview with The Telegraph, the former home secretary said she believed the Right would not be divided if the Government had taken action on migration sooner. Ms Braverman said she was not supporting Reform and made clear she was not attacking the Prime Minister, whose record on tackling inflation she praised. However, she said: “We shouldn’t have this split on the Right. If we’re a proper Conservative Party that just does what we promised to do, like cut migration and cut taxes, we would not have this division… and we’d have another 15 per cent added on to our polling right now.”                      Read the full story                      here                      .                                         14 Jun 2024-08:11PM GMT                                         Pictured: A meeting of minds                                         14 Jun 2024-08:00PM GMT                                         Why Reform will struggle to win any seats – despite beating the Tories in the polls                    One week ago, Nigel Farage voiced his goal for Reform to overtake the Conservatives in the polls, write Data JournalistOllie Corfe and Data EditorBen Butcher. On Thursday, a YouGov poll said he had finally achieved it, surpassing the Tories by one point. The poll has Reform on a national vote share of 19 points, with the Conservatives trailing on 18. Labour continues to be way ahead on 37 points. Despite this, very few experts, including the party itself, predict it will secure more than a handful of seats.

Asked if he was more principled than Sir Keir, the shadow health secretary told The Sun’s Never Mind The Ballots: “No, I don’t think so. We were wrestling with the same moral dilemma. “Let’s not forget that Keir Starmer was one of the vast majority of Labour MPs who voted no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn. “Keir Starmer resigned from Jeremy Corbyn’s front bench and then when Jeremy Corbyn was re-elected we all faced a terrible moral dilemma about how to avoid the Labour Party becoming extinct. “And what people like Keir Starmer, Tom Watson and a small number of members of the shadow cabinet did was to try and prevent the Labour Party from literally falling off a political cliff.”                      14 Jun 2024-07:25PM GMT                                         Starmer interview proves he ‘flip flopped’ to win Labour leadership, says Coffey                    Sir Keir Starmer admitted in the BBC interview that he “flip flopped” to win the Labour leadership in 2020, Therese Coffey has said. The former environment secretary wrote on X, formerly Twitter: “Keir Starmer admitting he flip flopped on what mattered to him in order to win the Labour leadership election. “It seems he will make promises to help him win an election but drop them without a thought.”                      14 Jun 2024-07:20PM GMT                                         Sunak on Reform: ‘Only poll that matters is July 4’                    Rishi Sunak has dismissed Reform UK overtaking the Conservatives in the polls, saying “the only poll that matters is the one on July 4”. Speaking at a press conference at the G7 in Italy, the Prime Minister said: “I think we’re only halfway through this campaign and the Conservative Party and me are going to fight for every single vote until the last day. “And you know, what you saw this week was actually an important moment in the campaign because the only poll that matters is the one on July 4. “What you did see this week is the two leading parties put out their manifestos for the future of our country, and there’s a very clear choice.” He added: “What I would say is if that poll and all these things were replicated on election day, what that would be is handing a blank cheque to Keir Starmer to increase people’s taxes on their home, their car, their job, their pension, their house, that’s what it will do. “So I’m going to continue fighting very hard to make sure everyone understands the choice that’s ahead of them.”                      14 Jun 2024-07:04PM GMT                                         Interview ends                    The BBC interview with Sir Keir Starmer has now ended.                      14 Jun 2024-07:00PM GMT                                         You’re a ‘Brexit-hating, tax-raising, industry-nationalising, Corbyn-praising, self-declared Socialist’, Starmer told                    Nick Robinson closed the BBC interview by telling Sir Keir Starmer that he was a “Brexit-hating, tax-raising, industry-nationalising, Corbyn-praising, self-declared Socialist”. Mr Robinson said: “What do you say to a voter who wonders if they can really trust a man who says he’s changed from the Brexit-hating, tax-raising, industry-nationalising, Corbyn-praising, self-declared Socialist?” The Labour leader answered: “I went to work in Northern Ireland, and I said I would, with others, I would change the police service of Northern Ireland, to make sure it gained the confidence of both communities. So, I said what I would do and I changed it. “I then led the Crown Prosecution Service, I said I would change it to make sure that it better protected victims, particularly in sexual cases. I said I would do it, I did it. “I came in and led the Labour Party, I said I would change it to put it back in a position to win elections and over four and a half years, I’ve done it with a steely determination. “So, every time I’ve said, I’ve gone into a leadership role and said this is what I’m going to do, I’ve then delivered it. So, I stand on my record and I have done this for a purpose, which is to ensure the Labour Party can win an election, bring back the change that is needed for millions of people in this country.”                      14 Jun 2024-06:58PM GMT                                         Starmer rules out bringing back EU freedom of movement                    Sir Keir Starmer has ruled out bringing back freedom of movement with the European Union. In a BBC interview, Nick Robinson said: “I simply want to ask you again if you’ll forgive me about this, see in this, the Keir Starmer Manifesto from 2019, it says, we need to defend migrants rights and argue for free movement in the EU. Doesn’t that tell you who’s side you’re really on when it comes to the debate about migration? Sir Keir replied: “Well, let’s take free movement. That was part and parcel of our membership of the EU. We’ve left the EU, freedom of movement is over. There’s no case for bringing it back. “ Mr Robinson interjected: “You argued for it after Brexit.” Sir Keir went on: I said as we were negotiating the exit from the EU. But that’s done. We’re out. We’re not going back and therefore we’re not having freedom of movement.”                      14 Jun 2024-06:57PM GMT                                         We will always have a special relationship with US, says Starmer                    Britain will always have a special relationship with the United States including if Donald Trump is the next president, Sir Keir Starmer has said. Asked if he would be prepared to stand up to the US, the Labour leader said: “Well, I’ll deal with each situation as it arises. We don’t simply do what any other country asks us to do. Every case has to be looked at on its merits. “That is a very special relationship. It will always be a special relationship with the US, whoever is the president. “Obviously, it will be up to the American people to decide who that is, and we and I, if we are elected into government, will deal with whoever is president of the United States.”                      14 Jun 2024-06:55PM GMT                                         Starmer: I am prepared to go to war                    Sir Keir Starmer has said he is prepared to go to war as Prime Minister. “I am ready to take whatever action we need to take to defend our country and to protect the country,” he said in an interview with the BBC. “That is the first duty of any Government. It’s why the Labour Government back in the day signed the NATO treaty. “It’s why the Labour government back in the day was the first to go down the road of nuclear deterrent.

Mr Robinson asked: “Are you hostile to people who go private? Do you think they’re queue jumpers, that it’s unfair?” The Labour leader replied: “I’m not hostile in the slightest. I completely understand why people would go private. “I know people who have because they wanted to have an operation more quickly, to get back to work or get back to something else.” The Labour leader said during the Sky News leaders’ special on Wednesday that he would not pay for a family member’s treatment even if they were stuck on an NHS waiting list.                      14 Jun 2024-06:52PM GMT                                         Starmer: Labour’s manifesto is about ‘wealth creation’                    The Labour Party manifesto is about “wealth creation”, Sir Keir Starmer has claimed. He told the BBC’s Nick Robinson: “Unlike some Labour leaders that may have sat in a chair like this in an interview with you, my manifesto is about wealth creation. “This is a party of wealth creation, of growth and therefore this boxing-in that everyone is trying to do, particularly in recent days that the only levers available to a Labour Government or Labour Prime Minister is to put up tax or pull down spending, I reject that. “Growth is the lever that I intend to pull.

Nick Robinson asked him: “Is Labour going to increase the tax that working person pays in capital gains?” Sir Keir replied: “Nick, all of our plans are set out in our manifesto.” Mr Robinson said: “So, they might?” Sir Keir said: “Let me finish the sentence. All our plans are set out in the manifesto, fully costed, fully funded and none of them, all launched yesterday, require tax increases, over and above the ones we’ve set out. “We are going to deal with the non-dom tax status. We are going to deal with the private equity loophole. We are going to deal with the tax break for private schools, and the tax that we need to introduce or to extend on oil and gas companies. “But none of our plans require any other tax rises.”                      14 Jun 2024-06:50PM GMT                                         In pictures: Starmer today, Starmer yesterday                                         14 Jun 2024-06:47PM GMT                                         Starmer: I ditched my leadership promises so Labour could change the country                    Sir Keir Starmer has said he ditched the promises he made when running for the Labour leadership so that he could change the country. Asked about his ditching of a raft of Left-wing policy promises, the Labour leader said: “Well, I took a decision, Nick, that we had to change the Labour Party, and drag it closer to the country. “And I did that having thought long and hard about the last four elections, because we lost in 2010, 2015, 2017, 2019, and I took the view that that was because we had drifted too far from working people, our central purpose, we had drifted to a place where we were essentially looking and feeling like a party that was looking down on people across the country, and we got very badly beaten in 2019.” He added: “I have changed my mind and the reason for that, is having reflected politically on those four losses in a row, I took the decision that we needed to change the Labour Party and drag it closer to the country.”                      14 Jun 2024-06:43PM GMT                                         Starmer denies using growth as ‘magic wand’                    Sir Keir Starmer has denied that promises of economic growth are his “magic wand”. Interviewed on the BBC, Nick Robinson told the Labour leader: “We’re back to your magic wand, aren’t you, it’s always, when you’re asked a tough question, you go, ‘Ah, I’ve got a magic want, it’s called growth’.” Sir Keir replied: “No, no, no, it’s not a wand, it’s a plan. That’s the complete difference. “Our manifesto that we launched is the culmination of four years work, working with business partners, working with others, about what is the change? So I say to every sector, what is inhibiting the growth that you need?”                      14 Jun 2024-06:42PM GMT                                         Starmer fails to rule out cuts to public services                    Sir Keir Starmer has failed to explicitly rule out cuts to public services. Nick Robinson asked the Labour leader: “I think the viewers will say, the question was, will there be cuts in other areas? And the independent experts say there will be cuts in other areas, unless you borrow more or tax more, or grow the economy incredibly fast. So are you saying there will be cuts or not?” The Labour leader replied: “Well, Nick, firstly, we’re not going back to austerity, I ran a public service during austerity, I know what that feels like, I know the damage that it did, and that’s been the legacy of the last 14 years, so we’re not going to go to austerity. “But secondly, I do want to take on this challenge that you rightly put to me in relation to tax and spend. Because the assumption of those that are saying these are the forecast is that we cannot do any better than we’ve done in the last 14 years. “In other words, it’s impossible to grow the economy, and therefore, you’re going to have to tax more, or spend less.”                      14 Jun 2024-06:40PM GMT                                         Sunak: G7 to work together to tackle illegal migration for first time                    G7 countries will work together to tackle illegal migration for the first time as Rishi Sunak declared the problem a “global emergency”, reports Deputy Political EditorDaniel Martin. The seven leaders agreed at the end of their two-day summit in southern Italy to form a coalition to prevent and counter the smuggling of migrants. Mr Sunak said he and summit host Giorgia Meloni, the Italian premier, led the discussion on migration where leaders agreed to enhance border enforcement. He said: “Illegal migration is now a global emergency. More people are moving across border than at any time in our history. We cannot stand by and watch this human tragedy unfold.”                      14 Jun 2024-06:36PM GMT                                         Starmer told Labour schools promise means one new teacher per three schools                    Labour’s promise to recruit 6,500 teachers over the next five years would equate to just one extra teacher for every three schools, Sir Keir Starmer has been told. Nick Robinson put it to the Labour leader that his plan would result in only “a third of a teacher per school”. Sir Keir responded: “Yeah, two things I’d say about that. Firstly, that is set out in the manifesto very clearly as a first step, a down payment, one of the steps that I hope that we’ll be taking literally on day one in government starting down that recruitment. “The second thing is the particular problem that we’re aiming this at is the lack of teachers in specific subjects in secondary school.” He added: “It is a very meaningful change for the children that need it.”                      14 Jun 2024-06:34PM GMT                                         Labour changes are not small, Starmer insists                    The changes proposed in the Labour Party’s manifesto are not “very small”, Sir Keir Starmer has insisted. “I don’t accept they’re very small,” he told the BBC’s Nick Robinson. “What we’ve set out in the manifesto is a plan for change, a plan to grow the economy. “I think that amongst the biggest problems of the last 14 years has been that the economy has been flat, we haven’t grown the economy, and therefore, we haven’t had the money to put into our public services, which are crumbling, and we haven’t been able to raise living standards. “So we have to have a plan for growth. This is a bold plan for growth.”                      14 Jun 2024-06:33PM GMT                                         Starmer: Labour is ready for government                    Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour is ready to govern with three weeks until polling day on July 4. Asked if he is ready for Government, the Labour leader told Nick Robinson: “Yes, I know that we’ve got to earn every vote and not a seat has been won yet, and therefore I’m not complacent about it. “But I’ve spent four and a half years changing the Labour Party, getting it into a position where we could put our offer before the country. “We unveiled our manifesto, a manifesto for wealth creation and for growth, to fix the fundamentals and take our country forward. “So, yes, we’ve prepared, we’re ready, but I’m conscious that every single vote has to be earned, and we’re still at the stage of earning the votes.”                      14 Jun 2024-06:32PM GMT                                         Interview begins                    Nick Robinson’s interview with Sir Keir Starmer has started.                      14 Jun 2024-06:21PM GMT                                         Starmer to face grilling over Labour’s tax plans                    Sir Keir Starmer is set to be grilled on Labour’s manifesto and plans for taxation by the BBC’s Nick Robinson.

The Prime Minister told a conference at the G7 in Italy: “It’s obviously wonderful, wonderful news. “I think the whole country will be behind the Princess of Wales for her recovery and I saw her statement earlier. “I thought it was brave.

The Labour leader said in an interview with the BBC’s Nick Robinson: “Well, Nick, we obviously had a referendum on this. I campaigned to remain, I voted to remain. “But the vote was to leave. We’ve left and we’re not going back into membership of the EU, that means the single market, the customs union.” Mr Robinson interjected to say “you’re not that keen on growth”, to which Sir Keir replied: “I do think we can do better than the botched deal that we got under Boris Johnson. I think every business thinks that. So if there are businesses that are watching this, yes I hear what you say about the barriers to trade and we are going to do something about that.” The Labour leader added that “the idea that the sort of single silver bullet is simply the relationship with the EU is not something I accept” on how to generate growth.                      14 Jun 2024-05:10PM GMT                                         I’ll be ‘tough’ on NIMBYs, says Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer has said he will be “tough” on NIMBYs in a BBC interview with Nick Robinson.

I won’t take long, but it makes my point. I spoke to the CEO of an energy company say, ‘How long would it take you to put a wind turbine farm up?’. “He said, ‘I could do it in two years’. He said, ‘You wouldn’t get any power out of it for 13 years because I’d lose five years to planning, another six or seven years before the grid connected’. “We cannot go on like that.

Laura Trott, the chief secretary to the Treasury, held a press conference on Friday to accuse Labour of having a secret plan to make the tax change, along with 17 other rises the party had refused to rule out.  Currently people who sell their main home do not pay capital gains tax because of the private residence relief.

In his Daily Mail column, the former Prime Minister wrote: “We must face the reality. Whatever the polls may say about the Reform surge, there is only one way to stop a Starmer government, or to reduce the size of a Starmer majority, and that is to vote Conservative. “Neither the Liberals nor Reform have the remotest chance of forming the Opposition – not in Parliament, not on the basis of the first-past-the-post system.” He added: “If Starmer gets a majority on the scale currently forecast, it won’t be just the rich who get soaked – it will be the entire population. “I really don’t think that’s what people want, and they should vote against it.

The former Prime Minister wrote in the Daily Mail that Sir Keir Starmer could win 461 MPs and a 292-seat majority. “With 461 MPs, there will be nothing and no one to stand in their way, or to stop them from doing whatever they damn well please,” he wrote. “We are looking at an elective dictatorship, a super-majority of a kind unknown to modern times, in which the sheer weight of Labour MPs will start to skew politics and change the direction of the country in a way that most voters have simply not bargained for.”                      14 Jun 2024-04:35PM GMT                                         Britain facing Labour majority as big as Blair and Thatcher combined, Johnson warns                    Britain is facing a Labour majority as big as Sir Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher’s combined, Boris Johnson has warned. Writing in his Daily Mail column, the former Prime Minister said: “Let’s suppose he gets a bigger majority than Margaret Thatcher in 1983. Imagine that he gets a bigger majority than any in the past 100 years – the biggest since the election of Stanley Baldwin in 1924. “That would in itself be a nightmare, and, in my view, the least-merited election triumph in history, by one of the least-scrutinised of Opposition leaders. “And yet I have to warn you, amigos: those numbers may well be an underestimate.” He added: “The coming Labour majority, if these polls are correct, will be about as big as Blair’s and Thatcher’s majority COMBINED.”                      14 Jun 2024-04:23PM GMT                                         Listen: The Daily T on the new seats and stats to watch as Reform surges                    It’s halftime in the election campaign, but who looks like they’ll make it to the last 16, and who is being unceremoniously sent home early?

Statistics released by the Electoral Commission show the Tories raised £574,918 in the first week after Rishi Sunak called the election on May 22. That figure is 90 per cent smaller than the £5.7 million the party received in the first week of Boris Johnson’s 2019 campaign. The data also reveals Labour raised the most in the first week of this campaign at £926,908, followed by the Conservatives’ £574,918 and the Liberal Democrats on £454,999. Reform UK brought in £140,000 during the same period and the Scottish National Party received just £36,305.                      14 Jun 2024-03:47PM GMT                                         Tory women ‘less subversive’ than Labour women, claims Harman                    The Conservatives have had more female leaders than Labour because Tory women are “less subversive”, Harriet Harman has claimed. The former acting leader of the opposition told Spectator TV: “Well it is a source of embarrassment and dismay that although we regard ourselves as the party of women and equality and factually the fact is we have done more than any other party on women and equality. “But paradoxically the Tory party have had three women Prime Ministers and we’ve not had a Labour leader, let alone a Prime Minister, who is a woman. “I think it’s partly because traditionally the Tory women have been more, they’ve been less subversive within the Tory party. “Whereas the Labour women have been, ‘We’re here to change everything and to challenge everything’ and then that’s not welcomed by the men and that doesn’t make you popular and therefore you don’t get to be leader.”                      14 Jun 2024-03:30PM GMT                                         Streeting yet to convince lifelong Tory father to vote Labour                    Wes Streeting is yet to convince his lifelong Conservative-voting father to vote for Labour at the general election. Asked about his plans for the weekend, the shadow health secretary told The Sun’s Never Mind The Ballots YouTube programme: “The plan is a pub lunch for Father’s Day with my dad and then I’m going to watch the [England vs Serbia] game with my dad probably at home or down the pub at the same time as I continue with my quest to persuade my lifelong Tory-voting dad to switch to Labour at this general election. “He’s already telling me that he’s planning to vote tactically at this election and increasingly that looks like his vote is going to go for Labour.” He added: “My dad and my grandad, they have been lifelong Tories. Where I’ve got him to is a massive achievement like lots of other millions of former lifelong Tory voters. “But as with them I’m not taking my dad’s vote for granted. I’m going to be working to persuade him right up until he puts that cross in the box.”                      14 Jun 2024-03:13PM GMT                                         Rigby was ‘almost run over’ before Sky leaders’ special                    Beth Rigby was almost run over on the morning of the Sky News leaders’ special on Wednesday. “The night before, I woke up at, like, five in the morning, fully awake,” the presenter told the channel’s Electoral Dysfunction podcast, adding that she decided to go for a run. She said: “I just saw I’m coming to the end of the road and I went to turn round and, as I turned, I nearly ran into a moving car.

In this counterintuitive romp through black modernity, I happily disrupt claims of race-based victory. I look at examples such as the tremendous success of black pupils in Hackney, the very non-black heroism of entrepreneur Mary Seacole and the new success of Nigerians across the globe. I argued that the factors that drive success for all groups are agency and self-affirmation. All have been blessed when they have looked beyond the castle of their skins.  So, it seems strange or maybe predictable that a new Labour administration will prioritise a new Race Equality Act that at its core attempts to close an ethnicity pay gap based on the framework used for gender.

In an open letter to the Labour leader, she warned that the party’s plans could lead to wide-scale job losses that would have a knock-on effect on local communities. “Many independent schools, like those mines once were, are the lifeblood of small communities. Policies which undermine their existence will have a devastating impact on the lives of many; and not just the children who attend them,” she said.

We should be encouraging people to have children, we should even perhaps through the tax system be encouraging marriage, as well.”                      14 Jun 2024-12:46PM GMT                                         Reform will unveil a ‘contract’, not a ‘manifesto’, says Farage                    Nigel Farage said the “word associated with manifesto is lie” and labelled Reform UK’s policy document-due to be unveiled on Monday-a “contract” instead. Asked what would be in the Reform manifesto, the party leader said: “We’ve got a radical plan to reduce the tax burden... it’s not a manifesto, the word associated with manifesto is lie, so we’re not going to play that game. “It’ll be our contract. It’ll be what we’re going to campaign for, in opposition, the arguments we’re going to make.”                      14 Jun 2024-12:40PM GMT                                         Farage: Tories will not be in power for at least a decade                    The Conservative Party is “done” and will be out of power for at least a decade, Nigel Farage said.  It was suggested to Mr Farage that the most realistic way for him to become leader of the opposition wpould be for him to join the Tories.  Asked if would rule that out, he replied: “Boring, boring, boring. They are done. The brand is done.”  He added: “The Conservative Party will not be in power for a decade, maybe more and you know, you can say to people, look, they have been around for 190 years.  “But occasionally these big seismic shifts do happen... I think this may well be one of those 50 or 100 year events that happens.”                       14 Jun 2024-12:31PM GMT                                         Reform’s rise not a ‘short-term commando raid’, says Farage                    Reform’s rise is a long-term project, Nigel Farage has insisted.  The Reform leader said “this is not a short-term commando raid, this is a five-year commitment”.  Mr Farage said that regardless of the result on July 4, Reform’s focus will immediately shift to the “building of a big movement” ready for the next general election, likely in 2029.                       14 Jun 2024-12:27PM GMT                                         Farage: Reform can get over six million votes                    Nigel Farage and Richard Tice are now answering questions.  Mr Farage said he believed on July 4 Reform will get more than the almost four million votes Ukip secured under his leadership in 2015.  He said: “We are not going to get four million votes. We are not going to get five million votes. We are going to get a very, very substantial number of votes.  “I genuinely think we can get over six million votes. I don’t know where the ceiling is.”                       14 Jun 2024-12:23PM GMT                                         General election is already over, claims Farage                    Nigel Farage repeated his claim that the general election is already “over”.  He said that “Labour has won” and the only question now is the “size of their majority”.  He argued that he would be best placed to lead the opposition to a Labour government in the House of Commons.  The Reform leader said Rishi Sunak would not be able to do it because he would “probably be in California anyway”.  “I believe that I can be that voice of opposition,” he said.                       14 Jun 2024-12:19PM GMT                                         Farage asks Starmer why tackling mass migration is not one of his top priorities                    Sticking on the subject of immigration, Nigel Farage said he believed “nothing will change under Labour, who knows, it may even get a little bit worse”.  The Reform leader said: “I would love, as I am now the leader of the opposition, to do a head-to-head with Keir Starmer to ask him: why?  “Why if you are going out looking for the working people of Britain to vote for you, have you not put this in your top six priorities?”                      14 Jun 2024-12:15PM GMT                                         Farage demands head-to-head debate with Starmer                    Nigel Farage has challenged Sir Keir Starmer to a head-to-head debate. The Reform leader told a press conference in central London this afternoon that he wanted to challenge the Labour leader on the issue of immigration. He said: “The BBC will be having a leaders’ debate, a four-way leaders’ debate, with the leader of the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives, Labour and the SNP. That takes place next week and I think we can demand that right now the BBC put us into that debate. “I would also very much like to do a debate head-to-head with Keir Starmer and the reason is very simple. We think that this should be the immigration election because whether we are talking about rents, whether we are talking about housing availability... there is no aspect of our national life that is not touched by the massive population crisis this country now faces.”  Mr Farage said he believed “nothing will change under Labour, who knows, it may even get a little bit worse” as he questioned why tackling mass migration was not one of Sir Keir’s top priorities.  The Reform leader said: “Why, if you are going out looking for the working people of Britain to vote for you, have you not put this in your top six priorities?”                      14 Jun 2024-12:11PM GMT                                         Reform now the ‘real opposition’ to Labour in Red Wall, says Farage                    Nigel Farage said Reform was now the “real opposition” to Labour in Red Wall seats.  The Reform leader said: “A Conservative vote in the Red Wall is now a wasted vote. We are the challengers to Labour, we are now the real opposition.”                       14 Jun 2024-12:09PM GMT                                         Farage: The inflection point has arrived                    Richard Tice has now handed over to Nigel Farage.  Mr Farage told the press conference that the “inflection point has arrived” as he said he was delighted when he saw last night’s YouGov poll.  The Reform leader claimed the party is “well ahead” of the Conservative Party in certain parts of the UK.                       14 Jun 2024-12:07PM GMT                                         No one expected Reform to overtake Tories so quickly, says Tice                    Richard Tice said there was no difference between Labour and the Tories.  The Reform chairman said that “both stand for higher taxes”.  Turning to last night’s YouGov poll, he said that “no one expected within less than two weeks, less than 12 days, we wouldn’t bother with equalling them [the Tories], we would leapfrong them”                       14 Jun 2024-12:04PM GMT                                         Tice: Reform has turned ‘boring’ campaign into ‘extraordinary’ campaign                    Richard Tice is now speaking at a Reform press conference in central London  He said that Reform had “turned what looked like being the most boring election campaign since any of us could remember into the most interesting and extraordinary campaign”.  He said that two weeks ago people were writing Reform off and believed the party would “disappear downwards”.  Mr Tice said that since the return of Nigel Farage the party has been “heading north” in the polls.                       14 Jun 2024-11:58AM GMT                                         Journalists await arrival of Farage and Tice                    Journalists are now waiting patiently for the arrival of Nigel Farage and Richard Tice at a press conference in central London.

Ms Trott, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, claimed at a press conference that Labour could put up 18 taxes. Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “It’s a sign of the chaos and desperation in the Tory campaign that they are spending their time talking about things they have imagined and that Labour isn’t doing, rather than the state of the country after 14 years. “The only surprise is that the imaginary ‘meat tax’ and the fantasy seven bins haven’t made another appearance. “Labour has published a fully funded and costed manifesto which will deliver the change this country needs after 14 years of Tory chaos. In contrast to the Tories’ unfunded plans which will leave families paying £4,800 more on their mortgages.”                      14 Jun 2024-11:23AM GMT                                         Labour election victory not ‘inevitable’, says Streeting                    Asked about the possibility of Labour securing a large majority on July 4, Wes Streeting, said: “I don’t believe the opinion polls for a moment. “I’ve been knocking on doors right across the country in seats that Labour needs to win in order to win the next general election, and there are millions of undecided voters out there.” Speaking at Wakefield Trinity Rugby League club, the shadow health secretary said: “I think what the Conservative Party is doing, quite cynically at the moment, is to say to people ‘if you want change, you don’t have to bother going out and voting for it, you can put your feet up, or you can vote for one of the smaller parties and their wish list of promises, because Labour’s going to win anyway’. “There is nothing inevitable about a Labour government after the next general election. We have to earn people’s trust.”                      14 Jun 2024-11:09AM GMT                                         Wes Streeting: Labour does not ‘underestimate’ Farage                    Labour does not “underestimate” Nigel Farage, Wes Streeting said.  Asked for his thoughts on the prospect of Mr Farage as a leader of the opposition, the shadow health secretary said: “I don’t underestimate Nigel Farage as a campaigner. He’s never been elected to Parliament before. I hope the people of Clacton won’t send him to Parliament this time. “One thing I would say to people about Nigel Farage is that he’s never been tested on actually delivering on the change he campaigns for. He’s never had that responsibility.” Mr Streeting was speaking during a visit to Wakefield Trinity Rugby League club in West Yorkshire.                      14 Jun 2024-10:53AM GMT                                         Sunak warns of Labour’s ‘Tax Trap Manifesto’                    Labour's Tax Trap Manifesto confirmed they would raise taxes to their highest level in British history. pic.twitter.com/DUIYVTnea4                      14 Jun 2024-10:44AM GMT                                         The 18 tax rises the Tories say Labour has not ruled out                    Laura Trott used a press conference in central London this morning to claim that Labour could put up 18 taxes.  She said the Tories had specifically ruled out 18 tax rises that Labour had not. The Conservative Party listed them as follows:                                             The new State Pension being dragged into income tax for the first time in history.                       Ending the 25 per cent tax free lump sum.                       Making tax relief on pension contributions less generous.                       Extending National Insurance to employer pension contributions.                        Increasing the number of council tax bands.                       Undertaking an expensive council tax revaluation as Labour have already done in Wales.                       Cutting council tax discounts, as Labour is currently doing in Wales.                       Applying capital gains tax to family homes by ending Private Residence Relief.                       Increasing the rate and level of stamp duty.                       New levies or charges on bills while accelerating the rollout of renewables.                       Increasing capital gains tax.                       Increasing Employers’ National Insurance (the ‘jobs tax’).                       Ending the Enterprise Investment Scheme.                       Cutting or ending the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme.                       Ending Venture Capital Trusts.                       Ending Business Asset Disposal Relief.                       Ending Agricultural Property Relief and Business Relief.                        Maintaining the expanded ULEZ zone in Outer London and expanding road pricing beyond London.                                                               14 Jun 2024-10:40AM GMT                                         Pictured: Sunak meets Modi at G7 summit in Italy                                         14 Jun 2024-10:36AM GMT                                         Senior Tory: Reform poll lead is ‘stark warning’                    Reform overtaking the Tories in an opinion poll has provided a “stark warning” about what could happen on July 4, Laura Trott said.  Asked about the rise of Reform after a YouGov survey put the party one point above the Tories, the minister said: “The Conservative Party are fighting for every single vote in this election and look, we are only halfway through, things can change, we have all seen things changing in elections.  “But the poll is a stark warning. If a result like this is replicated on election day, Keir Starmer would have huge and unchecked power to tax your home, your job, your car, your pension, however he wants and we are fighting for every vote.  “I know from my own conversations with voters that the choice is very clear., A vote for anyone other than Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives is a vote for Keir Starmer as prime minister.”                       14 Jun 2024-10:29AM GMT                                         Labour failing to rule out capital gains rise ‘unprecedented’, says Trott                    Labour’s failure to rule out increasing capital gains tax is “unprecedented”, Laura Trott said.  The Chief Secretary to the Treasury was asked what impact a capital gains increase could have on housebuilding.  She said: “This is unprecedented. What they are putting forward and the fact that they have explicitly failed to rule it out which is in stark contrast with what happened... with VAT, they couldn’t get out there quick enough to say ‘no, no, we are not raising VAT.  “They have just not done that on capital gains tax for primary residences and that is extremely telling.  “I do think it would be disastrous... for the housing market.”                       14 Jun 2024-10:18AM GMT                                         Tories claim Labour could implement 18 different tax rises                    Laura Trott claimed that Labour could put up 18 different taxes.  The Tory frontbencher told a press conference in central London: “There are in total 18 taxes that we have specifically ruled out but Labour won’t.  “These are the 18 tax rises that everyone at home should expect under a Labour government.  “These are the 18 tax rises that we refuse to let them do quietly. These are the 18 tax rises which Labour need to come clean about.”                      14 Jun 2024-10:15AM GMT                                         Minister won’t be drawn on potential for further tax cut promises                    Laura Trott is now answering questions.  The Chief Secretary to the Treasury was asked if she could rule out the Tories bringing forward more tax cut promises before July 4.  She refused to be drawn.  She said that there was a “substantial dividing line” on tax between Labour and the Tories and Labour’s “only plan is to put taxes up”.                       14 Jun 2024-10:13AM GMT                                         Taxes would be £58bn higher under Labour, claim Tories                    Senior Tory Laura Trott claimed taxes would be £58 billion higher under a Labour government than a Tory one.  The Chief Secretary to the Treasury told a press conference in central London: “Taxes will be £58 billion higher under Labour than under the Conservatives over the next Parliament.  “But this calculation is just based on the formal tax rises Labour have set out in their own documents. I am afraid to tell you there is more to come.”                       14 Jun 2024-10:10AM GMT                                         Labour has tax rises ‘coded into its DNA’, says senior Tory                    Laura Trott claimed that Labour “want to put your taxes up”.  The senior Tory said that while the Conservatives had pledged to cut taxes, the Labour manifesto “contained no tax cuts, only tax rises”. She said: “It is a Tax Trap Manifesto from a Labour Party that has tax rises coded into its DNA.  “Labour’s first, second and third answer to every problem is always the same: Raise taxes.”                       14 Jun 2024-10:06AM GMT                                         Labour manifesto would take tax burden to ‘record high’, says Trott                    Laura Trott, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is now on her feet at a press conference in central London.  Ms Trott said that Labour’s manifesto would “take the tax burden to a record high” but the “truth is much worse”.  She said that on top of what Labour set out yesterday in terms of tax rises there would have to be further tax rises of £2,000 per household to cover a £38.5 billion “blackhole” in the opposition’s plans.  “We know the size of the bill but not how they plan to pay for it,” she said.                       14 Jun 2024-09:56AM GMT                                         Coming up: Tory press conference to respond to Labour manifesto                    Laura Trott, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is due to hold a press conference in central London at 11am to set out the Tory response to Labour’s general election manifesto.

Allies of the former Labour leader, who is running to be an independent in the Islington North seat he has held for 40 years, said they were confident he could retain the seat. They claimed early canvassing suggested he was “neck and neck” with the Labour candidate Praful Nargund, with the other candidates “miles behind”.

The Reform UK leader was challenged about his previous remarks praising the Russian president as an operator, telling BBC Radio 5 Live: “Yeah, but not as a human being.” Asked why, Mr Farage replied: “How many years has he been in power? He’s gone from prime minister, to president, he’s a clever political operator. He kills journalists, I don’t like him as a human being in any way at all. “You can recognise the fact that some people are good at what they do even if they have evil intent.” Asked if Nazi Germany dictator Hitler was good at what he did, Mr Farage replied: “What, as a public speaker? What do you think? Clearly, hypnotic in a very dangerous way.”                      14 Jun 2024-09:12AM GMT                                         Johnny Mercer issues Reform warning                    Johnny Mercer, the Tory minister for veterans’ affairs, has told voters in the Plymouth Moor View constituency that voting for Reform would boost Labour chances of victory and result in “wall to wall socialists in Plymouth”.  The Tory candidate in the seat said in a campaign video: “Reform are not going to beat me in Plymouth.  “So if you want a Labour MP and you want to see wall to wall socialists in Plymouth then of course go and vote Reform or vote Labour, whatever you want to do.”  Mr Mercer said it was “not a done deal” in the seat and the Tories were “fighting like hell down here”.                      14 Jun 2024-08:57AM GMT                                         Labour planning to introduce social care cap by October 2025, says Streeting                    Introducing a cap on adult social care costs by October next year is part of Labour’s plan if they win the election, Wes Streeting has insisted. The pledge did not appear in the party’s manifesto when it was published yesterday. Adult social care charging reforms – including an £86,000 cap on the amount anyone in England has to spend on their personal care over their lifetime – had been due to be implemented by the Conservative Government from October 2023 but were delayed by two years. Mr Streeting, the shadow health secretary, was asked whether he could make a firm commitment to bringing in the cap in October 2025. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “That’s the plan, as things stand.” When put to him that did not sound like a firm commitment, he responded: “We don’t have any plans to change that situation and that’s the certainty and stability I want to give the system at this stage.”                      14 Jun 2024-08:45AM GMT                                         Labour’s ‘crazy’ private school tax raid will drive children to state sector, Mordaunt claims                    Labour’s plan to launch a tax raid on private schools is “crazy” and will drive more children into the state sector, Penny Mordaunt warned last night. During the seven-party debate hosted by ITV newsreader Julie Etchingham, the Commons Leader said Sir Keir Starmer’s proposal “doesn’t serve anyone” and is “the kind of dogma we need to keep out of the public sector”.  Addressing Angela Rayner during the event, she said: “What Angela and the Labour Party are going to do is, unbelievably, they are going to tax education”.  She added: “The result of that is some families will not be able to send their kids to the schools they’re currently going [to] but also they’ve admitted this week class sizes will go up as a consequence.  “It’s crazy and it doesn’t serve anyone and it’s the kind of dogma that we need to keep out of the public sector.”                      You can read the full story                      here                      .                                         14 Jun 2024-08:42AM GMT                                         JK Rowling criticises Labour on approach to conversion therapy                    You can't promise to implement Cass's recommendations but vow to prevent talking therapy with gender-questioning children on the basis that it's 'conversion therapy.'

A Labour government would force peers to retire at the end of the Parliament in which they reach 80 years of age.  Mr Streeting told LBC: “I do think it is important given the size of the House of Lords that we try and reduce the size of the House and retirement ages aren’t unusual and I think an 80-year limit is the right balance.”  Mr Streeting was told that Joe Biden, who is seeking re-election as US president, is 81. “And he is not a member of the House of Lords,” Mr Streeting said.  Asked to explain the rationale behind forcing peers to retire at 80, he said: “We have to draw the line somewhere.

The party broadcast a five minute message on Channel 4 which simply featured the words “Britain is Broken, Britain Needs Reform” against a black background.

The Prime Minister said the unveiling of the two respective manifestos had provided a “very clear sense of what each of us would do”.  He said: “Say what you want about it [the Tory manifesto], but it’s a very clear plan, a detailed set of bold actions. That’s how you deliver a more secure future for people and crucially, there’s a massive difference on tax.  “We want to cut your taxes at every stage of your life in work, setting up a business, buying your first home, when you’re retired, you’re a pensioner or if you have a family cutting taxes for everybody.  “The Labour Party consistently can’t tell you which taxes they’re going to put up but they are going to put them up and as we saw yesterday, they’re gonna raise the tax burden to the highest level in this country’s history. And that’s the choice for everyone at the election.”                      14 Jun 2024-07:34AM GMT                                         Sunak ‘still fighting for every vote’ after Reform overtake Tories in poll                    Rishi Sunak has warned Tory supporters considering voting for Reform that they will end up putting Sir Keir Starmer in Downing Street, writes Daniel Martin.  Responding to last night’s YouGov poll putting Reform ahead of the Tories for the first time, Mr Sunak said those voting for Reform were “handing a blank cheque to Labour”. And he pointed out that the Tory and Labour manifestos showed a “massive difference on tax”.  Mr Sunak was asked about the survey while at a summit of G7 leaders in Puglia, southern Italy. He said: “Ultimately, if you’re not going to vote for a Conservative candidate that makes it more likely that Keir Starmer is in No 10.” The Prime Minister went on: “We are only halfway through this election, so I’m still fighting very hard for every vote.  “And what that poll shows is-the only poll that matters is the one on July 4-but if that poll was replicated on July 4, it would be handing Labour a blank cheque to tax everyone, tax their home, their pension, their car, their family, and I’ll be fighting very hard to make sure that doesn’t happen.  “And actually, when I’ve been out and about talking to people, they do understand that a vote for anyone who is not a Conservative candidate is just a vote to put Keir Starmer in No 10. “So if you want action on lower taxes, lower migration, protected pensions or a sensible approach to net zero you’re only going to get that by voting Conservative.” Latest YouGov voting intention (12-13 Jun): Reform now 1pt ahead of the Tories for the first time, although this is still within the margin of errorCon: 18% (no change from 10-11 Jun)Lab: 37% (-1)Reform UK: 19% (+2)Lib Dem: 14% (-1)Green: 7% (-1)SNP: 3% (+1)… pic.twitter.com/brNybrUCbC                      14 Jun 2024-07:21AM GMT                                         Reform does not have target number of seats, says Farage                    Nigel Farage said Reform does not have a target for the number of seats it wants to win on July 4.  It was suggested to the Reform leader during an interview on BBC Breakfast that the party must have a target and he must know what it is.  He replied: “I have no idea. All I know is this. The Labour Party are massively ahead in the polls. The Conservative Party have not bounced one little bit in these first three weeks, they are not going to.  “My message is very simple, that Starmer is going to have a very big majority... I want us to become the opposition voice in Parliament and in the country. That is the ambition.”                      14 Jun 2024-07:10AM GMT                                         Farage guarantees Reform UK will win seats on July 4                    Nigel Farage has guaranteed Reform UK will win seats at the general election.  The Reform leader said a YouGov poll putting his party one point ahead of the Conservatives was “pretty remarkable”.  Mr Farage was asked during an interview on BBC Breakfast what he believed poll support for Reform could mean for the party on July 4, in terms of how many seats it could win.  He said the first past the post voting system was “not fit for purpose” and that in 2015 Ukip under his leadership had secured almost four million votes but only won a single seat in the House of Commons.  He said: “We are looking this time at many, many more votes than four million. We are hoping to get through the electoral threshold.  “Whatever we do, we may not get the number of seats we deserve. But are we going to win seats in Parliament? Yes. How many? There is three weeks to go, we have got momentum behind us.”                       14 Jun 2024-07:02AM GMT                                         Farage: Reform was not ready for general election                    Nigel Farage has admitted Reform UK was not ready when Rishi Sunak triggered the general election.  The Reform leader told BBC Breakfast this morning: “I will be honest with you, we weren’t ready for this general election. We very much hoped it would come in the autumn. It has been rushed upon us.”  He said Reform was now in a “remarkable” position after a “phenomenal start” to the campaign.                       14 Jun 2024-06:58AM GMT                                         Polling expert: Tories and Labour ‘losing ground’ to Reform and Lib Dems                    The Tories and Labour are “losing ground” to Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats, a polling expert said this morning.  Professor Sir John Curtice said there are now some “broad trends” emerging in the general election opinion polls, with the Tories and Labour going backwards while the smaller parties grow their share.  He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “There are now some broad trends in the polls and it is a story of both the Conservatives and the Labour Party losing ground as compared with the beginning of the campaign.”  He added: “So who is gaining? One is undoubtedly Reform. On average in the seven polls this week they are at 16 points. I think there is reason to believe that maybe that is slightly on the high side… but even so, certainly not short of 15 points.  “But the other thing that has also begun to emerge in polls this week is that the Liberal Democrats are now making some progress as well.”                       14 Jun 2024-06:50AM GMT                                         Tory minister rules out election deal with Reform                    Treasury minister Bim Afolami rejected suggestions that the Conservatives should consider striking an election deal with Reform UK. Asked if the Tories would consider a deal, he told Sky News: “No, no. It’s an election, we’re not doing deals with anybody.”                      14 Jun 2024-06:41AM GMT                                         Boris Johnson enters election battle as he endorses former Cabinet colleague                    Boris Johnson has entered the general election battle as he publicly endorsed Sir Simon Clarke.

Reform has previously pledged to introduce tax relief of 20 per cent on all private healthcare and insurance. The party will unveil its finalised manifesto on Monday next week.  Mr Tice told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “The NHS and healthcare in the UK is no longer fit for purpose. We have had a complete population explosion, we are spending way more on healthcare and yet the outcomes sadly are amongst the lowest in the western world.”  He added: “We have got to reform the way healthcare is done. We have talked before about the need to use millions more independent sector operations, even the Labour Party was starting to agree with me on that.  “And actually what we have also got to do is, for example, if you can afford to pay a bit more we should encourage you to pay a bit more by giving you a tax incentive to use the independent sector, much of which is not for profit, to ease the pressure permanently on the NHS.”                       14 Jun 2024-06:17AM GMT                                         Minister downplays significance of Reform overtaking Tories in poll                    Bim Afolami attempted to downplay the significance of Reform overtaking the Tories in an opinion poll.  The economic secretary to the Treasury rejected the suggestion that it was the moment the Conservative Party “feared”.  He told Times Radio: “No. Polls are polls. There is pretty much a poll every single day in this campaign. There will be more. This is one poll out of literally hundreds. “What it does show is that there is significant difficulty of Keir Starmer having unchecked power to do all the things like tax your home, your job, your car and your pension if people vote Reform.  “A vote for Reform is a vote for Keir Starmer.”                       14 Jun 2024-06:07AM GMT                                         Manifesto is ‘absolutely boxing Labour in’, says Ed Balls                    Ed Balls, the former Labour shadow chancellor, said the party’s manifesto risks being a “straitjacket”, with strict fiscal rules “absolutely boxing Labour in” if the party wins power.  He told his Political Currency podcast: “I think people will look back on this manifesto, which is now seen as cautious and careful, and think of it as being something which was very constraining, and a potentially risky thing to do for Labour because this manifesto is absolutely boxing Labour in. “It will be seen as a straitjacket, with tough fiscal rules and limits on borrowing, big commitments not to raise income tax or VAT or national insurance.” "This manifesto is absolutely boxing Labour in". Labour have launched their plans for government. But Ed Balls thinks their plans are a 'straitjacket' which could leave the party with little room for manoeuvre.

The Tories will attempt to pick apart the Labour manifesto at a press conference in central London this morning amid Rishi Sunak’s continued absence from the general election campaign.  Laura Trott, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, will set out the Tories’ response to Labour’s plans as the two parties seek to gain the upper hand as July 4 draws ever closer.  Mr Sunak remains out of the country as he attends the second day of a G7 summit in Italy, with the Prime Minister expected to be back on the campaign trail tomorrow.  Sir Keir Starmer will take part in a BBC general election interview this evening as he is grilled by presenter Nick Robinson from 7.30pm.

Sir David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said opinion polls “go all over the shop” during campaigns and they “don’t necessarily indicate the outcome”.  Asked if it was “all over”, Sir David told Sky News: “No. Certainly not on the basis of what I am seeing on the doorstep.  “This is my 11th election campaign. All of them, things go wrong on both sides, and the polls go all over the shop and they don’t necessarily indicate the outcome.”  Sir David argued that the Tory and Labour manifesto launches this week will focus minds and as people realise the latter is planning to put up taxes while the Conservatives are planning to cut them, things will change.  He said: “They are starting to look past all the shenanigans with Farage and so on and saying ‘you know I might have voted Reform but actually that’ll just help Labour, I am going to vote Tory’. I have seen that a number of times in the last few days.”                       14 Jun 2024-05:26AM GMT                                         We will take over Tory Party, claims Reform deputy leader                    Reform will eventually “take over” the Tories, the party’s deputy leader claimed, after a poll put Nigel Farage’s team ahead of the Conservatives for the first time ever.  David Bull told GB News: “The Tories are imploding. As you know, it is not one group. There are five, six different disparate groups, whether it is the ERG, the common sense group, for example, the Conservative growth group.  “There are all these different groups and they are all fighting. So we are focused on what we as Reform can do.  'The Tories are imploding, we are now the opposition.

Labour was in first place on 37 per cent.  Load-Date: June 14, 2024  End of Document
