   True blue Tories ‘banned from standing in the general election’ telegraph.co.uk April 5, 2024 Friday 7:28 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:4 Length: 2153 words Byline: By Gordon Rayner, Associate Editor, Allison Pearson Highlight: No 10 accused of purging ‘high-quality’ Right-wing candidates with traditional Conservative values to ensure party is dominated by centrists Body   Downing Street has been accused of blocking “true blue” Conservative candidates from standing in the general election as it wages a battle for the future of the Tory Party. Those on the Right of the party believe Rishi Sunak is trying to purge it of those who support low-tax, small-state conservatism  so that it will be dominated by centrists after the election. It would mean that if the Conservatives lose the election and Mr Sunak resigns, he will have already ensured it cannot move to the Right by packing the parliamentary party with One Nation Tories who would reject Right-wing leadership candidates. Some Tory MPs have expressed despair that high-quality applicants for the list of approved parliamentary candidates are being rejected because of their traditional Conservative values , while those who believe in high taxation and high public spending are put through, even if they lack the requisite skills to be an MP. It is the latest evidence of the civil war raging within the Conservative Party between those who believe it must move to the Right to combat the growing threat of Reform UK  and those who believe the only way to remain electable is to occupy the centre ground. Applicants who have spoken to The Telegraph describe those in charge of the selection process as “yellow Tories” whose preference is for candidates largely indistinguishable from Liberal Democrats. They describe a clear anti-Brexit bias among those who interview applicants and complain that rather than being grilled on Conservative values, they are asked multiple questions about promoting diversity. Aman Bhogal, a former diplomat who contested the Upper Bann seat in Northern Ireland in 2015 but has not been selected since, said the Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) was involved in a “stitch-up” by blocking Right-wingers from making it onto constituency shortlists. He said: “In the past, you were asked to talk about your Conservative values and your Conservative ideals, but that has all changed. Now it’s ‘tell us about how you have promoted diversity and how you have addressed white privilege’.” CCHQ is in charge of the approved candidates list, with a handful of people wielding immense control over who is accepted and who is rejected. Among those who would like to be a Tory MP is Lord Frost, the former Brexit negotiator, who has made it clear he would renounce his peerage to sit in the Commons. Although he has not made any public comment, The Telegraph understands he has been blocked by CCHQ from applying for seats in the Commons. Lord Frost is a critic of the party’s policy direction under the Prime Minister, and one Sunak loyalist suggested he was not being considered because “he is a member of the House of Lords who is also trying to remove the Party leader”. David Campbell Bannerman, a former Conservative MEP who has been on the approved list of candidates since 2019, says he is being blocked from progressing to the long list for any particular seat “because I wasn’t being nice enough about Rishi Sunak”. He said: “The whole thing is fixed. It’s pretty blatant and undemocratic. The members have woken up to it and are pushing back against it because they are not getting the choice of candidates that they want. “This is not about me but about the wider system. It is happening to a whole range of good candidates who are left mystified, let down and driven out of the party. It’s all about power and control and a lack of democracy letting the people down.” Another candidate who has been overlooked said: “Essentially, true blue Conservative candidates are just campaign fodder, people who will shove leaflets through doors – CCHQ has no serious intention of letting them stand in a winnable seat, if at all. They only want candidates who are One Nation Conservatives  and it’s no wonder we are getting a low calibre of new MPs coming through. “When I applied for a seat, the chairman of the local association rang me and said they wanted me to be their candidate, but of course, I was blocked by CCHQ. “If, like me, you’re pro-Brexit, tough on immigration and want low tax, CCHQ see you as a repulsive headbanger. Too many in the party might as well be Liberal Democrats. ” Problems with the selection process have been blamed for MP defections in recent years, including former Totnes MP Sarah Wollaston and former South Cambridgeshire MP Heidi Allen, both of whom jumped ship to Change UK and then the Lib Dems, and former Wokingham MP Phillip Lee, who defected to the Lib Dems. To date, 63 Conservative MPs have announced they are standing down at the election. The record number of Conservatives who have stood down from Parliament in a single term is 75, which was set in the run-up to the 1997 election. A YouGov poll earlier this month suggested the Tories could suffer their biggest-ever electoral defeat, with Mr Sunak on course to retain just 155 seats, ten fewer than Sir John Major was left with after Labour’s 1997 landslide. A CCHQ source said: “These claims have no basis in fact. It’s obviously a bit difficult for candidates who attack the party leader to be selected given they will be asking constituents to cast their votes for him to be Prime Minister. “But the idea that people are not being put forward because of some ideological bent is totally false. This is the PM who is cutting taxes, bringing in major immigration curbs, curbing the excessive elements of net zero and trying to get illegal immigrants sent to Rwanda. That’s hardly some Left-wing agenda.”                      ‘CCHQ is obsessed with diversity’                                         By Gordon Rayner, Associate Editor                    When Gary Pound* made his way to the basement of Conservative Campaign Headquarters for his candidate selection interview, he was preparing himself for questions about law and order, immigration and taxation. He need not have bothered. During a one-hour interrogation in a glass-walled box, the primary focus was on diversity, not politics. Mr Pound had once been considered such an outstanding candidate that he was on a priority list, making him eligible to apply for any vacant constituency. This time, though, he did not make it onto the list at all. “They were just obsessed with diversity,” said Mr Pound, a successful businessman who has been a committed and active member of the Conservative Party since university. “They wanted to know what I had done to promote diversity within the party and within politics generally. “Most Conservatives are meritocrats so they just want the best people, regardless of their sex or ethnicity, but it’s clear they are no longer picking people on merit. “It also seemed clear that if you voted for Brexit, like me, your card was marked. “It seems the party is being purged of true believers in Conservative values, and the people that should be Liberal Democrats who have infiltrated the party are taking over.” MPs and party insiders have expressed deep misgivings about the candidate selection process, which has long-term implications for the Tory Party and the direction it is taking. The growing row over who will stand in the next election is regarded by some as a symptom of how dysfunctional the Conservative Party has become as different factions wrestle for control over its uncertain future. Even if he loses the election and quits as party leader, Rishi Sunak can determine what sort of party his successor inherits by controlling the list of potential parliamentary candidates. Constituency associations have the final say over who stands as their parliamentary candidate, usually choosing from a short list of three or four, but CCHQ can block Right-wing candidates so that only One Nation Conservatives, as the centrists call themselves, are put forward. The CCHQ gatekeepers include Gareth Fox, chief of staff to the chairman of the candidates committee, a Remainer who was tasked by David Cameron with making the party more diverse, and Baroness Jenkin of Kennington, who co-founded Women2Win with Theresa May almost 20 years ago with the aim of increasing the number of female Tory MPs. Other influential figures include Matt Wright, chairman of the candidates committee; Matt Lane, director of candidates, and long-term No 10 fixer Dougie Smith, who helps to vet candidates and acts as a liaison between Downing Street and the candidates committee. Would-be MPs must submit a written application, which is followed by due diligence checks and then an interview in front of a Parliamentary Assessment Board, usually comprising two people, one of whom may be a sitting MP. Those who pass are entered onto the approved list of candidates, which is subdivided into those on the comprehensive list, who can apply for any seat that comes up; the key list, who can usually only apply for the seat where they live, and the development list, which means they will be considered for unwinnable seats where they can gain experience of campaigning. So far, 63 Conservative MPs have already announced they will step down at the election, meaning candidates are now being selected to stand in their constituencies. People who apply to be considered for a particular seat are considered by the candidates committee, which produces a long list and then works with the local association to whittle the list down to a shortlist of three or four in a process known as sifting. Aman Bhogal, a 39-year-old former diplomat and founder of the Global Britain Centre, which campaigns for free trade and free enterprise post-Brexit, also believes he has been snubbed because of his Brexiteer credentials. He said: “I joined the party when I was still at school and I once worked out that I have spent about 14,000 hours campaigning by knocking on doors, distributing leaflets and so on. “In the past when I have been interviewed by a Parliamentary Assessment Board I have been asked about my Conservative ideals, but now it’s all about diversity. “You are asked how you would promote inter-racial harmony and the answer they’re looking for is that you would take the knee with Black Lives Matter. “It’s rotten and it’s shoddy. Along with a lot of other people I am thinking of switching to Reform.” Mr Bhogal said that after trying and failing to get onto the shortlist for 15 different constituencies, he met Mr Fox and Mr Lane to ask them what he was doing wrong. He said: “I was told my application was perfect and what they call my political footprint was spot on, but that I wasn’t getting people to call in and support me. “They said, ‘who do you know in the Cabinet?’ and told me to get Cabinet ministers to call association chairmen putting me forward. I walked out very saddened.” Mr Bhogal believes he has been blocked because he campaigned for Brexit and backed Liz Truss for the Tory leadership. He said: “Bear in mind that two-thirds of the party members voted for Liz Truss to be leader, so if they are alienating all of those people that’s not creating a unified party at all.”                      Allison Pearson                    Even Thatcher wouldn't get on the list in today's Tory party The process of sifting candidates can be short-circuited by CCHQ in the case of a by-election when a candidate needs to be chosen quickly. In those circumstances, CCHQ can impose a shortlist on an association, which might contain only one truly viable candidate, meaning the system can be gamed. One person on the approved list of candidates claimed some MPs who have already decided to stand down are being told to wait until the election is called before announcing their retirement so CCHQ can use the by-election rules to impose its own candidates on local associations. Some of those might include current MPs tempted to do a “chicken run” to a safer seat than their own, or MPs whose seats are being abolished under boundary changes that will take effect at the election. A Tory councillor who holds a Cabinet position on his local authority said: “There is a gulf between what the membership wants and what the party hierarchy wants. “The odd thing when I applied was the number of ex-Liberal Democrats that were applying, and it was quite clear that that was the type of person they were looking for.” Wendy Whittaker-Large, a property investor from Cheshire who was rejected after saying she was a small state, low-tax Tory, agrees. She said: “The people who were getting through were those who believe in high taxes and high public spending – basically Lib Dems.” A scientist who was taken off the list after 10 years said they were told by Mr Fox that they “were not political enough” after saying they did not agree with the Government’s response to Covid. A barrister who was rejected by CCHQ said: “The Left wing of the party is in charge and they won’t let anyone else in. But the mistake is that the country and the party need both wings of the party.” *Some names have been changed to protect the anonymity of those who spoke to the Telegraph Load-Date: April 5, 2024  End of Document
