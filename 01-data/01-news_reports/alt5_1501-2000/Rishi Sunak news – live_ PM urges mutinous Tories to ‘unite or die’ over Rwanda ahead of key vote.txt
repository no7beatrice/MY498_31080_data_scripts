   Rishi Sunak news – live: PM urges mutinous Tories to ‘unite or die’ over Rwanda ahead of key vote The Independent (United Kingdom) December 8, 2023 Friday 7:33 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: UK POLITICS,UK; Version:30 Length: 11602 words Byline: Matt Mathers Highlight: PM faces growing pressure over flagship illegal migration policy Body   Rishi Sunak  has urged mutinous Tory MPs to “unite or die” ahead of a key Commons vote on his controversial bid to save his party’s ailing plan to send asylum-seekers  to Rwanda.  The prime minister harkened back to the first days of his premiership with the call to MPs at a meeting of the 1922 Committee  this week, according to The Times, which carried claims that some Cabinet ministers are “on manouevres” in case of an earlier-than-expected Tory leadership race. There are claims that nearly two-dozen MPs have submitted no confidence letters, and in an olive branch to rebels, Mr Sunak is said to be “happy to have conversations” about his Rwanda plan’s future, providing the Bill – disliked by both Tory moderates and hardliners – passes through the Commons. It is a last-ditch bid to get planes in the air  after the Supreme Court ruled the government’s previous plans illegal. The legislation gives ministers the powers  to disregard sections of the Human Rights Act, but does not go as far as allowing them to dismiss the European Convention on Human Rights.                       Key Points                                                                No 10 declines to say if it will compromise with rebels                       Government open to compromise on bill -minister                       Rwanda deal costs will rise to £290m                       18 Tories have submitted no confidence letters -report                       Sunak begs Labour to back Rwanda plan and he insists Tories not a ‘joke’                                                              Nigel Farage will find it ‘very hard to resist’ political comeback, says ally                    Nigel Farage could soon stage a return to frontline politics by playing a leading role for the Conservatives’ right-wing rivals Reform UK, the party’s leader has said. Richard Tice said the star of ITV’s I’m a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! would find it “very hard to resist” a big comeback ahead of the next year’s general election. Some senior Tories have suggested they would like to see Mr Farage join the Tories – with one MP suggesting he could be given a peerage and made home secretary. However, Mr Tice suggested Mr Farage was keen to take up a prominent role for Reform UK once again, the party he co-founded from the ashes of the Brexit Party. “He needs to make the judgment – does he want to come back full time into politics?” the Reform leader told The Telegraph.

It is very concerning that he can’t defend the Bill,” Ms Braverman said, in a blow to Mr Sunak as he hopes to persuade MPs to back him in Tuesday’s vote. She added: “The public are relying on us to stop the boats. What do we say to them when we pass another law that fails? Time is running out.”                      As MPs weigh up whether to back Sunak plan, Braverman now in behind Jenrick, with argument that is going around the Tory groups in right. “[Jenrick] knows the detail.

That’s what Ted Heath discovered in Feb 1974,” he tweeted, referring to the former Tory leader’s decision to call an election seeking to wrest power away from unions.And as Matt Chorley of Times Radio notes, the Tories have been polling lower than Labour on immigration since last September, according to YouGov’s tracker.Given the Tories are currently behind Labour, “Don’t Know” and “None” on best party on asylum and immigration, I’m not sure how smart this idea is https://t.co/cchlPCtYpi pic.twitter.com/xySX1TCgMq — Matt Chorley (@MattChorley) December 9, 2023 Sunak’s ethics adviser urged to probe whether PM ‘broke ministerial code’ over Rwanda payment11:10 , Andy Gregory Rishi Sunak must be investigated over whether he breached the ministerial code by failing to declare a £100m payment to Rwanda, the Liberal Democrats have urged his ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus.The payment – sent to Kigali in April on top of the £140m already paid – was only revealed eight months later in a letter to MPs sent by the Home Office’s top civil servant, Sir Matthew Rycroft, on Thursday.Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine urged Mr Magnus to investigate what appeared to be a “clear breach” of the ministerial code, calling it “outrageous” that the public was “kept in the dark about the true costs of the Rwanda deal for eight months”.“The public deserves transparency, not hushed-up backroom dealings. We need an urgent inquiry to get to the bottom of this,” she said.While Sir Laurie can privately raise matters that could have been breaches of the rules, he cannot launch an investigation without approval from the prime minister.ICYMI: Britain facing surge of salmonella cases because of Brexit, union warns10:52 , Andy Gregory Britain is facing a surge in salmonella cases due to a lack of post-Brexit quality checks on food, a union has warned.The National Farmers Union told The Independent that the UK was seeing recurring cases of salmonella because meat, poultry and eggs have not been checked properly since leaving the EU.It comes as the Food Standards Agency (FSA) said it was investigating a recent rise in cases of salmonella food poisoning linked to poultry from Poland.“A number of the cases have involved the consumption of eggs produced in Poland and used in meals in restaurants and cafes,” said Tina Potter, head of incidents at the FSA.My colleagueAlexander Butlerhas the full report:Britain facing surge of salmonella cases because of Brexit, union warns Keir Starmer insists he’s no Thatcher ‘fan boy’ and says she did terrible things10:38 , Adam Forrest – political correspondent Sir Keir Starmer has attempted to calm the storm of criticism over his comments about Margaret Thatcher by telling a Scottish audience that she did “terrible things”.The Labour leader sought to draw a line under the row after he appeared to praise the former Tory prime minister and her moves to boost Britain’s “entrepreneurialism”.On a visit to Scotland on Friday, Sir Keir insisted he is no fan of Ms Thatcher and said that he “profoundly disagrees” with some of her actions.He said she did “huge damage” to communities across the UK – particularly in Scotland – only days after listing her as among former leaders who delivered “meaningful change”.Keir Starmer insists he’s no Thatcher ‘fan boy’ Kemi Badenoch pens ‘leadership campaign’ for The Sun10:19 , Andy Gregory Trade secretary Kemi Badenoch has written an opinion piece claiming that Brexit has “paid dividends” and looking ahead to the next general election, in what The Independent chief political commentatorJohn Rentoul suggests amounts to the minister’s “leadership campaign in The Sun”.As The Times claims Ms Badenoch is among potential Tory leadership hopefuls “on manouevres and sounding people out” in the event that Mr Sunak’s premiership collapses, she writes: “Brexit was a vote of confidence by the British people in our country. “A conviction that we would be better off as masters of our own fate. That conviction has paid dividends and it will keep doing so because I am determined to work day in and day out to reap the benefits of Brexit.The greatest threat to Brexit Britain’s prosperity booming in the second half of the 2020s is Sir Keir Starmer. A man who, for reasons unknown, clearly yearns for us to blindly copy and paste whatever Brussels does, and whose Shadow Foreign Secretary cannot even rule out rejoining the EU. “But I for one am confident the British people will act as wisely in 2024 as they did in 2016.”Kemi Badenoch’s leadership campaign in The Sun https://t.co/nuqUde0kgS pic.twitter.com/PZCg9p5EA6 — John Rentoul (@JohnRentoul) December 9, 2023 Robert Jenrick insists Sunak’s asylum plan will fail10:03 , Andy Gregory Senior Tory Robert Jenrick – who quit as immigration minister over Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda legislation – has insisted it will fail and accused the PM of failing to keep his word “to do whatever it takes” to “stop the boats”.In his op-ed for The Telegraph on Saturday, Mr Jenrick said “some of the country’s finest legal minds” have determined that migrants will be able to lodge legal appeals and that they could be “taken off flights in considerable number”.The ally of sacked home secretary Suella Braverman added: “The idea, therefore, that this bill will guarantee all those arriving are detained and swiftly removed is for the birds.”Mr Jenrick also said that the Tories will be treated to “red-hot fury at the ballot box” unless they bring down current levels of legal immigration – which he argued makes integration into UK life “impossible”.Our political correspondentAdam Forresthas more in this report:Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda plan has only ‘50% chance of success’, say government lawyers Jenrick argues against ECHR in op-ed showing his drift from Tory centrist to hardliner09:20 , Andy Gregory Robert Jenrick, the formerly moderate ally of Rishi Sunak who resigned as immigration minister this week, has written a lengthy piece in the Daily Telegraph warning that the PM’s Rwanda legislation will fail and claiming that the “public’s patience has already snapped” on immigration.Suggesting a significant drift to the right during his time in office, Mr Jenrick appears to argue in favour of abandoning the European Convention of Human Rights and international asylum law.He wrote: “Controlling our borders would, of course, be far more straightforward if we extricated ourselves from the complex web of international frameworks that have taken on near mythical status within Government. “These treaties were designed for a different world and have since been stretched beyond their intention. It will only become painfully more apparent that these outdated treaties cannot be renegotiated any time soon, so they must give way.”In more inflammatory rhetoric, he concluded: “There is no better example of the failed Westminster consensus over the last 30 years than the historically unprecedented levels of immigration that have been forced on voters against their wish. “As we are seeing in election after election across Europe, immigration will be a defining issue of 21st century politics. The public’s patience has already snapped. Centre-Right parties across Europe have a choice: begin to deliver on the mainstream concerns of ordinary people when it comes to immigration, or face their red-hot fury at the ballot box.”Jenrick’s resignation a ‘lightning rod’ for Sunak’s Rwanda critics08:39 , Andy Gregory The resignation of Rishi Sunak’s former ally Robert Jenrick as immigration minister has acted as a “lightning rod” to other Tory MPs with concerns about the Rwanda policy, it has been suggested.“He knows the absolute shambles of the system and if he has concerns about the bill, people are going to sit up and take notice,” one former colleague told The Times.  However, others suspect Mr Jenrick’s resignation may have more to do with Mr Sunak’s failure to promote him to Cabinet.Either way, the paper reported claims that Mr Sunak is “very, very down” and not his “usual Tiggerish self” following Mr Jenrick’s resignation – a suggestion one No 10 source rejected, however, insisting the PM remained upbeat and determined to “bash through” opposition.Sunak urges Tories to ‘unite or die’ over Rwanda scheme08:10 , Andy Gregory Rishi Sunak has urged mutinous Tory MPs to “unite or die” ahead of a key Commons vote on his controversial bid to save his party’s ailing plan to send asylum-seekers to Rwanda.The prime minister’s call to the 1922 Committee this week, after publishing his emergence Rwanda legislation, echoed his words in the first days of his premiership after taking over from Liz Truss, according to The Times.Rwanda legislation given ‘50% at best’ chance of success07:02 , Adam Withnall Rishi Sunak’s emergency Rwanda  legislation has been given only a “50 per cent at best” chance of successfully getting removal flights off next year in an official legal assessment for the government.Attorney general Victoria Prentis has been told that the legislation leaves a significant risk of the European Court of Human Rights  blocking planes to Kigali, the Times first reported.The assessment is likely to toughen the prime minister’s battle to get his divided Tory MPs  to support his new Bill that he hopes will revive the stalled £290 million policy.Read more:Sunak’s Rwanda legislation given ‘50% at best’ chance of success Taxpayers foot £300k energy bill for MPs’ second homes07:00 , Jane Dalton Reminder: MPs  have charged taxpayers almost £300,000 for energy bills  and other utilities at their second homes over the past year, a new analysis by The Independent found:Taxpayers foot £300k energy bill for MPs’ second homes Poll gives Labour huge lead06:00 , Jane Dalton Labour are up one point and the Conservatives are down three, according to the latest polling, giving Labour a 20-point lead:Westminster Voting Intention:LAB: 45% (+1)CON: 25% (-3)LDM: 11% (+2)RFM: 9% (+1)GRN: 5% (-1)SNP: 2% (-1)Via @wethinkpolling , 7-8 Dec.Changes w/ 30 Nov -1 Dec.— Election Maps UK (@ElectionMapsUK) December 8, 2023 Britain facing surge of salmonella cases because of Brexit, union warns05:00 , Jane Dalton In case you missed it: Britain  is facing a surge in salmonella  cases due to a lack of post-Brexit quality checks  on food , a union  has warned:Britain facing surge of salmonella cases because of Brexit, union warns Cleverly begins U-turn on Brexit ban on schools ID cards04:00 , Jane Dalton One of the flagship Brexit  policies on immigration – banning Europeans from travelling to the UK with only a national identity card  – has begun to be quietly reversed:Home Office U-turn on ID card ban for French school groups Recap: Sunak rules out quitting ECHR as Braverman attacks03:00 , Jane DaltonRishi Sunak  ruled out a radical move to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR ) – despite a rebellion by the Tory right that threatens his ‘plan B’ Rwanda  legislation:Sunak rules out quitting ECHR as Braverman attacks PM Analysis: The questions Rishi Sunak will face at the Covid inquiry02:02 , Jane Dalton Rishi Sunak and the Treasury put up some resistance to lockdown measures, on economic grounds, during Covid.

Conservative former cabinet minister Virginia Bottomley offered the advice to the Church of England bishops who sit in the upper chamber as peers took part in the annual debate led by the Archbishop of Canterbury.Baroness Bottomley of Nettlestone said: “I passionately want the Lords spiritual to remain but I do not think they enhance their prospects by looking like a Persil advertisement.“I have spoken to virtually every bishop about removing the robes. You don’t need to wear them.“So long as the bishop saying prayers — officiating – is wearing a robe, you can then keep the Robing Room, but all the others really should modernise their attire and look more normal, even though in their dog collars and very attractive shirts.”Half voters don’t think Rwanda plan is value for money00:01 , Jane Dalton Voters are sceptical about whether the government’s Rwanda migrants plan represents good value for money, a poll shows.In a YouGov survey, nearly half of those questioned (49%) said it was not.

This is what stood out:The ten key takeaways from Boris Johnson’s UK Covid inquiry witness statement Strike minimum service levels take effectFriday 8 December 2023 19:20 , Jane Dalton The first regulations aimed at ensuring minimum levels of service during strikes have come into force, the government has announced.Ministers said the regulations would apply in the rail sector, border security and ambulance services.For the railways, minimum service levels will mean that rail operators can aim to run 40% of their normal timetable during any strike.For a strike affecting infrastructure services, certain key routes will also be able to stay open and for longer than is normally the case during strikes, said officials.A Statutory Code of Practice has also come into force which sets out the “reasonable” steps trade unions should take to ensure their members comply with work notices.Where minimum service level regulations are in place and strike action is called, employers can issue work notices to identify people who are “reasonably required to work” to ensure minimum service levels are met.The law requires unions to ensure their members who are identified with a work notice comply, and if they fail to do this, they will lose legal protection from damages claims.The government has raised the maximum damages that courts can award against a union for unlawful strike action. For the biggest unions, the maximum award has risen from £250,000 to £1 million.Fund manager founded by Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg to close after £2bn withdrawalFriday 8 December 2023 18:50 , Jane Dalton A fund manager co-founded by Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg  is winding down after its largest client withdrew billions of pounds:Fund manager founded by Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg to close after client withdraws £2b No fines for Tory lockdown party in parliamentFriday 8 December 2023 18:27 , Jane Dalton The Metropolitan Police  have closed their investigation into a lockdown birthday party  in Parliament  by the deputy speaker and issued no fines, they say:No fines for Tory lockdown party in parliament, Met says Sunak did not mislead MPs over cost of Rwanda scheme, No 10 saysFriday 8 December 2023 18:00 , Matt Mathers Rishi Sunak did not mislead MPs  over the cost of his troubled Rwanda  asylum scheme, Downing Street said, after it emerged the UK paid Kigali an extra £100 million.The policy attracted fresh criticism when it was revealed the additional payment was made this year, while flights remained grounded amid a series of legal setbacks, on top of the £140 million previously paid out.Sophie Wingate reports: Sunak did not mislead MPs over cost of Rwanda scheme, No 10 says ICYMI: Can Rishi Sunak rescue his Rwanda plan and will Labour really help him?Friday 8 December 2023 17:00 , Matt Mathers The prime minister is determined to push on with the policy despite right-wing resistance from within his own party and a hostile opposition, saysSean O’Grady.Read Sean’s full piece here:How is Rishi Sunak trying to rescue his Rwanda plan and will Labour really help him?

I wouldn’t pre-empt that process.“But we’ll be setting out why we believe our approach is the best and swiftest way to get flights off the ground.”It comes after minister Tom Pursglove suggested that ministers were open to engaging MPs on their concerns about the Bill ahead of the debate next week.Braverman signed off on extra £100m -No 10Friday 8 December 2023 14:25 , Matt Mathers Downing Street said the extra £100 million spent by the UK government on its grounded Rwanda scheme was signed off by former home secretary Suella Braverman.Asked who approved the money, which was sent in April, a No 10 spokeswoman said: “The home secretary. It’s an operational decision to release funding under the MOU.”‘Unforgivable’ Tories have spent £240m on Rwanda -Lib DemsFriday 8 December 2023 14:15 , Matt Mathers The Liberal Democrats have said it is “unforgivable” that the Conservative government has now wasted over £240m on the failed Rwanda deal, as analysis reveals this could have funded over 5.7 million GP appointments instead,Archie Mitchellreports.Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael MP said: “The fact that this government is content to squander millions on this totally unworkable white elephant of a policy tells you everything you need to know about their priorities.“Three home secretaries and millions of taxpayers’ pounds later, the Conservatives have nothing to show for their failing Rwanda policy. It’s an unforgivable waste of taxpayers’ money -and to think this could have paid for more than five million GP appointments just puts salt in the wound.“It’s time for the Conservatives to accept reality and abandon this impractical, inhumane and extortionately expensive policy.”Top civil servant hauled before committee over Rwanda costsFriday 8 December 2023 14:03 , Matt Mathers Home Office permanent secretary Sir Matthew Rycroft has been summoned to appear before the public accounts committee on Monday, a day before MPs vote on the government’s Rwanda legislation.“Full and frank answers” on the costings of the deportation scheme are expected from him, home affairs committee chairwoman Dame Diana Johnson and public accounts committee chairwoman Dame Meg Hillier wrote in a letter to the top civil servant.They said they “would have expected more transparency” from him previously and that they saw “no reason” why he did not disclose extra payments to Kigali when he gave evidence to their committees over the last few weeks.“Given the high profile of this scheme which is now subject to a major piece of legislation we expect quarterly updates to be provided to Parliament from now on,” they said.Deputy PM slams Bristol University’s decision to scrap national anthemFriday 8 December 2023 13:45 , Matt Mathers Deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden appears to be threatening to cut funding from the University of Bristol over a report by MailOnline that it has axed the National Anthem from graduation ceremonies amid students’ claims it is “old-fashioned” and “offensive to some”,Archie Mitchellreports."If Bristol University are too ashamed of their British heritage, presumably they no longer want to be subsidised by British taxpayer?"

Most of the people running the cybersecurity industry in the UK I’ve either worked with directly or are familiar with me.“But most importantly, they are familiar with my team’s work. So I think I need to stress a few points here that we are kind of glossing over. Information in your phone is not just stored on an app, it’s actually stored throughout the hardware and the operating system.”She added: “There are data stores throughout both and frequently that means that when information is deleted, a person can recover this information. So we would use our team’s technical abilities to recover and re-evaluate all that data.”Sunak was warned Rwanda bill was at risk of failingFriday 8 December 2023 09:30 , Matt Mathers Two senior lawyers warned Rishi Sunak that his draft Rwanda law “provides an easy” way for migrants to avoid deportation.The prime minister was told the scheme would be hit by legal challenges and at risk of failing, according to the Times.The paper reported that legal advice from a senior government lawyer warned “the scheme would be seriously impeded” if the bill did not include a so-called ­“ouster clause” that barred individual legal challenges.No timetable for Rwanda bill getting through parliamentFriday 8 December 2023 09:12 , Matt Mathers Legal migration minister Tom Pursglove was unable to offer a timetable for when the Rwanda legislation would get through parliament.Even if rushed through the Commons, it is expected to face serious opposition within the House of Lords.The minister told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “You’ve got to have consideration in both Houses of Parliament and that does take some time.“The whips and the leader of the house will come forward in terms of setting out a timetable by which we will seek to do this.“I want to see this legislation delivered as quickly as possible.”Olive branch as MPs offered chance to amend Rwanda billFriday 8 December 2023 08:40 , Matt Mathers Legal migration minister Tom Pursglove signalled that ministers could be open to compromises with rebel Tory MPs over Rishi Sunak’s contested Rwanda legislation,Archie Mitchellreports.It is an olive branch which means MPs could seek to make amendments to the bill after having voted for it, which could ease the scale of any rebellion over the plans.Mr Pursglove told Sky News: “There will be parliamentary debates, there will be opportunities for people to bring amendments, the House will consider them in the normal way and as ministers we will engage constructively with parliamentarians around any concerns that they have and handle that in the way that we would any other piece of legislation.”Sunak hit by ‘18 no confidence letters'Friday 8 December 2023 08:21 , Matt Mathers Eighteen Tories have reportedly submitted letters of no confidence in Rishi Sunak as the prime minister faces a civil war over his Rwanda deal.One rebel told the Daily Mirror they personally knew the names of 18 MPs who had already put in letters of no confidence -even before Robert Jenrick resigned as immigration minister.Sunak published a draft bill earlier this week which he claimed would fix the Rwanda deal but it has failed to satisfy both rightwingers and more moderate Tory MPs.Government minister defends cost of Rwanda dealFriday 8 December 2023 08:17 , Matt Mathers Legal migration minister Tom Pursglove has defended the cost of the Rwanda plan after it emerged the cost of the scheme has already reached £240 million.The newly appointed minister told Times Radio: “We’ve always been clear that this is an economic and migration partnership. We want to support economic development in Rwanda. And of course, there are quite understandably obligations on us to work with Rwanda to make sure that all of the right infrastructure to support the partnership is in place.“We are going about this work in a constructive way. Part of that money is helpful in making sure that we can respond to the issues properly that the Supreme Court raised, making sure that the capacity is in place to administer the partnership at the first possible opportunity.“And I think it’s right that we go about this in the way that we are and when you consider that we’re spending £8 million a day currently in the asylum system you have to look at those spends in that context. That is not sustainable.“And the Rwanda partnership is a key plank in our answer to getting those costs down.”Lord Cameron backs Rwanda dealFriday 8 December 2023 07:59 , Matt Mathers Foreign secretary Lord David Cameron expressed his support for Rishi Sunak over the prime minister’s Rwanda plan, branding it “the right package” despite opposition from hardline Tories.At a press conference during his trip to the US, he said: “Let me be clear, I support what the government is doing to deal with illegal migration… I think the prime minister has done a good job at coming up with the right package, a treaty with Rwanda that only a couple of weeks ago everyone thought would be impossible, it wouldn’t happen.“It has happened and it’s a very good treaty. A bill has been published and will be introduced to the House of Commons and a pack of evidence about the true nature of what happens in Rwanda is being put together. I’ve seen that myself and I think it’s very convincing and will overcome the arguments put in the Supreme Court.”ICYMI | Rishi Sunak pleads with Tory rebels: Back my Rwanda planFriday 8 December 2023 07:27 , Matt MathersRishi Sunak  isfighting to save his flagship Rwanda  policy – and his premiership – after a desperate defence of his new deportation bill failed to stop a growing revolt by Tory MPs on both sides of the party.

There has been one payment of £100 million, paid in April this year as part of the Economic Transformation and Integration Fund mentioned above.“The UK government has not paid any more to the government of Rwanda thus far. This was entirely separate to the treaty – the government of Rwanda did not ask for any payment in order for a treaty to be signed, nor was any offered.”Labour branded the revelation “incredible”, with shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper saying: “How many more blank cheques will Rishi Sunak write before the Tories come clean about this scheme being a total farce?“Britain simply can’t afford more of this costly chaos from the Conservatives.”Archie Mitchell reports: Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda plan has cost £290m -without a single flight taking off Sunak’s asylum plans a ‘dark day’ for Britain, warns YousafThursday 7 December 2023 15:30 , Matt Mathers The UK government’s immigration plans are a “real dark day” for the country, Scotland’s first minister said as he accused the prime minister of dismantling asylum processes.Humza Yousaf, whose grandfather came to Scotland from Pakistan in the 1960s to work in a sewing machine factory in Clydebank, addressed the issue during First Minister’s Questions on Thursday.It came as Scottish Conservative leader and Moray MP Douglas Ross told journalists in Holyrood he plans to back the UK Government’s Bill declaring Rwanda a safe destination for asylum seekers.Full report:Sunak’s asylum plans a ‘dark day’ for Britain, warns Yousaf ‘Completely ridiculous’ to replace Sunak, admits right-wing ToryThursday 7 December 2023 15:15 , Matt Mathers Some right-wingers have said the Rwanda bill could be “existential” for Rishi Sunak’s leadership.

We’ve just got to get the bill right.”Disappointed that the bill allows for legal challenges, he added: “I’m sure the bill is good enough to win through in the courts, but the problem is there are just endless delays so there won’t be any flights to Rwanda before the next election.”Dominic Cummings: Sunak’s position on Rwanda now ‘pure farce'Thursday 7 December 2023 15:05 , Matt Mathers Former No 10 strategist Dominic Cummings said Rishi Sunak’s position on Rwanda was now “pure farce”,Adam Forrest reports.“Sunak tells voters he can only bring in laws if *Rwanda* approves! great ammo for the ECHR campaign to come!” he said.Some rightwing Tories are calling for Mr Sunak to pull out of the ECHR but the PM has so far refused to do so.Moderate Conservatives say pulling out of the convention, which the UK helped to draft, would be a red line.pure farce -NPC-Sunak tells voters he can only bring in laws if *Rwanda* approves!great ammo for the ECHR campaign to come!#TakeBackControl pic.twitter.com/3ZcQ9AQgBZ — Dominic Cummings (@Dominic2306) December 7, 2023 ‘Insanity’ to have another leadership contest before general election -Tory chairThursday 7 December 2023 14:52 , Matt Mathers It would be “insanity” for the Tories to have another leadership contest before the next general election, the party’s chairman has said.Richard Holden, the Cabinet Office minister without portfolio, made the comment to journalists at a press gallery lunch in parliament.Mr Holden was promoted to the chair role in Mr Sunak’s reshuffle last month.Tory right to deliver verdict on Rwanda bill before Tuesday’s voteThursday 7 December 2023 14:45 , Matt Mathers One group of lawyers inspecting Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda legislation are expected to return their judgment to the Conservative Party’s right wing ahead of Tuesday’s vote.European Research Group chairman and MP Mark Francois said: “We all agree with the prime minister that we need to stop the boats but the legislation to do this must be assuredly fit for purpose.“To that end...spoke with Sir Bill Cash, who confirmed his star chamber team are already analysing the Rwanda Bill, in detail.“This may still take a few days to complete but he was confident their findings will be available, at the very latest, prior to the second reading debate on Tuesday.”Asylum seekers can still go to European court, says ex-government legal chiefThursday 7 December 2023 14:30 , Matt Mathers The respected Institute for Government think tank has shared analysis by Sir Jonathan Jones – the former government legal chief – who said the Rwanda bill would stop most legal challenges to deportations, but not all of them.And Mr Jones said asylum seekers would still be able to make claims to the European court in Strasbourg. He said Clause 4 allows claims to be made by asylum seekers “based on compelling evidence relating specifically to the person’s individual circumstances”.The legal expert said: “What the bill cannot do is prevent claimants going to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg if they have been unable to enforce their rights in the domestic courts.“The Strasbourg court would not be bound by the UK-Rwanda treaty or by the UK legislation. It would perform its own assessment, on the latest evidence available, as to whether there was a breach of the ECHR.”Sunak now almost as unpopular as Tory PartyThursday 7 December 2023 14:15 , Matt Mathers Rishi Sunak is now almost as unpopular as his party after a year of deteriorating polling numbers,Adam Forrest reports.Having entered Downing Street considerably more popular than the wider Conservative Party, 52 per cent of voters now say they have an unfavourable view of the prime minister, according to a poll published by Ipsos UK on Thursday.At the start of the year, 39 per cent of voters told Ipsos they had an unfavourable view of Mr Sunak, compared to 51 per cent saying the same about the Conservative Party.The figure for the wider party has barely changed, rising slightly to 54 per cent in November, while Mr Sunak’s favourability rating has collapsed.Keiran Pedley, director of politics at Ipsos, said: “A year of public concern about the cost of living, NHS and immigration now means Mr Sunak is almost as unpopular as the party he leads as he grapples with how to turn their collective fortune around in 2024.”One Nation Tories ‘very nervous’ about Rwanda billThursday 7 December 2023 14:02 , Matt Mathers Tories on the moderate One Nation wing of the party are “very nervous” about the implications of Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda legislation, a source in the group said,Adam Forrest reports.The group – which boasts about 100 MPs – has been discussing concerns including that courts cannot override the declaration of the bill that it is a safe country.The Conservative MPs are yet to have come to a conclusion after hearing the preliminary findings of former solicitor-general Lord Edward Garnier.Showdown vote on Rwanda bill will happen on TuesdayThursday 7 December 2023 13:52 , Matt Mathers Commons leader Penny Mordaunt has confirmed that Rishi Sunak’s emergency legislation will be debated by MPs for the first time next Tuesday,Adam Forrest reports.It means the first, all-important vote will happen then.

Rishi Sunak                      made a desperate bid to head off a growing revolt among right-wing Conservatives over his failed Rwanda flights plan with new emergency legislation that defies human rights law. Home secretary James Cleverly unveiled a bill in the Commons to “disapply” the UK Human Rights Act in a bid to stop British judges blocking the deportation of asylum seekers. In fresh turmoil, the Rwandan government immediately responded to the move by warning that it could pull out of the deal if the UK fails to comply with international law. Sunak tries to stop Tory revolt with new Rwanda bill, as Braverman hits out at plans                      Braverman: ‘Sorry truth’ is that new legislation ‘won’t work'                    Suella Braverman, the former home secretary, has been speaking to broadcasters this morning after telling Rishi Sunak he faces “electoral oblivion” as she claimed his Rwanda plan was doomed to fail. In an interview with the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Ms Braverman said the “sorry truth” is that new legislation to revive the strategy to stop small boats “won’t work”.  “There are elements that should be welcomed in this new bill that the prime minister has presented,” she said. “But taken as a whole and looking at the reality of the challenges that are involved in detaining people, removing people and getting them to Rwanda – this is a very litigious field and there are lots of legal frameworks that apply – the reality is and the sorry truth is that it won’t work and it will not stop the boats.”                      Thursday 7 December 2023 08:22 , Matt Mathers Good morning and welcome to The Independent’s live politics coverage as Rishi Sunak comes under fresh pressure over his Rwanda plan.
