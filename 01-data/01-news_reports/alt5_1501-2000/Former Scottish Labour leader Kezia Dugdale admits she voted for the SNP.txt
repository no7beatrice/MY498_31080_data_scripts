   Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale admits she voted for the SNP dailyrecord.co.uk February 5, 2024 Monday 4:30 AM GMT  Copyright 2024 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 525 words Byline: By, Chris McCall Highlight: Dugdale claimed her decision to back the Nationalists in 2019 was a one-off protest vote over Labour's position on Brexit. Body   Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has admitted she once voted for the SNP. The ex-MSP claimed her decision to back the Nationalists at the 2019 European Parliament elections was a one-off protest vote over her party's stance on Brexit.                       Dugdale insisted she had voted for Labour in every election since then. In a BBC Radio 4 documentary on the coming general election battle in Scotland, she said she was "so mad" over Brexit. "I voted SNP once in my life and that was in the European Union elections immediately after Brexit, where I was so mad about Brexit, I wanted to register to register a vote for them," Dugdale said. "I felt I could vote for the SNP in that European Union election, because that in no way could be construed as a vote for independence. "I felt that that was a safe thing to do. I voted Labour in every election since then, from the council to the Scottish Parliament, to the general election, I have used a vote for Labour." The former Scottish Labour leader, who is no longer a party member, is married to SNP Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth. Dugdale previously said her stance on independence had "moved" as she could no longer argue as strongly for the union as she did in 2014, but was not necessarily ready to vote Yes in a referendum. The BBC documentary also spoke to current Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, who said he believes 28 Scottish seats are "in play" at the general election. He said: "People talk a lot about tipping points in the polls. I think the tipping point in Scotland is around 35 per cent - if we get around 35 per cent in the polls then we are in competition to beat the SNP. "If I said that to anybody two-and-a-bit years ago, they would have thought I was deluded. But I have always believed that's what we can do." Reacting to Dugdale's admission, SNP MP Alyn Smith claimed Labour's position on Europe was "totally bankrupt". "Brexit has been an unmitigated disaster," he said. "Despite voting overwhelmingly to remain, Scots are paying the price for Brexit with higher bills, soaring food prices and a cost of living crisis that's hammering household incomes. "Labour's position on Europe is totally bankrupt - so much so their former leader in Scotland backed the SNP as the only pro-EU party in the UK. "The SNP remains the only party committed to re-joining the EU and the world's largest single market. "While Labour are willing to disregard Scotland and ignore the total chaos Brexit has unfolded on our economy - the SNP will always stand up for Scotland's values, remaining firmly committed to a better future as an independent nation inside the EU." A spokesperson for Scottish Labour said: "There is an overwhelming majority in Scotland and across the UK for change. "That means Scotland can lead the way in getting rid of the Tories and maximising Scotland's influence in the UK. "So, our message to all voters is the same - we don't care how you voted in the past. "We are the only party in this country trying to persuade anyone and to unify it around change."
