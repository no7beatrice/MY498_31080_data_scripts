   ITV I'm A Celebrity's Fred Sirieix called a 'b*****d' by Strictly star after Brexit row mirror.co.uk November 22, 2023 Wednesday 10:31 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: TV NEWS; Version:2 Length: 549 words Byline: By, Lucretia Munro Highlight: Ex-Strictly Come Dancing star James Jordan has hit out at ITV I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here's Fred Sirieix after row with Nigel Farage over Brexit and called him a 'b****d' Body                        I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here star Fred Sirieix has been branded a "bd" by Strictly Come Dancing's James Jordan following his heated discussion with Nigel Farage over Brexit.  Fred, 51, who became well known to the British public during his stint in the E4 show First Dates, decided to raise the subject of Brexit with the former UKIP leader. As Farage, 59, was a staunch campaigner for Britain to leave the European Union and Fred's views are known to be the complete opposite, it was never going to be a calm debate. And even hosts Ant and Dec were gobsmacked that Fred decided to raise the debate on day two of the show. Earlier this week, Fred asked the former politician: "What is the benefit of Brexit then" If you are an average person from Britain, what's the benefit" Farage then replied: "To know that we're independent, we stand on our own two feet in the world." But Fred seemed keen to get his point across. He then responded: "Brexit was about immigration, I remember your poster. I thought it was shameful what you did, Nigel. Shameful." Unwilling to back down Farage then added: "Sadly, sadly it was absolutely true. It was a poster showing mass young men moving illegally across borders." Fred accused him of using the image of migrants moving across borders to demonise them, leaving the British public to believe that Brexit would put an end to it all. After the episode aired, James took to X, formerly known as Twitter and wrote: "Fred is a bd." The French star has made no secret of the fact that he felt it was wrong for Britain to Brexit as after 30 years of living in the UK, he was then forced to apply for "settled status", to remain in the country. During an appearance on Loose Women, Fred told the panel and viewers: "I remember coming here, being a foreigner but never feeling a foreigner. But I remember my daughter, who was 11 at the time, saying, 'Daddy, do we have to leave' I have to apply for my settled status or the unsettling status as I call it. I don't believe in the idea." He firmly believes that he doesn't think it's "going to be good for the country" and thinks that the UK will be "poorer as a result." Fred's decision to speak about Brexit with Farage on the second day of the show, has left many viewers wondering if he had a game plan. And it was only recently that body language expert Judi James exposed him for pretending to have a fear of heights. Speaking of the benefits of showing a fear, Judi told Paddy Power Games: "Celebrities often gain votes by acting fearful during the first few days of the show. Fear responses get them more camera time and they make the viewers laugh." She added that it can be a useful tool to "gain sympathy" from the public. In particular, she said that Fred was acting scared and his actions were inauthentic unlike with Danielle. She added: "The biggest fear-faker last night seemed to be Fred. His 'I'm scared of everything' looked incongruent thanks to his strong eye contact to camera and his relaxed, asymmetric grin. He said the line with a hand gesture of evaluation as though measuring and working out the best lines to help him be the star of the show."
