   'Obsessive' Humza Yousaf insists he will continue push for Scottish independence even if the SNP is hammered in the general election as he insists there is an 'urgent' need to quit 'broken, Brexit Britain' MailOnline January 12, 2024 Friday 2:51 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 739 words Byline: David Wilcock, Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline Body                        SNP leader Humza Yousaf was accused of 'obsessing' over Scottish independence at the expense of problems facing its people today. The First Minister vowed to continue for Scotland to leave the UK and rejoin the EU 'regardless' of how the party does at the next general election. He made the remarks ahead of a speech today in which he said that Scotland had to quit 'broken, Brexit Britain' for its own good. But his priorities were questioned after the speech, in which he mentioned independence and Brexit five times each, but the NHS only twice. Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: 'This is further confirmation that the SNP plans to speak about independence and little else as we come into this General Election year.  'There are a range of challenges facing Scotland right now, most of which have been worsened by the SNP's lamentable 16 years in power. People want politicians to debate the things that really matter.  'Instead, Humza Yousaf intends to drive up grievance and spend the foreseeable future obsessing publicly about his desire to break up Britain.'  The SNP leader and Scottish First Minister was addressing comments made by his own senior MP Tommy Sheppard, who said independence will be hindered if the party fails to retain the majority of seats in Scotland. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Yousaf said: 'Tommy Sheppard is not wrong in saying, of course, that if the message in Scotland is that Scotland votes for Labour MPs, and if that is the message that Keir Starmer sees, then of course that will take our independence backwards.' Asked directly if the debate on independence will stop if the party fails to win the most seats, Mr Yousaf said: 'No. The SNP will never stop campaigning for independence. 'It hasn't stopped campaigning in its almost 90 years of existence, and it will continue to campaign for independence regardless of what the election results are, regardless of how many seats we have in any Parliament.' He acknowledged the independence movement will have a 'more difficult' challenge without SNP MPs at Westminster. His party is looking to again win a majority of seats in Scotland, with the aim of giving 'democratic effect to Scotland becoming an independent country', he said. The comments came as Mr Yousaf launched the SNP's general election campaign later on Friday, targeting all Conservative seats in Scotland. After a brutal year for the nationalists the First Minister insisted the SNP can take the six Westminster seats held by Douglas Ross's party in 2019. Opinion polls suggest he will lose seats and the SNP may lose its crown as Scotland's largest party at Westminster. At the last general election, the SNP won 48 out of 59 Scottish seats. But polling analysts have said it faces a challenge from Labour north of the border. In October the pro-independence party lost a by-election race in Rutherglen and Hamilton West, overturning a previous SNP majority of more than 5,000. A Scottish resurgence is seen as key to Labour beating the Tories UK-wide and putting Sir Keir Starmer in No10. Last year, the SNP conference backed the First Minister's motion calling for immediate negotiations with Westminster 'to give democratic effect to Scotland becoming an independent country' if the party wins a majority of seats north of the border. In his speech on Friday, Mr Yousaf attacked Brexit and its impact on the Scottish economy, saying only his party will ensure Scotland's voice is heard at Westminster. 'Let us get out there and take our message to every doorstep, that there is a better alternative to the misery of broken, Brexit Britain,' he said. 'There is hope, as an independent nation, taking her rightful place in the European Union. So let us get out there and win this election - and make Scotland a better nation.' Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said: 'The Scottish public are sick and tired of the independence-obsessed SNP ignoring their real priorities, such as the economy and Scotland's ailing public services, and trying to turn the next election into a de facto referendum on separation. 'Voters know that the only way to shift the focus on to the issues that matter to them - and shut the door on Humza Yousaf's independence plan for good - is to unseat SNP MPs. 'As Humza Yousaf points out, in swathes of constituencies across the country, only the Scottish Conservatives can do that.' Load-Date: January 12, 2024  End of Document
