   Brexit's legacy of damage; Letters East Anglian Daily Times November 27, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 22 Length: 219 words Body   ROBERT Newson in his letter of November 23 in my view trivialises the consequences of the departure of the UK from a unity of European nations. He is wrong - in 50 years' time we will not be still talking and writing about the consequences of Brexit. We will be long gone. It will be our grandchildren who are not able to work or study in Europe. Who are not involved in European initiatives and projects and policies. Who will have no place within the co-operative and peaceful endeavours and creativity of what could by then be over 40 nations of differing but united human beings. We will not be here in 50 years time. But millions of disenfranchised young people will look at our generation and ask WHY and how did we allow them to be denied the right to play a part within a unity of European nations? The answer is, because we allowed ourselves to be taken out of this great peaceful European endeavour by (mostly English) myopic nationalists. At that critical time we even denied the young people, who were to suffer the consequences, the right to vote. I believe we should be hanging our heads in shame for being sucked into Brexit by a tapestry of lies. Brexit damaged our nation and damaged our European neighbours. The shameful consequences of Brexit will last way beyond 50 years. MARTIN DEIGHTON, Woodbridge. Load-Date: November 27, 2023  End of Document
