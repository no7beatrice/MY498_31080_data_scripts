   Landowners accuse Mark Drakeford of having a 'long-standing disrespect towards rural Wales' amid Labour First Minister's furious bust-up with farmers over post-Brexit subsidies MailOnline February 22, 2024 Thursday 5:06 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 667 words Byline: David Wilcock, Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline Body   Mark Drakeford has been accused of harbouring 'long-standing disrespect towards rural Wales' amid a deepening row between the Labour First Minister and farmers. The Country Land and Business Association (CLA) leader in Wales accused him of governing for 'just the industrial and urban parts' of the country after he clashed with agriculturists over subsidies. Wales has been struck by a series of protests by farmers over Labour's plans for a replacement for EU subsidy schemes, which involve them planting trees on 10 per cent of their land in exchange for handouts. On Tuesday he suggested farmers were responsible for their won problems, because many of them voted in favour of Brexit, which meant they lost access to EU payments.  The Labour politician then appeared to say hundreds who turned up at a visit to a college in north Wales on Wednesday had 'nothing better to do', in footage published by the local newspaper. The CLA Welsh director, Victoria Bond said: 'This is not Brexit's fault. It's Mark Drakeford's fault. His comments are deeply disrespectful and typify his long-standing disrespect towards rural Wales.  'In England the new agricultural schemes are bedding in well, not withstanding obvious teething problems that are only natural for such a big change. English schemes have proven that a more environmentally friendly agriculture policy can work if there is constant collaboration between government and industry. By falsely Brexit, Mr Drakeford is seeking to avoid scrutiny of his failure to competently design similar schemes.  'I strongly encourage the next first minister to reset the relationship, and promise to govern for all of Wales not just the industrial and urban parts.  As many as 200 people flocked to Coleg Llandrillo on Wednesday, as part of a long-running row over changes to post-Brexit farm subsidies.                                              RISHI SUNAK: Wales is proof that when Labour run something, they run it badly                                         The Rhyl Journal later published footage showing Mr Drakeford, who steps down in three weeks, discussing the protest inside. After being asked if it was ''nice to get past the tractors', he seemed to be heard replying: 'Nothing better to do, apparently.'  Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives said: 'Mark Drakeford has repeatedly shown his naked contempt for our farmers. 'Labour's anti-farmer policies will destroy agricultural communities in Wales, and will do the same to England if Keir Starmer ever gets the keys to Number 10. 'Metropolitan politicians should listen to our rural communities and work with them rather than ignoring their concerns, because no farmers means no food.' It came as a contender to become Labour's next Welsh First Minister was embroiled in a 'dirty money' row after pocketing a £200,000 donation from a convicted polluter who dumped waste on a conservation site. Vaughan Gething, one of two candidates bidding to take over from Mr Drakeford, has vowed to introduce tougher penalties for those who break environmental rules. But he was yesterday slammed by supporters of his rival, Jeremy Miles, over the 'unjustifiable and wrong' decision to accept two donations from a firm run by businessman David Neal. Mr Neal, 63, was prosecuted in 2013 for illegally dumping waste at a conservation site on the Gwent Levels, near the Severn Estuary, after toxic liquid had leaked into the water. Four years later he was prosecuted for again failing to remove the waste. On both occasions he was given a suspended prison sentence. The row came as Rishi Sunak prepared to address the Welsh Conservative conference.                      Writing in the Daily Mail today, the Prime Minister says Labour's record in Wales 'is proof that when Labour run something, they run it badly'. Mr Sunak highlights Sir Keir Starmer's boast that the Cardiff administration would be his 'blueprint' for governing Britain. He added: 'I am sorry that people in Wales are in Labour's laboratory.'
