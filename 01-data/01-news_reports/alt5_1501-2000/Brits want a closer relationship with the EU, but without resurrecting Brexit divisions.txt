   Brits want a closer relationship with the EU, but without resurrecting Brexit divisions CE Noticias Financieras English December 9, 2023 Saturday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

As a consequence, there is a growing desire to forge a good relationship with the EU based on pragmatism, which avoids the possibility of plunging back into an aggressive national debate. A majority of citizens (52%) would like the UK to have a closer relationship with the EU, according to the poll conducted by Focaldata for the British Future organization. It is one of the largest and most comprehensive studies to date on the evolution of British attitudes on the issue that has shaped an entire generation. Beyond Brexit; Public Perspectives on the Future UK-EU Relationship worked on a sample of 2,027 citizens polled across the country between June 29 and July 11, as well as 12 focus groups (focus groups, in which citizens of different attitudes are selected to hear how they debate each other) in London, Manchester and Peterborough, one of the cities with the strongest support for Brexit in the 2016 referendum. The EU before the U.S. The desire to strengthen UK-EU relations from a practical point of view is far ahead of the desire to strengthen the transatlantic relationship with the United States, as promised for years by Euroskeptics. Some 50% of those polled consider closeness with Brussels more important for peace, stability and prosperity than with Washington (26%) or with any of the Commonwealth countries, which account for 27%. Support for greater collaboration on matters such as the fight against international crime and terrorism (68%), better trade relations (61%), closer cooperation in science and research (61%), defense (57%), the fight against climate change (56%) or the defense of human rights (50%) suggest, according to the report, that the British have put aside the emotional component that Brexit brought with it to prioritize a more pragmatic component. "There is clear pragmatic support among British citizens toward greater cooperation with our EU neighbors. But people do not feel European, and mutual interests - the fight against terrorism or against climate change, for example - are more attractive to respondents than the idea of supposedly shared values or principles," explains Heather Rolfe, director of British Future Studies and one of the authors of the study. The Labour Party's strategy The study endorses the strategy pushed in recent years by Labour opposition leader Keir Starmer and his team: the promise of greater collaboration and a better relationship with the EU, but without resurrecting ideas that still carry the threat of social division such as re-entry into the European Union, or its internal market or shared customs area. "Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves [Labour's Economy spokeswoman and potential minister] have long championed the idea of resetting the relationship with the EU. People are willing to give them space and permission to pursue that pragmatic increase in cooperation, even if it's not quite clear that that appetite also exists in Brussels at the moment," says Sunder Katwala, director of British Future. Less than 9% of respondents identified themselves as "European" in the survey, and the figure was even lower among those from ethnic minorities. There is also a broad consensus on the fear of resurrecting the years of controversy surrounding Brexit. Some 59% of respondents want the future debate about the relationship with the EU to be much less heated. It is a desire shared among both Labour (68%) and Conservative (61%) voters, and among both Brexit supporters (56%) and those in favor of remaining in the European Union (76%). However, with the mood calmed and the general feeling that the debate is behind us, it is striking in the survey that 49% of those consulted now believe it was a mistake to leave the EU. Thirty-six percent defend the decision. 15% do not know how to respond.
