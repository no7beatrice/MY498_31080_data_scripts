   Lord Kinnock leads backlash against Starmer over Tory defection telegraph.co.uk May 8, 2024 Wednesday 5:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:5 Length: 8782 words Byline: By Daniel Martin, Deputy Political Editor and Ben Riley-Smith, Political Editor and Dominic Penna, Political Correspondent and Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor Body   Sir Keir Starmer faced a backlash from the Left wing of his party after welcoming defecting Tory MP Natalie Elphicke to the Labour benches. The MP for Dover, who was on the pro-Brexit Right of the Conservative Party, crossed the floor of the House just before Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday at noon. She said she had left the party because the country needed to “move on from the broken promises of Rishi Sunak’s tired and chaotic Government”. She said she was angry that Boris Johnson had been ousted by the Conservatives and that, under Mr Sunak, the party had become a “byword for incompetence and division”. But Left-wing Labour members and MPs expressed anger that Sir Keir had opened the political door to an MP who had called for stringent curbs on immigration, vocally backed the Rwanda scheme and criticised Marcus Rashford for missing a penalty in the Euro 2020 finals. Mrs Elphicke wrote in an MPs’ group that the footballer should have spent more time “perfecting his game” rather than “playing politics”. Mish Rahman, a Left-wing member of Labour’s ruling NEC, tweeted: “This is an absolute disgrace and a new low for Starmer. “Is Starmer’s Labour now a safe haven for any defecting racist Tory who wants to stop the boats, more Rwanda flights and join in with the abuse of black England players after missing a penalty?” Lord Kinnock, the former Labour leader, told BBC Radio 4’s Week in Westminster: “I think we have got to be choosy to a degree about who we allow to join our party because it’s a very broad church but churches have walls and there are limits. “Mrs Elphicke has got to decide whether she is committed to the programme and principles of the Labour Party, broadly defined, generously defined with great liberal intentions, but we are a political party and not a debating club.” John McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, told LBC that he was shocked by Sir Keir’s decision. “It certainly is a stunt that damages the Tories, there’s no doubt about that. But it also has implications for the Labour Party as well, because of the views that Natalie Elphicke has expressed in the past, some of which I don’t think the party should be associated with,” he said. James Schneider, Jeremy Corbyn’s former director of communications, said: “It shows there is no principle on the back of the membership card that Keir Starmer won’t trample over in his rush to be indistinguishable from the Tories. “On all the major issues, Britain is now a one-party state; but with our traditional British eccentricity we have two of them.” Labour MP Mick Whitley said: “Natalie Elphicke’s values are not the values of the Labour movement. “It’s outrageous that she should be allowed to join the Labour benches while principled socialists like Diane Abbott and Jeremy Corbyn still haven’t had the whip restored.” Another MP on the Left of the party said: “Natalie Elphicke is not a socialist. She is not even a social democrat. She’s a Tory through and through. What next? Would they accept Jacob Rees-Mogg? That would be good for putting the boot into the Tories, but does it make Labour more stable? “The fact that I can’t decide whether Keir would welcome Nigel Farage tells you all you need to know.” A spokesman for Momentum, the Left-wing campaigning group, said: “Natalie Elphicke has consistently demonised refugees and aid groups. She voted against Labour proposals to outlaw fire and rehire while supporting a wide array of destructive and damaging Tory legislation. She should have no place in a Labour Party committed to progressive values and working-class people.” Mrs Elphicke sat just behind Sir Keir during PMQs as the Labour leader faced Mr Sunak. The defection means the Conservative majority in the Commons is now down to 38 after Mr Johnson won with a majority of 80 in 2019. A week ago Dan Poulter also left the Conservatives to join Labour. It has been reported that half a dozen other Tories are considering crossing the floor. Mrs Elphicke was elected as the Dover MP in 2019, having taken over the seat from her then husband, Charles, who was facing sexual harassment charges. A Labour spokesman said Mrs Elphicke would be stepping down at the election and Mike Tapp, the already selected Dover candidate, would stand for the party. On Wednesday Mrs Elphicke said: “When I was elected in 2019, the Conservative Party occupied the centre ground of British politics. The party was about building the future and making the most of the opportunities that lay ahead for our country. “Since then many things have changed. The elected prime minister was ousted in a coup led by the unelected Rishi Sunak. Under Rishi Sunak, the Conservatives have become a byword for incompetence and division. The centre ground has been abandoned and key pledges of the 2019 manifesto have been ditched. “It’s time for change. Time for a Labour government led by Keir Starmer. The general election cannot come soon enough.” Mrs Elphicke added that she had decided to join Labour because of its pro-housing policies, saying the party now “occupies the centre ground of British politics”. She added: “Most significantly for me, the modern Labour Party looks to the future, to building a Britain of hope, optimism, opportunity and fairness, a Britain everyone can be part of.”                      Attacked Labour’s agenda in the past                    A spokesman for Sir Keir denied she would be given a peerage in order to serve, and said Mrs Elphicke would be working with the leadership on its housing policy. Mrs Elphicke has attacked Labour’s agenda in the past. In 2022 she wrote on social media: “If Labour’s only policy is to rely on the French, then they are not serious about stopping small boats, tackling criminality, protecting people from the smuggling gangs or saving lives in the Channel.” She also said a “muddled and confused” performance by Sir Keir at PMQs was “a strong reminder that all the opposition offer is a Lib/Lab/SNP coalition of chaos that would take our country backwards on Brexit and break up the United Kingdom”. Her defection has been criticised by Tories. In a post on X, MP Andrea Jenkyns questioned why Mrs Elphicke had decided to join “the lefty Labour lot”. Local Tories insisted they were glad to see the back of her. Cllr Oliver Richardson, the Conservative member for the Guston, Kingsdown and St Margaret’s-at-Cliffe ward on Dover District council, said: “I think that Natalie’s let us down and she’s a complete turncoat.” But Cllr Gordon Cowan, the chairman of the council and Labour member for the St Radigunds ward, said: “It was her choice – she decided to cross the floor, that was her decision. “It’s always a good sign that people want to join Labour and the party and Natalie Elphicke is no different than a normal person in the street who wants to join Labour.”                      You can follow the latest updates below and join the conversation in the comments section                      here                      .                                          08 May 2024-03:59PM GMT                                         That’s all for today...                    Thank you for joining our coverage of another dramatic day in Westminster as Natalie Elphicke defected from the Conservatives to Labour moments before Prime Minister’s Questions in a further blow for Rishi Sunak. My colleague Jack Maidment will be back tomorrow to guide you through another day.                      08 May 2024-03:48PM GMT                                         Labour must be ‘choosy’ about who it admits, says Lord Kinnock                    Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock has spoken to our Political Editor Ben Riley-Smith for BBC Radio 4’s The Week in Westminster. Asked about Natalie Elphicke’s defection to Labour, the peer said: “The first question is how will she fare and how will she show commitment to her constituency over the remaining months to the general election. That’s up to her and up to them to reflect. “As far the party is concerned more generally, I think we have got to be choosy to a degree about who we allow to join our party because it’s a very broad church but churches have walls and there are limits. “Ms Elphicke has got to decide whether she is committed to the programme and principles of the Labour Party, broadly defined, generously defined with great liberal intentions, but we are a political party and not a debating club.”                      08 May 2024-03:44PM GMT                                         Elphicke’s defection ‘would have made John the Baptist blush’                    Natalie Elphicke’s defection to Labour “would have strained the generosity of spirit of John the Baptist”, a former shadow chancellor has said. John McDonnell, who was Jeremy Corbyn’s right-hand man, told LBC: ‘I’m surprised and shocked like many people. I’m a great believer in the powers of conversion, but I think even this one would have strained the generosity of spirit of John the Baptist, quite honestly… “It certainly is a stunt that damages the Tories, there’s no doubt about that. “But it also has implications for the Labour Party as well because of the views that Natalie Elphicke has expressed in the past, and some of which I don’t think the party should be associated with.”                      08 May 2024-03:35PM GMT                                         ‘A new low for Starmer’                    A member of Labour’s National Executive Committee (NEC) has called Natalie Elphicke’s defection from the Conservatives “a new low for Starmer”. Mish Rahman, who is on the Left of the party, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: “This is an absolute disgrace and a new low for Starmer.” He suggested Sir Keir’s party had become a “safe haven” for MPs wanting to “stop the boats, more Rwanda flights and join in with the abuse of black England players after missing a penalty”. Ms Elphicke had criticised Marcus Rashford after he missed a crucial spot kick in the Euro 2020 final, telling colleagues: “They lost – would it be ungenerous to say Rashford should have spent more time perfecting his game and less time playing politics.” She later apologised for the message and said she regretted her “rash reaction”.                      08 May 2024-03:14PM GMT                                         Oxford University head of equality faces calls to quit                    Oxford dons have called for the university’s head of equality to resign after he signed an open letter in support of a pro-Palestinian protest camp at the university. Vernal Scott, who has led Oxford’s equality and diversity unit since October 2023, has put his name to a letter declaring solidarity with students protesting against Israel’s war in Gaza. The demonstrators set up tents on the lawn of the university’s Pitt Rivers Museum on Monday and have said they will not leave until the university meets their demands, which include cutting financial ties with companies linked to Israel, and calling for an immediate ceasefire. Mr Scott last month celebrated the closure of the National Conservatism Conference by police in Brussels, which prompted accusations of double standards from Oxford dons.

Kate Osamor, the MP for Edmonton, was suspended by the party in January following a backlash to her “amoral” and “offensive” remarks from Jewish leaders. A Labour Party spokesman said: “The Chief Whip has today restored the Labour whip to Kate Osamor MP. This follows a full investigation by the Labour Party into complaints received about a social media post she made in January.”Ms Osamor MP said: “I am grateful to the Labour Party for their investigation into my conduct and I accept the outcome in full.“I want to unreservedly apologise again for my comments. I made remarks which were insensitive, inappropriate, and which I apologise for and regret. I will continue to reach out to Jewish stakeholders and the community.” She added she was “committed to ensuring that I don’t fall short of the highest standards” and looked forward to representing her constituents.                      08 May 2024-02:39PM GMT                                         Elphicke criticised Labour over small boats, cost of living and Ulez                    Natalie Elphicke has been a vocal critic of Labour in the past, having taken aim at the party over its stance on a number of issues.  Writing in The Express in April 2023, she accused Labour of trying to “undermine” the Government’s efforts to stop small boat Channel crossings. She said Labour had proposed amendments to migration legislation “that would make it more difficult to detain and remove illegal migrants”.  She wrote: “This shows, yet again, that not only have Labour got no plan of their own to tackle illegal immigration, they simply do not want to.” In September 2022 she criticised Labour’s response to the cost of living crisis. She tweeted: “Labour’s solution to tackle the cost of living? Grabbing more in taxes from the pockets of millions of hardworking British people. Same old Labour.” Ms Elphicke has also spoken out over the expansion of the Ulez charge, describing it in January 2023 as “Labour London’s expensive car tax”.                       08 May 2024-02:34PM GMT                                         Telegraph readers give their verdict on Elphicke defection                    Natalie Elphicke’s defection to the Labour Party stunned Westminster at lunchtime.  The Dover MP’s decision has prompted much debate among Telegraph readers in the comments section of today’s politics live blog.  Here is a selection of the comments:                       08 May 2024-02:18PM GMT                                         Labour declines to say if Farage would be welcome in party                    Labour has declined to say whether Nigel Farage would be welcome in the Labour Party, writes Dominic Penna.  Sir Keir Starmer’s official spokesman was asked this afternoon whether the party would open its arms to the former Ukip leader following the defection of Natalie Elphicke, who was widely seen as being on the Right of the Conservative Party. Sir Keir’s spokesman replied: “Of course we have conversations with all sorts of people who talk to us about wanting to come and support the party in various different ways. “Those conversations happen every time before we move forward with any decision about anyone.”                      08 May 2024-02:16PM GMT                                         Pictured: Angus Robertson arrives at Bute House as John Swinney appoints Cabinet                                         08 May 2024-02:14PM GMT                                         Labour’s Dover candidate welcomes Elphicke’s defection                    Mike Tapp, the Labour candidate in Dover at the next election, welcomed Natalie Elphicke’s defection.  Ms Elphicke, the current MP for Dover, will stand down at the next general election and Mr Tapp will remain the Labour candidate in the constituency.  Mr Tapp told The Mirror: “No one is happier than me when someone is persuaded to come over to the Labour cause.”                      08 May 2024-02:03PM GMT                                         Elphicke could take on Labour role on housing policy                    Natalie Elphicke could take on an unpaid role working on housing policy with Labour, a spokesman for Sir Keir Starmer has said. He denied that the ex-Tory MP was offered a peerage or job in return for her defection. “We have talked about her doing a role building on her experience in housing policy,” the spokesman said.                      08 May 2024-01:50PM GMT                                         Labour MP takes swipe at Starmer over Elphicke meeting                    Labour MP Rosie Duffield, who claims she has been sidelined by Sir Keir Starmer over her refusal to buy into trans ideology, contrasted the way she and Natalie Elphicke had been treated by the party leadership. Responding to a picture of the new Labour MP for Dover holding a meeting with Sir Keir today, she tweeted: “Well, at least one woman from Kent got a meeting!” Ms Duffield is MP for Canterbury in Kent, but says she has not had a meeting with Sir Keir since she started speaking out on women’s rights.                      08 May 2024-01:33PM GMT                                         Labour backbencher labels Elphicke defection a ‘f------joke’                    One Labour MP told The Telegraph that Natalie Elphicke’s defection had been poorly received by some backbenchers.  They told The Telegraph: “It’s a f------joke. That’s about all I’ve got to say about it.  “It very much seems to have gone down like a cup of hot sick in the PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party].”                      08 May 2024-01:28PM GMT                                         Labour MP: Tory defections could destabilise party                    One Labour MP on the left of the party suggested accepting right-wing Tory defectors was “not sustainable”.  They told The Telegraph that Natalie Elphicke was “not a socialist” but a “Tory through and through”.  They said: “I get this in terms of damaging the Conservatives, but in terms of building a political project-it is not sustainable. “Natalie Elphicke is not a socialist, she is not even a social democrat. She’s a Tory through and through. “What next? Would they accept Jacob Rees-Mogg? That would be good for putting the boot into the Tories, but does it make Labour more stable? “The fact that I can’t decide whether Keir would welcome Nigel Farage tells you all you need to know.”                      08 May 2024-01:15PM GMT                                         Elphicke defection ‘lacks credibility’, claims minister                    Huw Merriman said he believed no one would take Natalie Elphicke’s defection to the Labour Party “seriously”.  The rail minister told Sky News: “She [Ms Elphicke] has castigated Labour and Labour MPs in the chamber, I have been there, for not voting for our Rwanda plan and for not backing attempts to control immigration which I as a fellow south coast MP support.  “So for her to be sat there with them now just lacks credibility and I don’t think anyone will take this at all seriously.”                      08 May 2024-12:59PM GMT                                         Minister claims Elphicke ‘betrayed her principles’ with switch to Labour                    A Tory minister suggested Natalie Elphicke had betrayed her principles as he criticised her decision to defect to Labour.  Huw Merriman, the rail minister, described the move by the MP for Dover as a “career opportunist turn”.  He told Sky News: “I am really taken aback by Natalie’s decision because I think it is fair to say she has always been on the right of our party and she has always been outspoken, particularly on immigration and Labour’s policies on immigration.  “She has written for the Daily Mail, The Express, and so for her to be sat there with the Labour Party just shows a real career opportunist turn from her.  “But also that Labour don’t seem to have a set of principles either. So I was really, genuinely staggered by that. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. “I am sorry also for what it does to politics because people will not trust politicians if we betray our principles when we look at the opinion polls. “                      08 May 2024-12:48PM GMT                                         Sunak not changing course on immigration plan, says No 10                    The Prime Minister will not change course on immigration policies following Natalie Elphicke’s defection to Labour over the issue, Downing Street said. Asked the question, Rishi Sunak’s press secretary said: “No, we are going forward with [our plans to tackle illegal immigration].” She brushed off questions on whether Mr Sunak was concerned about the second Tory defection in recent weeks, saying he was focused on “the priorities of the British people”. The press secretary said she hoped Ms Elphicke would explain why she changed her mind on Labour’s policies after being “very forthright in attacking ‘Sir Softie’ Starmer, Labour’s open-borders policy”.                      08 May 2024-12:34PM GMT                                         Swinney appoints Forbes as Deputy First Minister of Scotland                    John Swinney has appointed Kate Forbes the new Deputy First Minister of Scotland after she agreed not to stand against him for the SNP leadership, writes Simon Johnson, The Telegraph’s Scottish political editor.  Ms Forbes said she was “deeply honoured” to be given the role, which indicates that Mr Swinney is serious about trying to drag his party back to the political centre ground after the end of its coalition with the Scottish Greens.                      08 May 2024-12:32PM GMT                                         Britain to expel Russian defence attache                    Britain is to expel the Russian defence attache following an increase in malign activity by the state in the UK and Europe, the Home Secretary has announced. In a Commons statement, James Cleverly said the attache was being expelled as an undeclared military intelligence officer under powers in the Government’s new security legislation.

Speaking in his parliamentary office after PMQs, Sir Keir said: “I’m delighted to welcome Natalie Elphicke to the Labour Party. She’s got a strong track record on issues such as housing, she’s on the frontline when it comes to the crisis of small boats. “And the reason that she’s given for joining the Labour Party is very, very important because I think she speaks for very many Tory voters in saying that the Tory Party has changed, it’s left the centre ground. “But equally the Labour Party has changed and we are pretty clearly the party of the national interest, of country first, party second.  “And I look forward to working with her on the mission to deliver the real change that this country desperately needs.” Asked if more Conservatives MPs could defect, he sidestepped the question but said: “I think there are very many Tory voters who genuinely feel that the party that they may have voted for – many, many times in some cases – is no longer the Tory Party that they see. “And I say to every Tory voter who feels that they want to be part of a national mission to change our country for the better that the project we’ve built here in this changed Labour Party is a project that I hope they would feel they could get behind.”                      08 May 2024-12:23PM GMT                                         Elphicke was talking to Labour about defection before local elections                    Natalie Elphicke was talking about defecting to Labour before the local elections last Thursday, The Telegraph understands. It means that her decision to cross the aisle and switch from a Tory to Labour MP was on the cards well before the scale of Tory defeats was apparent, reveals Ben Riley-Smith, The Telegraphs’ political editor.  The news was so tightly held that just around half a dozen figures around Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, were in the loop.  Labour’s press team was only told about the news two minutes before Prime Minister’s Questions, meaning just moments before it broke publicly.                       08 May 2024-12:21PM GMT                                         Momentum blasts Starmer over decision to welcome Elphicke                    Momentum, a campaign group on the left of the Labour Party, said Sir Keir Starmer’s willingness to welcome Natalie Elphicke into the party showed that he had moved it too far to the right. A spokesman for the group said: “Natalie Elphicke has consistently demonised refugees and aid groups.  “She voted against Labour proposals to outlaw fire and rehire, while supporting a wide array of destructive and damaging Tory legislation.  “She should have no place in a Labour Party committed to progressive values and working-class people. Sadly, Keir Starmer is taking Labour away from its core values, aping a failed Tory Party instead of offering a real alternative to it. More than ever, Britain wants change-but is being offered a two-party consensus instead.”                      08 May 2024-12:20PM GMT                                         Labour has not offered me a peerage, says Elphicke                    Natalie Elphicke denied that she had been offered a peerage by Labour. Ms Elphicke is standing down as an MP at the general election.  Asked if she had been promised a seat in the House of Lords, Ms Elphicke told Sky News: “No. What I’ve said that I will do and what I’ve been asked to do is to contribute in the area of housing, which has been a longstanding area of experience for me. “It’s absolutely vital that we build the homes the country needs because under Rishi Sunak we’ve seen housebuilding simply collapse in this last year.”                      08 May 2024-12:15PM GMT                                         Elphicke: Sunak ‘abandoned’ centre ground                    Natalie Elphicke accused Rishi Sunak of abandoning the centre ground of British politics as she spoke to broadcasters for the first time following her defection to Labour. She told Sky News: “In 2019 the Conservatives stood on a manifesto that was very much centre ground but under Rishi Sunak they have abandoned the centre ground and broken many election promises.  “Meanwhile, under Keir Starmer Labour have changed and I think that change is going to bring a much better future for our country and that is why I was so keen to join the Labour Party and play my part in bringing that important future forward.”                       08 May 2024-12:12PM GMT                                         Minister claims Elphicke was one of the most right-wing Tory MPs                    Steve Baker, a Northern Ireland minister, suggested Natalie Elphicke was one of the most right-wing Tory MPs as he appeared to question her defection to Labour.

Asked when Rishi Sunak found out about the defection, the Prime Minister’s press secretary told reporters: “I wouldn’t get into conversations between the PM and his colleagues. “What I can say though is I’m sure it will come as a surprise to her constituents, given that they are on the front line of the illegal immigration issue and she has spent years tweeting about how Labour have absolutely no plan to deal with this.” Ms Elphicke’s feed on Twitter is “somewhat of a treasure trove on Labour’s weakness on this area,” she said.                      08 May 2024-12:07PM GMT                                         Pictured: Starmer holds talks with Elphicke following defection from Tories                                         08 May 2024-12:02PM GMT                                         Nadine Dorries responds to defection of Natalie Elphicke                    Nadine Dorries, the former Tory MP and ex-Cabinet minister, suggested the defection of Natalie Elphicke to Labour showed Boris Johnson’s version of the Conservative Party “no longer exists”.

The short answer is not much.  There is no parliamentary rule stating that an MP cannot change party and there is also no rule forcing them to hold a by-election when they do so.  The only significant change which comes with defecting is where the MP sits in the House of Commons: A very visible representation of their change in loyalties.                       08 May 2024-11:42AM GMT                                         Natalie Elphicke to stand down as MP at next election                    Natalie Elphicke will stand down at the next general election, Labour said.

The Labour leader said voters had realised there was “nothing behind the boasts, the gimmicks, the smug smile, he is a dodgy salesman desperate to sell them a dud”.  Turning to small boat crossings, Sir Keir labelled the Rwanda plan a “gimmick, not a deterrent”.  Mr Sunak sought to change the subject to comments made by Sadiq Khan  about Hamas and Israel.  On small boats, Mr Sunak said that since becoming Prime Minister crossings were “down by a third” and claimed that Sir Keir was “happy with open borders”.                       08 May 2024-11:12AM GMT                                         PM labels Labour leader a ‘virtue signalling lawyer from north London’                    Sir Keir Starmer told Rishi Sunak that the “public keep telling him it is not good enough, instead of listening he keeps telling them that everything is fine, if only they would realise his greatness”.  Mr Sunak hit back and labelled the Labour leader a “virtue signalling lawyer from north London”.                       08 May 2024-11:09AM GMT                                         Starmer goads Sunak over Tory defections to Labour                    Sir Keir Starmer is now on his feet at Prime Minister’s Questions.  The Labour leader welcomed Natalie Elphicke to the Labour benches, as well as Chris Webb, the Labour Party’s new Blackpool South MP. Both of the new Labour MPs were sat on the benches behind Sir Keir.  Sir Keir asked Rishi Sunak, given recent Tory defections to Labour: “What is the point of this failed government staggering on”.  He also asked: “How many more times do the public and his own MPs need to reject him before he takes the hint?”  Mr Sunak replied: “This time last year I reminded him of some advice actually from his own mentor Tony Blair who had said at the time he can be as cocky as he likes about local elections but come a general election it is policy that counts. “One year on from that advice, what has he managed? £28bn of tax rises, 70 new business regulations, 30 U-turns and a deputy leader under a police investigation.”                       08 May 2024-11:03AM GMT                                         Natalie Elphicke statement in full on defection to Labour                    Natalie Elphicke, now the Labour MP for Dover, said in a statement:  Today I announce that I have decided to join the Labour Party and that I will sit in Parliament as a Labour MP. When I was elected in 2019, the Conservative Party occupied the centre ground of British politics. The party was about building the future and making the most of the opportunities that lay ahead for our country.  Since then, many things have changed. The elected Prime Minister was ousted in a coup led by the unelected Rishi Sunak. Under Rishi Sunak, the Conservatives have become a byword for incompetence and division. The centre ground has been abandoned and key pledges of the 2019 manifesto have been ditched. Meanwhile the Labour Party has changed out of all recognition. Since 2019, it has moved on from Jeremy Corbyn and now, under Keir Starmer, occupies the centre ground of British politics. It has accepted Brexit and its economic policies and defence policies are responsible and can be trusted. Most significantly for me, the modern Labour Party looks to the future – to building a Britain of hope, optimism, opportunity and fairness. A Britain everyone can be part of. I have carefully considered this decision. The change has been dramatic and cannot be ignored. For me key deciding factors have been housing and the safety and security of our borders. From small boats to biosecurity, Rishi Sunak’s government is failing to keep our borders safe and secure. Lives are being lost in the English Channel while small boat arrivals are once again at record levels. It’s clear they have failed to keep our borders secure and cannot be trusted. On housing, Rishi Sunak’s Government is now failing to build the homes we need. Last year saw the largest fall of new housing starts in England in a single year since the credit crunch. The manifesto committed to 300,000 homes next year – but only around half that number are now set to be built. Renters and leaseholders have been betrayed as manifesto pledges to end no fault evictions and abolish ground rents have not been delivered as promised. The last couple of years have also seen a huge rise in homelessness, in temporary accommodation and rough sleeping-with record numbers of children now in temporary accommodation, without a secure roof over their head. Meanwhile Labour plan to build the homes we need, help young people onto the housing ladder and care about the vulnerable and homeless. That’s why I’m honoured to have been asked to work with Keir and the team to help deliver the homes we need.  We need to move on from the broken promises of Rishi Sunak’s tired and chaotic Government. Britain needs a Government that will build a future of hope, optimism, opportunity and fairness. A Britain everyone can be part of, that will make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead. That’s why it’s time for change. Time for a Labour Government led by Keir Starmer. The General Election cannot come soon enough.                      08 May 2024-11:01AM GMT                                         Tory MP Natalie Elphicke defects to Labour                    Tory MP Natalie Elphicke has defected to Labour, hitting out at the “broken promises of Rishi Sunak’s tired and chaotic government”.                      08 May 2024-10:41AM GMT                                         Monty Panesar no longer standing at election for Workers Party                    Monty Panesar, the former England cricketer, has withdrawn as a candidate for George Galloway’s Workers Party of Great Britain at the next election, writes Dominic Penna, The Telegraph’s political correspondent. The 42-year-old was set to run against Virendra Sharma, the Labour incumbent in Ealing Southall, west London. But in a series of posts on Twitter, Mr Panesar said: “I’m a proud Brit who has had the honour to represent my country at the highest level of cricket. “I now want to do my bit to help others but I recognise I am at the beginning of my journey and still learning about how politics can help people. “So today I am withdrawing as a general election candidate for the Workers’ Party. I realise I need more time to listen, learn and find my political home, one that aligns with my personal and political values.” I wish The Workers Party all the best but look forward to taking some time to mature and find my political feet so I am well prepared to deliver my very best when I next run up to the political wicket.

In a report co-authored by former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) urged the Government to introduce caps on legal immigration to stop a drain on British infrastructure and public services that is not offset by economic growth. In particular, high levels of immigration are “significantly exacerbating the housing crisis”, it said.

It is a different tale for Rishi Sunak.  Mr Sunak appears to be secure in his position as the captain of the Tory ship despite suffering heavy losses last week. There is currently no appetite for mutiny among Conservative MPs. But Mr Sunak will be desperate to improve morale and show that the general election result is not a foregone conclusion.  A strong showing at PMQs would be a good place to start for the PM.                      08 May 2024-10:00AM GMT                                         Jenrick ‘not opposed’ to Farage rejoining Tories                    Robert Jenrick said he would not oppose Nigel Farage rejoining the Conservative Party.  Mr Farage, the honorary president of Reform UK, left the Tories in the early 1990s and there has been speculation about whether he could return.  Asked if it was time to welcome Mr Farage back, Mr Jenrick, the former immigration minister, told LBC: “Well, I would not oppose Nigel Farage coming back into the party, but that’s not our priority. “He’s associated with a different political party today. What we should be doing is tackling the issues that the public care about and which are leading some former Conservative voters to look elsewhere, and as I say, legal migration seems to be absolutely top of the list and I believe that can be improved in the months ahead.”                      08 May 2024-09:44AM GMT                                         Jeremy Hunt hits back at Labour over living standards attack line                    Jeremy Hunt has hit back at a Labour attack line on living standards. Rachel Reeves referenced forecasts in her speech in the City of London yesterday that suggested this will be the first Parliament on record where living standards will be lower at the end than they were at the start.  The forecast, put together by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, has been frequently referenced by Labour in an attempt to damage the Tories.  But Mr Hunt, the Chancellor, tweeted this morning: “Just to note, this is also the first Parliament on record where we shut down the economy to stave off a pandemic, then faced a global energy price shock almost immediately after.  “Think that might have had something to do with it.”                       08 May 2024-09:24AM GMT                                         John Swinney sworn in as First Minister of Scotland                    John Swinney has officially been sworn in as Scottish First Minister at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, writes Simon Johnson, The Telegraph’s Scottish political editor.  He is expected to arrive at his Bute House official residence at around 11am. A series of SNP MSPs will then arrive as he appoints his new Cabinet and sacks others. All eyes will be on what role he decides to give Kate Forbes in return for her agreeing not to contest the SNP leadership. There is a lot of speculation she will get her old job back of Finance Secretary or be made Economy Secretary. It will also be interesting to see who Mr Swinney makes his Deputy First Minister.                       08 May 2024-09:13AM GMT                                         Three in 10 Tory voters believe Sunak should resign, YouGov poll finds                    Three in 10 Conservative voters believe Rishi Sunak should quit as Tory leader before the next general election, according to a new YouGov poll.  A survey of more than 4,000 people conducted yesterday found that 31 per cent of 2019 Tory supporters believed Mr Sunak should resign.  A small majority-54 per cent-said the Prime Minister should remain in his role and lead the Conservative Party into the next election.  Among all voters, there was a relatively even split on what people believed he should do.  Some 40 per cent said he should remain in his role and 39 per cent said he should resign.

A new YouGov poll, conducted yesterday, found just 7 per cent of people want the election to take place in the winter of this year and 9 per cent picked January 2025-the absolute latest it can happen.  But four in 10 voters (41 per cent) said they wanted the election this summer and 23 per cent said it should be held in the autumn.  Rishi Sunak has said his “working assumption” is that the election will be held in the second half of 2024.

The former immigration minister said Mr Sunak and the Government needed to be honest with the public “about the mistakes of the past” and also focus on delivering as much “positive change” as possible in the time remaining before the general election.  Mr Jenrick, who has produced a paper on new measures to curb net migration, said: “What I’ve tried to set out are a series of policies that could be implemented before the general election, such as what I’m saying today on legal migration, which would convince some of those Conservative voters – who are essentially on strike – to come back and support the party at the general election. “And also to persuade some of those voters who are considering voting Reform that we do care about the issues that they do, which are principally immigration, but also on crime, on extremism and on lower taxes. “And if we can do that, I think we can persuade more of those former Conservative voters to come back and to support us. “But that will require honesty, it requires levelling with the public about the mistakes of the past and using every last minute we have in office before the general election to actually deliver positive change for the public.”                      08 May 2024-08:22AM GMT                                         Pictured: Starmer leaves his London home this morning ahead of PMQs at noon                                         08 May 2024-08:02AM GMT                                         Ashworth rails against SNP ‘chaos’ after Swinney becomes First Minister                    A Labour frontbencher would not be drawn on whether John Swinney could be a tougher opponent as SNP leader than Humza Yousaf.  Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general, was asked during an interview on Sky News if he feared Mr Swinney could galvanise support for the SNP ahead of the general election.  Mr Ashworth said: “In the same way we have had chaos under 14 years of the Conservatives in Westminster, it has been chaos in Scotland.”  He added: “I think we will at the next general election be making the case that it is time to turn the page on 14 years of Conservative failure at Westminster at a UK level and it is years of failure under the SNP in Scotland as well and it is time for change there.”                      08 May 2024-07:47AM GMT                                         Jenrick: ‘Serious errors’ made after Brexit on immigration policy                    Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, said post-Brexit governments had made “serious errors” on immigration policy.  He said a failure to deliver better border control after leaving the European Union amounted to a “betrayal of Brexit”.  He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain programme: “I do think that the government has made some serious errors after we left the European Union because for the first time in my lifetime we actually took back control of the levers of migration, we ended free movement and that meant that politicians had much more control than they had ever had in the past but they did make some serious mistakes.  “And that to me was a betrayal of Brexit. What we have got to do now is fix it and we still have time within this Parliament to make the changes that I am proposing which would ensure that we get back down to the ‘tens of thousands’.”  Mr Jenrick has advocated making sweeping changes  to the immigration system. Those changes include scrapping the graduate visa route and placing an immediate cap on health and care visas at roughly 30,000. 'That record level of legal migration happened on your watch.

The Energy Security and Net Zero Secretary acknowledged the local election results were “disappointing” but said “I do think we have a positive message that we need to communicate to people”. Asked if the party needed to shift to the right, she told Times Radio: “I think what we need to do is to go where the country is.” She added: “They want us to be tough on immigration. They want us to be cognisant of the fact that they’ve had a difficult time when it comes to public finances, which is why we’re putting forward £900 of tax cuts. “They want us to make sure that we’re protecting their security, which we are when it comes to defence, when it comes to energy as well.”                      08 May 2024-07:23AM GMT                                         Pictured: Jeremy Hunt goes for a run in Westminster with his dog Poppy                                         08 May 2024-07:13AM GMT                                         Labour won’t raise state pension age, says Reeves                    Rachel Reeves suggested a Labour government would not increase the state pension age any further than already planned. The state pension age rose to 66  between 2018 and 2020 and is due to rise to 67 between 2026 and 2028. Asked if there was any prospect of Labour raising the state pension age any further, the shadow chancellor told LBC: “What you’d need to see for any further increases in the state pension age is life expectancy increasing and sadly it’s going backwards at the moment but also healthy life expectancy and sadly that is also going back at the moment.  “So I don’t think there’s any justification for further increases in the state pension age.”                      08 May 2024-06:57AM GMT                                         Tories must show they are ‘on the side of voters’, says Rees-Mogg                    The Tories must “show ourselves to be on the side of voters” to win back support ahead of the general election, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg has argued.  The former business secretary called for more effective action on tackling immigration, for the “war on the motorist” to be stopped and for the Net Zero drive to be delayed.  Sir Jacob told GB News: “We must support our nation by being proud of its noble history and not giving in to those who hate Britain and all that we have achieved. We must not kowtow to the woke agenda or adjust our language to satisfy fanatics. “In short, we must be conservative and show ourselves to be on the side of voters.

The little inconveniences of life must be removed and officialdom must work for the citizen, not the other way round.”                      08 May 2024-06:47AM GMT                                         Rees-Mogg: Elections ‘thumping’ will be repeated unless Tories become more conservative                    Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg warned the “thumping” suffered by the Tories at the local elections will be repeated at the general election unless they become more conservative.  The former business secretary said there needed to be a change in approach from Rishi Sunak on key issues because the party currently has “no vision”.  He told GB News: “Last week’s election results were a thumping defeat for the Tories, and a warning of what is likely to follow at a general election. “Although Labour under Keir Starmer is not as popular as New Labour under Blair, the electorate is wary of a Conservative Party that has no vision. “All we seem to offer is an arguably competent management of the status quo, which the Labour Party seeks to mimic. Yet the status quo is not good enough. Public services are not of a satisfactory standard at the moment.” Load-Date: May 9, 2024  End of Document
