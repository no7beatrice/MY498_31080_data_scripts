   Mary, Brexit and the "trap" of the will of the people CE Noticias Financieras English January 13, 2024 Saturday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC.

They stopped her at Luton airport last December 26 and warned her that she was "wasting her time" if she considered that the permit she showed them to prove she worked there was valid.          The case of the 34-year-old is an example of the limbo in which many EU citizens find themselves since the application of the rules imposed by the Brexit. Among them are more than 5,700 Spaniards who risk expulsion from the UK while waiting for their status to be resolved. It is proof of how democracy sometimes makes things difficult, in the apt expression of Ben Ansell, professor at Oxford University and author of 'Why Politics Fails' (Peninsula).          This professor of Comparative Institutional Democracy analyzes in his essay the complexity of a vote such as the referendum whose result implied the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Those in favor of leaving prevailed with 52% of the votes against 48% of those opposed. Democracy was applied and at the same time the difficulty of putting it into practice was demonstrated, since the complexity of the process went and goes beyond a 'yes' or 'no' on a ballot paper, and if not, just ask Theresa May.          Politics, like life, often cannot be summed up in a simplistic choice. But that is what happened in Brexit and what leads Ansell to theorize about the crux of what he calls the 'trap' of democracy: the 'will of the people' does not exist. For there are collective decisions whose implementation can be chaotic and often the result of misrepresentations. "If we want democracy to work - and to prevent politics from failing - we are forced to balance on the razor's edge between chaos and polarization," stresses the American professor.          Continuing with the same thesis, one of the conclusions would be that for democracy to work it must be stabilized and that implies avoiding a scorched earth strategy. When politics is associated with permanent conflict, blockade and a perpetual tug-of-war, there is a risk of stagnation. "If we want democracy to work - and to prevent politics from failing - we are forced to make trade-offs on the razor's edge between chaos and polarization                                           Ben Ansell - Professor of Comparative Institutional Democracy                   Barack Obama was among the first to lament the lack of empathy in politics and argued that this was a key issue in trying to reduce polarization. It is clear that neither in the United States nor here has progress been made in the sense of listening more to the adversary and seeking consensus wherever possible. One of the reasons is that there are parties that already find it convenient to feed extremism. Exacerbating the so-called affective polarization also translates into electoral results.          "It is no longer a matter of uniting people around the lowest common denominator, but, on the contrary, inflaming the passions of as many small groups as possible and then adding them together, even without their knowledge. To conquer a majority, they will not converge towards the center, but will join the extremes", diagnoses Giuliano da Empoli in 'The Engineers of Chaos' (Oberon). This professor of political communication analyzes how behind Brexit, Trump or the Italian extreme right there are experts in political communication and specialists in big data to tense social networks and thus feed discourses that pervert the functioning of democracy.          They were Steve Bannon in the United States or Dominic Cummings in the United Kingdom but there are many more even if they are unknown to most. They encourage and feed on fear in the same way that they benefit from the tension and spread it to the more centered formations as it has been proved in Spain or illustrated just a few days ago by the newspaper 'Libération' in reference to the French right wing.          The consequences of the misrepresentation of concepts such as equality and solidarity, going beyond partisan boundaries to place themselves more and more in "ideological trenches", as described by political scientist Lluís Orriols, undermine confidence in the institutions, fundamental pillars for democracy to function. "The main victims of this context may be the transversal pacts, those agreements on policies and reforms solid enough to last over time and transcend the government of the day," Orriols points out in an article that analyzes how polarization of a more emotional nature has evolved in recent years.          That polarization is largely fueled by misinformation, identified as the most serious short-term threat in the Global Risks 2024 report released Wednesday, which will be part of the discussions at the upcoming Davos summit. "Both foreign and domestic actors will exploit misinformation and disinformation to increase social and political divisions," stresses a study to be discussed next week in the Swiss city.          If disinformation is identified as one of the main risks to stability at that meeting, which will once again be attended by the world's main political and economic leaders, it is to be hoped that there will be some kind of commitment to activate measures to combat it. For the Brexit they are already late, but considering that this year elections will be held in 76 countries and that more than half of the world's population is called to vote, anything that helps to stabilize democracies, from the United States to South Africa through the European Union, will be little.
