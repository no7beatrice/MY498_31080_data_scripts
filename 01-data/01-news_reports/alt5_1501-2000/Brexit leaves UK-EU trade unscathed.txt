   Brexit leaves UK-EU trade unscathed CE Noticias Financieras English November 6, 2023 Monday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

"The UK's trade patterns with the EU do not show a Brexit effect, either since the referendum or at the end of the transition period," said the organization. UK exports of goods increased by 13.5% to EU countries and 14.3% to non-EU countries between 2019 and 2022, before and after Brexit, indicating no impact of the exit on trade in goods. During the same period, UK exports of services increased by 14.8% to EU countries and 22.1% to non-EU countries.

Three years after Brexit, assessment is negative | Monitor Mercantil Real-world trade data paints a totally different picture to that of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which claimed that Brexit barriers would result in a 15% drop in trade volumes, contributing to a 4% GDP in the long term. "Although the data is still emerging and the long-term effects are still unpredictable, overall there was no real disparity between the UK's trade with EU and non-EU countries," said the report's author, economist Catherine McBride. She attributed the resilience of UK trade with the EU to the tariff-free and quota-free Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), which was signed in 2020. "The impact of Brexit on trade will ultimately be determined by how the UK uses the new regulatory and trade policy powers," said the economist. Load-Date: November 7, 2023  End of Document
