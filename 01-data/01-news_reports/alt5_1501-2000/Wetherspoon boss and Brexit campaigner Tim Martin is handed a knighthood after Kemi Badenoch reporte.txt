   Wetherspoon boss and Brexit campaigner Tim Martin is handed a knighthood after Kemi Badenoch reportedly pushed for pub landlord to be honoured MailOnline December 27, 2023 Wednesday 9:50 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 558 words Byline: Jason Groves Martin Beckford Body   Founder of JD Wetherspoon in New Year Honours for services to business Pub boss and Brexit campaigner Tim Martin is to be knighted in the New Year Honours. The outspoken JD Wetherspoon founder has been nominated for the honour for services to business after building one of Britain's biggest pub chains from scratch. But the nomination also reflects his status as one of the leading pro-Brexit business voices in the 2016 referendum on whether to leave the EU. Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch is said to have pushed his candidacy behind the scenes, arguing that it is wrong for successful entrepreneurs to be overlooked by the Establishment because they supported Brexit. And leading Brexiteers welcomed the nomination last night.                      Nigel Farage, who hailed Mr Martin as a 'Brexit legend', described him as a 'larger than life character, an entrepreneur to his fingertips and great company'. Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg said: 'I am delighted to hear this as Tim not only was brave enough to take up the political cudgels in support of the majority of the British people but he also brings daily cheer to people's lives through the good value provided by his pubs. A true British paladin.' Former Cabinet minister David Jones said: 'Tim Martin played a big part in the Brexit campaign. He was in tune with the national sentiment and understood the desire of the British people to recover their independence. The honour is well deserved and long overdue.' Mr Martin, the son of a Guinness executive, opened his first pub in Muswell Hill, north London, in 1979. He initially named it Martin's Free House, but renamed it Wetherspoons the following year after a teacher who had told him he would never amount to anything. JD Wetherspoon was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1992 and now operates more than 800 pubs, which have carved out a reputation for good value food and drink. Last year it recorded a turnover of £1.9billion and returned to profit for the first time since the Covid pandemic. Mr Martin is also well known for his forthright views on politics and business. He has lambasted politicians for treating pubs as a 'milk cow' and taxing them more heavily than supermarkets. During the pandemic he clashed with ministers over restrictions on hospitality, arguing that people were more likely to catch the virus at home than in a well-run pub. But the 68-year-old is best known in the political world for his opposition to EU red tape and his trenchant support for Brexit. During the 2016 referendum he donated £200,000 to the victorious Vote Leave campaign and became one of the most prominent business supporters in a campaign in which the Remain side tried to claim that the business world was united in opposition to leaving the EU. During Theresa May's negotiations with Brussels he supported a no-deal Brexit, arguing it would bring down prices for consumers. He later backed Boris Johnson to become Prime Minister. In 2018, he announced that his pubs would ditch French champagne and German wheat beers in favour of alternatives from Britain and Australia. The Cabinet Office declined to comment ahead of the publication of the New Year Honours this weekend. A spokesman said: 'It would be in inappropriate to comment on speculation regarding potential honours recipients. The honours list will be published shortly in the usual way.'
