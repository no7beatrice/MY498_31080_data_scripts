   Voices: Most Brits think Brexit has failed, but only a tiny minority want to do anything about it The Independent (United Kingdom) June 12, 2023 Monday 10:55 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: INDEPENDENT PREMIUM; Version:1 Length: 940 words Byline: Sunder Katwala Highlight: The challenges of grappling with what happens after Brexit will not go away for many years, even decades, to come. But there are good reasons why many people will be reluctant to get back into the old referendum trenches once more, says Sunder Katwala Body   Brexit  divided Britain  as never before. Not only did it split the country over the question on the referendum paper, it also created two new identity tribes, Remainers and Leavers. It was a story of bad winners and bad losers, which has left Britain much more divided three years after the vote than during the 2016 referendum campaign itself. There has been a significant shift of opinion towards regret , but the much more dominant mood is of exhaustion. Most Leave  voters have not changed their mind, though a fifth have. Those too young to vote in 2016 think it was a bad idea by a four to one margin. But the overwhelming emotion is that of not wanting to hear more about Brexit from anyone.  In the latest Ipsos issues index , one per cent of people think Brexit is the most important issue facing Britain, and seven per cent rank it as a priority issue. Though unconvinced that they have seen any benefits from Brexit, only four per cent of the under-35s consider it a priority compared to nine per cent of the over-55s. Some say that everything people care about more – the economy, inflation, the NHS, climate change and immigration – is connected to Brexit, but that is not the common feeling among the country right now. So what should Keir Starmer  do about Brexit? “Making Brexit work” is now one of the priorities of the government that he hopes to lead.  This would not have been a role that the Labour  leader would have imagined trying to play when he first entered parliament in 2015, anticipating neither the Corbynite insurgency in his own party, nor that the effort to keep Britain inside the European Union would fail to persuade a majority, changing the political context. Nor indeed in the years after the referendum, when he was among those trying to keep the prospects for another referendum before Brexit on the table. If Labour does come to power it will be the first time that the referendum “losers” will get to grapple with Brexit in power. Starmer’s instinct is now to bridge the divide, since the electoral geography of the party’s 2019 defeat means that Starmer gives a strong priority to the minority of Leave voters who now intend to vote Labour, though he will have been elected primarily by people who find the idea quixotic, for whom “making Brexit work” sounds primarily like an exercise in damage limitation. Starmer’s emphasis on accepting Brexit is combined with the knowledge that making Brexit work must involve more practical cooperation with our friends in Europe.  But every move to try will see cries of betrayal from political opponents, and in the Daily Express and the DailyMail, though there is enormous public will for a gradualist exploration of closer cooperation on a case-by-case basis.  How far this post-Brexit gradualism mitigates the disappointment of would-be rejoiners remains to be seen. The appetite and capacity on the EU side for bespoke negotiations with Britain may be limited, though the success of Sunak’s Windsor Declaration shows some willingness to reciprocate a constructive agenda, particularly given wider shared interests, from security in a volatile continent to the challenges of climate change.  Let us be clear: there will be pressure to put the single market back on the agenda by the second half of the decade. Both Sunak and Starmer want to rule that out, a position that they will surely maintain during the next general election.  But after that? It is easy to see how the next Labour leadership contest – maybe early in the 2030s – could be won by a candidate campaigning to put the single market back on the agenda, a position that is attractive to most of the party’s members and voters, as long as the party thinks it could handle the issue of freedom of movement better than it did last time, when a loss of confidence in how the scale and pace of immigration was handled after EU enlargement after 2004 both under New Labour and David Cameron were undoubtedly crucial to pressure for the Brexit referendum, and a significant factor in the 52% Leave vote. It would seem logical for the Liberal Democrats  to seek to outflank Labour on joining the single market, where the party's “Blue Wall” target voters, often Conservative ex-Remainers, might be somewhat softer than Labour's Red Wall target vote, though the party has been somewhat backwards in coming forwards to make it an issue after its anti-Brexit position did not take off in 2017 or 2019. Rejoiners will need a longer march still. In principle, opinion polls now show a majority for Rejoin, but that support may well be rather shallow. It may be that UK voters would consider going back in on the old terms, but they will never be available again. EU governments would be unconvinced by a polarising narrow argument to rejoin that another government may overturn again. It took the Eurosceptic movements four decades, largely in the wilderness, to overturn the 1975 decision of the public to stay in. It is possible that Rejoin campaigners could persuade a major party – most likely Labour -to make a referendum pledge to revisit the question of membership in, say, 2033, 2037, 2041 or later. What the architecture of the European Union and the wider continent will be in future decades may make the question a different one by then. The challenges of grappling with what happens after Brexit will not go away for many years, even decades, to come. But there are good reasons why many people will be reluctant to get back into the old referendum trenches once more.
