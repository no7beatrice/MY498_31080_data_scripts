   ADHD sufferers 'paying the price of Brexit' after medication shortages dailyrecord.co.uk December 5, 2023 Tuesday 4:30 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 629 words Byline: By, Andrew Quinn Highlight: The shortages have left 70 per cent of patients surveyed by charity ADHD UK rationing their supplies. Body   The SNP has claimed ADHD sufferers are "paying the price" of Brexit as a medication shortage is expected to last until spring.                      The party's Westminster health spokesperson Amy Callaghan said thousands of people with ADHD are "now having to ration or go without essential medication to manage their conditions". She added that they are already suffering "devastating consequences". It comes as the main ADHD medication provider Takeda has said that shortages of the medication are now expected to last until April next year. The shortages have left 70 per cent of patients surveyed by charity ADHD UK rationing their supplies. In September, the UK Department of Health and Social Care issued a Patient Safety Alert which predicted supply issues to be resolved before the new year. The SNP has said it is vital that the UK Government acts now to reverse the damage caused to supply chains by Brexit. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a condition that can affect people's behaviour and ability to concentrate. ADHD research has revealed that just eight per cent of ADHD patients have been unaffected by supply issues caused by the medication shortage. They called the situation a "crisis". Some 62 per cent of their respondents who take medication for their condition have had suicidal thoughts or an increase in suicidal thoughts since the start of the crisis. Callaghan said the blame for the shortage lay with "this Tory government's botched Brexit". She said: "People in Scotland living with ADHD are paying the price for this Tory government's botched Brexit, with thousands now having to ration or go without essential medication to manage their conditions, already with devastating consequences. "From workforce shortages to supply chain delays, Brexit has brought not a single benefit to our NHS - and as the research from ADHD UK shows, the problems are piling up. People with ADHD deserve better than this. "Despite voting overwhelmingly to remain, Scotland is not immune to the consequences of this reckless Tory government's broken, backwards Brexit obsession -but we don't have to put up with it. "With independence, we can make sure that patients in Scotland never have to worry about filling their prescription, by re-joining the EU as an independent nation state." A study earlier this year found that ADHD cases amongst adults and boys in the UK have soared since the year 2000. It's expected that the number of cases is likely to climb even higher after a study by University College London found that ADHD medication prescriptions have increased over the same time period. Most cases of ADHD are diagnosed in boys aged ten to 16. More than 60 per cent of Scots voted against Brexit in 2016. But 52 per cent of people across the UK voted for it. The UK then left the European Union in January 2020. A UK Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: "Disruptions to the supply of medicines used for the management of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD have been primarily driven by issues which have resulted in capacity constraints at key manufacturing sites. "We understand how frustrating and distressing medicine shortages can be and we want to assure patients that we are working intensively with suppliers to ensure that action is taken to improve the supply position. Some issues have now been resolved. "We have issued communications to the NHS to advise healthcare professionals on management of patients whilst there continue to be disruptions to supplies. Patients are advised to speak to their clinician regarding any concerns they have and to discuss the suitability of treatment with alternative medicines."
