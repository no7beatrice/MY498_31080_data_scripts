   Brexit is to blame for all ills for many Britons CE Noticias Financieras English June 11, 2023 Sunday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

Even the business community is going along with it. In May the multinational automakers Ford, Jaguar and Vauxhall warned the government that the current agreement with the European Union (EU) threatened the survival of an industry that employs some 800,000 people. This June 20, some 1,000 companies and representatives of the countryside and fishing industry are meeting at a conference whose central theme is the search for a different type of agreement with the EU.        The discontent has spread to the architects of Brexit. Interviewed by the BBC, Nigel Farage, the anti-European champion who forced the Conservatives' shift to the right and the 2016 referendum, did not mince words: "Brexit has failed".  The other Brexit         Of course, Farage and the anti-European hard core do not abjure the concept of Brexit but its implementation, the fact that the separation from the European bloc has not been completed, has not been sufficient, has not reached its goal. It is equally astonishing that Farage has dared to say it out loud: "Brexit has failed".          There is no shortage of culprits: the BBC, the politicians, the mandarins of the public administration. "It is true that the Brexit did not benefit the UK, but that was due to useless politicians who mismanaged the whole project very badly," was Farage's argument.            Farage's justification is difficult to sustain because the Tories have been in government for 13 years and since the referendum were hegemonized by increasingly radically anti-European versions, orchestrated by the most extreme group of all, the "European Research Group".          The main whipping boy of this group today inhabits 10 Downing Street, voted for Brexit and is stealthily seeking a rapprochement with Europe. In the dwindling ranks of the anti-Europeans, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is the Brutus who plunged the dagger in the back of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss and the Judas who seeks to strike a new deal with the EU that would retain most of the regulations and laws that bind the UK to the continent.  The sick man of Europe           Meanwhile the house burns. Inflation is double that of the U.S. and above the countries of the reviled EU, the economy is not coming out of stagnation and next year will be in recession. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has put Britain's growth expectation below Russia's, a comparison that, in the midst of the war and sanctions regime against Vladimir Putin's government, no one seems too interested in highlighting or analyzing.           The humiliation, however, is palpable. Financial Times economics editor Chris Giles sums it up with a phrase that has haunted the countries of Europe since the 19th century to decide who is the worst in class: "is the UK once again the "sick man" of Europe?        The signs of the disease are all over the economic and social body. Seven years on from the Brexit that was to return the UK to imperial glory, public services are disintegrating and the country is mired in strikes and cost of living protests. Last year, three million emergency food parcels were delivered to so-called "food Banks" that cater to people in precarious situations.         The novelty of the post-pandemic is that it is not only the unemployed or homeless who go to these food banks. The numbers have skyrocketed because they have become the refuge of nurses and teachers who cannot make ends meet, of public or private sector employees who have seen a sharp drop in their salary in relation to the cost of living. Brexit: food, fishing and health         Food price inflation is the most notorious and pressing element of the "cost of living crisis". It is clear to no one that this is a global problem, but almost no one denies that Brexit has made the situation worse than ever.         The United Kingdom imports half of what it consumes in food and 50% of that percentage comes from the European Union. In addition to the increase in costs due to greater trade and tariff or para-tariff bureaucracy, there is also the diversion of exports that used to go to the United Kingdom and now go to less complicated countries. In the last inflation measurement, prices on average had increased around 8% (a decrease with respect to the previous month), but food prices had continued to rise and exceeded 18%.         An iconic sector of the disillusionment with Brexit is the fishing sector. Minimal in economic terms (0.03% of GDP), it became one of the "causas belli" of the 2016 referendum based on the idea that the UK would regain control over its own economy ("take back control" was the slogan: "our sea, our land") and grow exponentially. This debate, full of emotions and empty of arguments, was missing a key. Most British fisheries are exported to the EU: by leaving the bloc, the UK becomes a third country that has to agree fishing quotas with the bloc and adhere to trade regulations.            The promise during the referendum was that, freed from the chains of the EU, fishing would jump to almost 300,000 tons, some 300 million dollars more for an industry that was experiencing a decades-long decline. In an arduous negotiation with the EU, the government got a much smaller increase in fishing quotas - 107,000 tons - and lost much of what it gained in talks with Norway, another extra-European fishing power. "It was all a lie. That we were going to get our coasts back and all that," says Jane Sandel of UK Fisheries.          Far more serious and palpable is the deterioration of the National Health Service (NHS). In 2016 the most visible figure in the pro-Brexit campaign, one Boris Johnson, said that the UK could reinvest £350 million a week in the NHS thanks to the savings it would make by breaking away from the bloc. Pure smoke. Pandemic through the NHS has a waiting list of seven million patients, 10% of its posts vacant and has yet to fully resolve a more than year-long labor dispute over back pay for its staff at all levels, from healthcare to clerical.  And now what?      The list of unfulfilled Brexit promises includes everything from the conflict in Northern Ireland to the lack of workers in key sectors due to the emigration of Europeans, from the decrease in the immigration flow (which paradoxically increased) to the proliferation of trade agreements and economic bonanza.       Despite all this, the main British parties do not even want to hear about another referendum. The leader of the opposition, the cautious and insipid Labour Sir Keir Starmer, who voted to remain in the EU, says his goal is not to return to the EU but to achieve a Brexit that works for the country. It is the policy being pursued quietly by Sunak who has improved the relationship with the European bloc and secured a deal on Northern Ireland.        Amid the hangover it is clear that the motley coalition that under the banner of Brexit gave Boris Johnson an 80-seat parliamentary majority in 2019 has disintegrated and has no chance of resurrection. In that election the "golden blond" managed to bring together under the umbrella of an insular anti-European nationalism conservatives, traditionalists, rural sectors and even the deindustrialized north that had voted all their lives for Labour and who bought Johnson's promises and anti-immigration and xenophobic message.         The defection is clear. In May's local elections the Conservatives lost in the impoverished north to Labour and in the affluent south to the Liberal Democrats. A recent poll found that 53% think the UK was wrong to leave the EU while 32% think it was the right thing to do (20% fewer than voted for it in 2016). But no one wants to open pandora's box. The most obvious danger is that a new referendum will galvanize these dispersed forces with one last breath of life, which is why pro-EUers are cautious.         Meanwhile the UK is heading for what one official body predicted during the referendum, in the 2019 election and after the Brexit was finalized on December 31, 2020: a steady economic decline. The latest estimate from the "UK Office for Budget Responsibility," which calculates growth projections for the government, is that Brexit will reduce output by 4% compared to the rest of the EU over the next 15 years. The UK is the only G7 country that did not regain the pre-pandemic level of growth, but no one is talking about changing course.           The general election is in the European autumn next year. The economic crisis is not reduced to the relationship with the EU, but as far as Brexit is concerned, it is difficult for there to be a turnaround because Sunak is shackled by his own party and, from the opposition, Labour does not want to open any flank that could rob them of what today looks like a sure electoral victory in 2024, after 14 years in opposition.
