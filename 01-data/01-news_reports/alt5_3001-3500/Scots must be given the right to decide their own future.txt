   Scots must be given the right to decide their own future dailyrecord.co.uk September 3, 2023 Sunday 3:17 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:2 Length: 909 words Byline: By, Stephen Flynn Highlight: In his first Daily Record column, SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn rips into the Tories, but says the election must be about more than kicking out the Conservatives Body   Skint, scunnered, and Scottish Blame the . Their pompous private school Etonian elite have snaked their way into many of the top jobs in politics yet they have no idea what it's like to work your hardest only to find that it's still not enough.  The bairns need new shoes, bread and beans are up in price again, electric is through the roof and that lot are telling you to 'hold your nerve'. Aye right. And don't forget, that's their message to you after thirteen years of rule from Westminster.  First, they gave us Cameron. He crippled folk on social security, starved the public sector of cash then caved to his own right-wing fantasists and served up Brexit. Then in danced May. Infamous for telling folk to 'go home', she quickly lost the trust of her own mob in the House of Commons over Brexit and was kicked out her temporary home. Her biggest failing though, that was probably what came next.  Johnson. Not a care in the world, well aside from the lining of the gold wallpaper. Millions left without a penny of support during covid, a Brexit deal that has left us all poorer, and so many lies that he couldn't even tell the truth about lying.  The greatest lies of all though, those belong to the voices that convinced Liz Truss she had what it takes to be Prime Minister. An economy smashed. The stupidity of Brexit on steroids. An arrogance only Westminster can create. And whilst she lives with publicly paid security for life, the public are left with financial insecurity.  After less than fifty days in office even the Tories couldn't stomach her anymore, so they placed a call to California and in flew Sunak to tell us all just to suck it up and ride it out. It'll be tough, the billionaire tells us, but it's a sacrifice he's willing to make.  But it's not really getting any easier, is it We know that in energy rich Scotland gas and electric bills will burn a hole right through pay slips this winter. We know that in Brexit Britain the cost of our supermarket staples continues to leave a sour taste in the mouth. And we know that no matter how high mortgages are hiked the 'might' of the UK Treasury won't be coming to rescue you. And what makes it all so much worse is the fact that Scotland didn't vote for one of those Prime Ministers. Not even close. We always do our bit, but on Westminster's watch it's not Scotland that matters and that's never going to change. And sooner or later, the Tories will win again in England and return to reign over us.  Surely, it's not too much to ask that the people of Scotland always get a government that we actually vote for.  So, the General Election can't just be about beating the Tories because Scotland will do that, and we'll do it better than ever. It must be about something much bigger; making sure that we never have to live under the rule of an unelected Tory Government ever again. And, the priorities of those standing to represent you in Westminster next year must be clear. They must put the cost-of-living crisis front and centre of their work, they must oppose not meekly accept the damage being caused by Brexit, and they must fight to give the people of Scotland the right to decide their own future. That's what real change, and real hope, looks like.  Skint, scunnered, and Scottish It's time to do something about it.                      TRUMP AND HOT AIR                     Donald Trump's mug shot. We've all seen it, and it will no doubt help shape the next US election. The good guys will rightly see it as the law catching up with a crook. The bad guys, and I mean the really bad guys, will use it to blow plenty of hot air between now and polling day.  Well, just off the coast from Donald Trump's golf course in Aberdeenshire we have plenty of wind too, and it's been getting put to good use. Much to his eternal delight. Of course, it's a collection of wind turbines. They've been churning for years now and are being joined by enormous developments right along Scotland's East Coast. A quiet revolution is blowing in, and it'll define our economic future. If we get it right then we create tens of thousands of secure jobs for the future, cheap energy for homes and business and an industrial base like that of yesteryear. The big question is, do we trust Westminster to get it right Decades of failed energy policy that's left us with insecure jobs, expensive energy and no industrial base would suggest not. I don't trust them to make Aberdeen great again.                      BACK OUR BOYS                                                                                      In Stephen we trust. Stephen Clarke that is. His decision to call-up Elliot Anderson, a little-known midfielder from Newcastle, for the double-header against England and Cyprus surprised many. But most surprises under Steve Clarke are good and I trust he's got this one right too.  With work in Westminster taking priority, my wee brother has snapped up my ticket for the England game at Hampden next week but I'm hoping to be back in amongst the Tartan Army in Spain next month. And who'd bet against us rejoicing about a famous win over the auld enemy in the Spanish sun                                             To sign up to the Daily Record Politics newsletter, click                                                                                                 here                                                                                            .
