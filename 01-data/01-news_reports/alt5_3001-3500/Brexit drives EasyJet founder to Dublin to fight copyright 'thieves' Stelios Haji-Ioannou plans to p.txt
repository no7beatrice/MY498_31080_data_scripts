   Brexit drives EasyJet founder to Dublin to fight copyright 'thieves'; Stelios Haji-Ioannou plans to pursue litigation in Irish courts Irish Independent June 8, 2023 Thursday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: BUSINESS WEEK;NEWS; Pg. 1 Length: 403 words Byline: John Mulligan Body   BREXIT has forced billionaire EasyJet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou to establish an intellectual property leasing firm in Ireland so his EasyGroup business can pursue legal cases across the European Union against "thieves" that illegally use the 'Easy' moniker, the Irish Independent has learned. The entrepreneur established EasyGroup IP Ireland here last month. Mr Haji-Ioannou confirmed to the Irish Independent that the firm has been set up in Ireland due to the impact of Brexit, which saw the United Kingdom formally leave the European Union in 2020. "The main reason for incorporating a wholly-owned subsidiary of our UK company in Ireland is to pursue litigation against brand thieves in the Irish courts in the post-Brexit European Union," he said. He added: "We have no current plans to transfer any IP (intellectual property) into the Irish company." He declined to say how much EasyGroup's intellectual property is valued at. "The right to take legal action will be created by having a brand licence between parent and subsidiary company," according to Mr Haji-Ioannou. Mr Haji-Ioannou established EasyJet in 1995 when he was 28 years old. The airline flourished and in 2000 it floated on the stock market, valuing it at almost £800m. Today it has a market capitalisation of £3.6bn ((EURO)4.2bn). The Haji-Ioannou family still controls just over 15pc of Easy- Jet. EasyGroup retains all the intellectual property ownership for the 'Easy' brand. Easy- Jet pays EasyGroup a quarter of a penny for every pound the airline generates in top line revenue as a licence fee. With respect to EasyJet's 2022 financial year, that amounted to £14.4m ((EURO)16.8m). EasyGroup controls a range of brands including www.EasyHotel.com, www.EasyStorage.com and www.EasyMoney.com. EasyGroup spokesman Richard Shackleton told the Irish Independent that the need to establish the Irish unit was "one of those curveballs that got thrown up by Brexit". "The problem we had was that Brexit removed our legal identity as far as the European Union was concerned," he said. "To re-establish that legal identity, we've had to set up this company in Ireland, which basically shares the IP (intellectual property) ownership with the English company." He added at any one time, EasyGroup is battling about a dozen cases of alleged copyright infringement in courts in the UK or Europe. At any one time, the firm is fighting about a dozen cases in court Load-Date: June 8, 2023  End of Document
