   Trade is up so stop Brexit whining, says minister i-news June 30, 2023 First Edition  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 7 Length: 209 words Byline: Martina Bet and Ben Hatton Body   Total UK trade is up and Brexit scaremongering "just has to stop", a business minister has said. Nus Ghani told the Commons that trade in the UK is thriving post-Brexit, as she dismissed concerns about the effects of the country's withdrawal from the European Union as "scaremongering". Her remarks came in response to a question about the impact of Brexit on business and trade in the UK from Alba Party MP Neale Hanvey. Ms Ghani (inset) highlighted the regulatory sovereignty that the UK has gained after leaving the EU, insisting the ability to tailor regulations to suit the UK economy, support businesses and protect consumers has been a significant advantage. She said: "Having regained our regulatory sovereignty now that we have left the EU, we are now able to ensure that our regulation is tailored to the UK economy, supports our businesses and protects our consumers and having left a single market we can focus on UK trade with the world, [which] is up 24 per cent. "So the answer to this question is: the effect is total trade is up post-Brexit." However, Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath MP Mr Hanvey said "resilient and effective routes to market are essential for trade", arguing that "the congestion… in Dover is a significant barrier to effective trade".
