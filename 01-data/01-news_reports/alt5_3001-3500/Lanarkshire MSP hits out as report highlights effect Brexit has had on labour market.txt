   Lanarkshire MSP hits out as report highlights effect Brexit has had on labour market dailyrecord.co.uk July 23, 2023 Sunday 3:50 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: TOPIC -HAMILTON; Version:1 Length: 376 words Byline: By, Ross Thomson Highlight: The report, published earlier this month , stated that the UK's labour market is facing high rates of economic inactivity, "driven up as a result of the pandemic and the ending of freedom of movement". Body                        Hamilton's MSP has hit out over a new report from the Work and Pensions committee which highlighted the damage Brexit is having on the UK's labour market.  The report, published earlier this month , stated that the UK's labour market is facing high rates of economic inactivity, "driven up as a result of the pandemic and the ending of freedom of movement". In addition, in line with the latest ONS figures, the report also found that human health and social care sectors are experiencing the highest number of vacancies, which has "been further compounded by the end of freedom of movement".                      Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse MSP Christina McKelvie has said it is now "clearer than ever" that independence is the only way to secure economic prosperity for Scotland.  She said: "This report from the Work and Pensions committee hammers home the dire impact Westminster's Brexit obsession is having on Scotland's economy, our NHS and our social care services. "And yet -despite the increasing mountain of evidence and more than half of voters across these islands saying they would vote to rejoin the EU -both the Tories and pro-Brexit Labour remain committed to this destructive decision. "Every single council area in Scotland voted against Brexit. We chose to remain part of the European Union and world's largest single market -but we were dragged out against our will. "However, for as long as both Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer deny the people of Scotland their democratic right to choose, the stronger the democratic case for Scottish independence will become. "At the next election, voters can be in no doubt that only the SNP are offering hope of a better future through independence -which offers a return to the European Union."
