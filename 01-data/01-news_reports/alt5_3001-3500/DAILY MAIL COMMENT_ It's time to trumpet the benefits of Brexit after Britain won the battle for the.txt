   DAILY MAIL COMMENT: It's time to trumpet the benefits of Brexit after Britain won the battle for the new Jaguar Land Rover battery plant MailOnline July 20, 2023 Thursday 10:44 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Or that it would trigger a flight of multi-national companies from these shores? Two announcements this week have given the lie to both those shibboleths, while hammering home the tangible benefits of leaving the EU. Tata Group, the Indian conglomerate which owns Jaguar Land Rover, will construct its £4 billion electric car battery plant in Somerset, creating thousands of skilled jobs. The firm considered locating the cutting-edge factory in Spain. But thanks to Brexit, Britain won the battle. Unshackled from the bloc, we were able to provide subsidies quickly, rather than getting bogged down for years by the deadening bureaucracy in Brussels. The second Brexit bonus was joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trading alliance which generates 13 per cent of global income. Stuck in the economically-calcifying EU, striking such an exciting deal would have been forbidden. Predictably, the anti-Brexit brigade - led inevitably by Labour and the BBC - belittles these achievements. Obsessive hatred of Britain's newly restored sovereignty blinds them to any advantages it brings. But couldn't the Government at least trumpet the benefits? There have, after all, been notable successes: The vaccine rollout and our early, strong support for Ukraine to name but two. We know Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is a Remainer. But it is inexplicable that Brexiteer Rishi Sunak seems so reluctant to champion and exploit it. Brexit is not just about constructing new commercial and diplomatic relationships around the world. It is about imagining and building the country Britain can be in this new, exciting era. Despite at times being disappointed by our politicians' lack of ambition, the Mail remains convinced of its almost limitless potential. The PM should embrace it. For if the project flops, it will be seen as a catastrophic Tory failure.                      Can't BBC say sorry?                    Whenever a media organisation finds itself in hot water after making a mistake, what a commotion the BBC causes. Clambering aboard its moral high horse, it howls with outrage and demands apologies. But if the corporation gets something badly wrong, it is not so quick to wear sackcloth. Take the Coutts scandal. Nigel Farage suggested last month that the private bank had closed his account due to his political views. But the Remainer-packed BBC gleefully claimed it was because the ex-Ukip leader was no longer wealthy enough. This turned out to be a pack of lies, briefed by the bank itself. It is outrageous that the BBC behaved less like the state broadcaster, and more like Coutts' spin doctor. Of course, no one should be surprised. The 'woke' values the bank flaunts are shared entirely by the corporation. The financial bullying of Mr Farage was an assault on free speech.                      Last night, he received a mealy-mouthed apology from the boss of NatWest, which owns Coutts. Is it too much to hope for the BBC to also say sorry?                      Eco-egos out-clowned                    Just Stop Oil activists plainly get a perverse thrill from disrupting our lives. So how satisfying that these eco-clowns got a taste of their own medicine when a planned 'slow walk' road demo in London was thwarted by a counter-protest. True, the heroes were YouTube pranksters. But a serious point remains. If politicians and police continue to twiddle their thumbs as environmental doom cults bring chaos, there is a risk the public will take the law into their own hands.
