Who needs experts? George Emslie (Letters, July 17) delivers another inaccurate and nonsensical mishmash. Facts never impinge on beliefs: provocative hyperbole preferred to pragmatism. We got "Brexit done" but still await the spoils. An impatient Mr Emslie blames a "wily" EU! Realising there are no sunlit uplands the electorate has come to its senses, with 57% of those surveyed by YouGov now saying that leaving the EU was wrong. Tory Tobias Elwood, asserts: "We must admit Brexit is a mistake and rejoin the single market". Joining the CPTPP will have a minimal impact. Will there ever be a trade deal with the US? Britain accounts for 2% of global manufacturing and 2% of global R&D. We're not a superpower! Professor David Edgerton postulates "the good thing about Brexit was that it would destroy national illusions", advising "the UK needs a politics of modesty." A welcome contrast to the chest-beating stridency exhibited by Brexiteers. Mr Emslie blames the EU for the Illegal Immigration Migration Bill not working, oblivious of France's offer to open a processing centre. Is he unaware both France and Germany take more asylum seekers than Britain? Brexiteer George Eustace admits Britain needs more EU workers to ease labour shortages. Mr Emslie, it's time to confront reality. Ian D McCormick, Aboyne. Load-Date: October 26, 2023  End of Document
