All Rights Reserved Copyright 2023 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved Length: 1229 words Body          To learn about the legal and historical arguments of Argentine sovereignty over the Malvinas, Georgias and South Sandwich Islands is the central axis of the governmental course for workers of the three branches of the national government, which will begin next week, within the framework of a series of activities organized by the Foreign Ministry for the Sovereignty Day. Next Wednesday, some 2,000 employees of different state agencies will start a training course on the Malvinas issue with the aim of deepening the awareness of Argentine rights over the South Atlantic archipelago. The course takes place within the framework of Law 27.671, which establishes mandatory training for all State personnel and which was announced and launched last November 6 by Chancellor Santiago Cafiero during a ceremony attended by other members of the national cabinet. "The fact is very significant because it aims at training all public officials of the three branches of the national government", said Guillermo Carmona, Secretary of Malvinas, Antarctica and South Atlantic of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a conversation with Télam. Carmona highlighted the "strong interest" that the course aroused among public workers, who in the first registration in less than 48 hours sold out the available space.  In addition to this training for government workers, the Foreign Ministry is preparing a series of other activities within the framework of Sovereignty Day, ranging from academic meetings and talks with Malvinas war veterans in different parts of the country, to the dissemination of the Bicontinental Map of Argentina through different platforms.     The training, which will begin on November 22, aims to provide the "legal and historical arguments" of Argentine sovereignty over the Malvinas, Georgias and South Sandwich Islands, usurped by the British since 1833, said Carmona. "Every year the Sovereignty Day is a day of high relevance in the agenda of our Secretariat", said the official about the date that commemorates the Battle of the Vuelta de Obligado, fought on November 20, 1845, a historical milestone in which Argentine soldiers repelled the invasion of the Anglo-French army, making their intended colonization fail. The official traced a common thread between that heroic battle fought by the national troops, under the command of Lucio Mansilla, with other historical antecedents of aggression of foreign forces against our country. In this sense, he analyzed that the Vuelta de Obligado "refers to the heroic resistance of the people of Buenos Aires against the English invasions of 1806 and 1807", as well as the "illegal British occupation" of the Malvinas Islands in 1833. For Carmona, the British military invasion on January 3, 1833, which began with the expulsion of the Argentine authorities and population that inhabited the islands, places our country in "the key of defense of Argentine sovereignty in its traditional facet but also in its political, economic and cultural facet". Regarding the present of Argentina's relationship with the United Kingdom, he highlighted the "enormous relevance" of the proposal made by the Argentine Government to the British Government to open a "new agenda on the Malvinas Question". In an assessment of the progress made by Argentine diplomacy in recent years regarding the Malvinas sovereignty claim, Carmona highlighted the decision of the national government to leave without effect the so-called Foradori-Duncan pact, which represented a set of conditions "contrary to the national interest" and valued the international support achieved. Last July the European Union signed an agreement with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) which mentions the islands as "Malvinas" and not by their British denomination (Falkland Islands) and which recognizes the archipelago as a "disputed territory" and no longer as a "European overseas territory". The historic declaration, which the Argentine government described as a "fundamental milestone", prospered in spite of the pressures exerted by England to hinder a mention of the sovereignty dispute over the South Atlantic archipelago. The secretary linked that fact to the exclusion of the Falklands from the post-Brexit trade agreement between the EU and the UK and the increasingly evident withdrawal of European support for British colonial policy. On January 1, 2020, the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) was consummated and the Falkland Islands ceased to be part of its Constitution; this legal vacuum helped to pave the way for Argentina to gain support from countries of the old continent. With Great Britain out of the European community, its overseas colonial enclaves no longer had the protection of the Lisbon Treaty, which gave them the same status as a state party. In addition, by being excluded from the post-Brexit trade agreement between the EU and the UK, the archipelago lost trade, tax and customs benefits in the exchange of the islanders with the countries of the community bloc. Carmona assessed that the Brexit represented, then, an "opportunity" that Argentina "could take advantage of" in its objective of revitalizing its claim for the sovereignty of the South Atlantic archipelago. "The Brexit for Argentina has been an opportunity that we have already been able to take advantage of with two concrete situations: on the one hand, the regime of tariff benefits for Malvinas fishing illegally carried out by the United Kingdom fell." On the other hand, he said, he configured a "propitious" scenario for the Celac-EU agreement regarding Malvinas, among pronouncements of other instances of the old continent. In this sense, he mentioned the introduction of the Malvinas Question in a recent bilateral declaration between Argentina and the EU and the pronouncement, in the same sense, of the Eurolat (European-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly), within the framework of the summit held last year in Buenos Aires. Therefore, Carmona warned that another important "condition" in the diplomatic action deployed by Argentina "is to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the international scenario". "The claims of countries whose territorial integrity has been affected have generally been resolved when international conditions have made it possible, when opportunities have arisen", said the official. From this perspective, he reaffirmed that Argentina "must continue to explore what the opportunities are and operate on those opportunities", as was done with the Brexit. Two days before the presidential candidates Sergio Massa (Unión por la Patria) and Javier Milei (La Libertad Avanza) will run for president next Sunday, the Secretary pointed out the importance of "continuing the path" traced by the current administration regarding Malvinas and "achieving the objective set by the Constitution to recover the full exercise of sovereignty over those territorial spaces". To this end, he stated the need to continue with the strategy of "persistently making visible" the Malvinas issue in the world as a "pending case of colonialism", in order to obtain the "international support" that will force the United Kingdom to resume negotiations for the sovereignty of the archipelago, as ordered by the United Nations General Assembly in different resolutions.
