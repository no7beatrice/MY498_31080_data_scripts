   Brain drain since Brexit Liverpool Echo June 3, 2023 Saturday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 16,17 Length: 263 words Body   BECAUSE of the teacher shortage in this country, the Department for Education has set up a recruitment drive and is offering £10,000 "international relocation payments" to overseas teachers to cover visa and moving expenses. Problems created by the Tories: teachers are not getting paid enough to encourage them to enter the profession or stay in the profession. That is why we have a shortage. I doubt that £10,000 would be enough to lure anyone here for what we have to offer them. EU nationals in the profession have gone home or are not coming because of Brexit. Indeed I know personally of two people who have left the teaching profession here because of Brexit. One is an EU national who has returned to his country of origin. The other is a UK citizen who didn't want to live in a post-Brexit Britain. The reality is that, since Brexit, we've had a real brain drain of both EU and UK citizens. Why does the government keep banging on about the need to reduce net migration when it keeps increasing because that same government is going on worldwide recruitment drives because we actually need migrant workers? It's not just teachers we're short of. There have been recruitment drives for doctors and nurses too. Another aspect of this that needs consideration is that the decision to actively recruit from third world countries where these people have been trained and where they are needed hardly seems fair and right... but that's the Tories for you. Good luck to them in filling the job vacancies and reducing net migration. Looks like a bit of an oxymoron to me. Sue Quinlan, Anfield Load-Date: June 3, 2023  End of Document
