   Zuckerberg and Twitter chief grilled over child safety telegraph.co.uk January 31, 2024 Wednesday 7:05 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: BUSINESS; Version:1 Length: 11897 words Byline: By Chris Price and Alex Singleton Body   Mark Zuckerberg was told he has “blood on his hands” as bosses of the world’s largest social media platforms defended their records on child safety to Congress in a blockbuster hearing. The chief executives of Facebook owner Meta, TikTok and X were testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about child exploitation on their platforms. Campaigners argue lax safeguards mean children are being exposed to addictive features, bullying, unrealistic beauty standards and content on self-harm and eating disorders. Committee ranking member Senator Lindsey Graham told Mr Zuckerberg “you have blood on your hands” and that criminals had turned social media platforms “into a nightmare”. In a heated question and answer session with MR Zuckerberg, Republican senator Josh Hawley asked the Meta chief if he has personally compensated any of the victims and their families for what they have been through. “I don’t think so,” Zuckerberg replied. “There’s families of victims here,” Mr Hawley said. “Would you like to apologise to them?” Parents attending the hearing rose and held up pictures pictures of their children. Zuckerberg stood as well, turning away from his microphone and the senators to address them directly. “I’m sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should go through the things that your families have suffered,” he said, adding that Meta continues to invest and work on “industry-wide efforts” to protect children. It comes as documents and emails released by Congress showed Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg rejected requests from Sir Nick Clegg to employ more people to work on child safety. The then vice president of global affairs told the Meta chief executive in an email: “From a policy perspective, this work has become increasingly urgent over recent months. “Politicians in the US, UK, EU and Australia are publicly and privately expressing concerns about the impact of our products on young people’s mental health.” Sir Nick’s August 2021 request to hire 45 more people to work on child safety was not approved.

We’ll be back in the morning but I’ll leave you with two of our latest business stories: Vodafone rejects €10.5bn merger bid by French billionaire Mike Lynch sues SFO after extradition to US for fraud trial                      31 Jan 2024-07:04PM GMT                                         No change to US interest rates                    The Federal Reserve has held interest rates at 5.25 to 5.5pc while warning that it is too early to get hopeful about rate cuts. Our reporter Eir Nolsøe has the details: It comes as traders on Thursday will be watching the Bank of England closely as its rate-setters vote on whether to start bringing down borrowing costs from a 16-year-high. The US central bank said that even as several indicators point to easing price pressures, it can not yet declare victory in the battle against inflation. The Fed said in a statement: “The Committee does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent.” The central bank reiterated warnings that it was prepared to adjust interest rates “if risks emerge”. It comes after inflation rose by more than anticipated in December to 3.4pc amid higher costs for housing, eating out and car insurance. The US economy has proved remarkably resilient in the face of borrowing costs rising at the fastest pace since the 1980s. The S&P500 immediately fell by as much as 1pc after the Fed issued its statement warning markets against expecting rate cuts imminently.                      31 Jan 2024-06:49PM GMT                                         Senate hearing concludes                    Senator Dick Durbin, the chair, is now wrapping up the proceedings, giving Mark Zuckerberg the “advice” that he needs to improve what he says on mental health.                      31 Jan 2024-06:44PM GMT                                         Senator challenges social media firms on cuts to moderation staff                    Senator Peter Welch has expressed concern that social media platforms seemed to be cutting staff working on moderating content. But X chief Linda Yaccarino said that trust and security staff have increased at least 10pc during the past 14 months after a big restructuring. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said that while there had been redundancies more generally at Meta, he said his group’s investment in such staff had remained consistent.                      31 Jan 2024-06:36PM GMT                                         Senator says Facebook is wrong to give small 'lifetime value' to young users                    Senator Marsha Blackburn spoke about internal Meta documents that described young users being worth $270 (£212) in lifetime value. This is a standard measurement used by marketers across industries to measure the income they will receive for acquiring a customer. However, the senator said that children were worth more than $270.                      31 Jan 2024-06:30PM GMT                                         Would Facebook like children to use the platform more or less, asks senator                    Senator Jon Ossoff asked the founder of Facebook if he would like children to use the platform more or less.  Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg pushed back on the question, saying that Facebook was only for use by those aged 13 and above. But he added that he would like to make the platform useful enough that teenagers want to use the platform more. Mr Ossoff told Zuckerberg that the internet was “a dangerous place for children ... and your platforms are dangerous places for children”. Mr Zuckerberg rejected the idea that his products were “inherently dangerous”.                      31 Jan 2024-06:20PM GMT                                         Senator says that 'every year we've had an annual flogging' of social media companies                    In a change of perspective, Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican, said that “every year we’ve had an annual flogging” of social media companies. “We could regulate you out of business if we wanted to.” But he noted that it was possible for users to sidestep the US social media companies. If the platforms fail to get standards right “the bad actors are just going to be off our shores,” he said. “The evil people will find another way to get to our children.” He highlighted the benefits of social media platforms. “Let’s not throw out the good.”                      31 Jan 2024-06:06PM GMT                                         Kennedy says social media plans are 'like putting paint on rotting wood'                    Senator John Kennedy has accused Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg of creating “cesspools are snark” in remarks aimed at social media executives: Can we agree what you do is what you believe and that everything else is just cottage cheese? I’ve heard a lot of yada, yada, yada, and I’ve heard a lot about the reforms you’ve made ... but I don’t think you’re going to solve the problem ...  Some of the reforms are like putting paint on rotting wood ... you’re not companies, you’re countries-you’re very, very powerful. Your platforms are hurting children... He then challenged Mark Zuckerberg, saying that his platforms are “killing field for the truth” because the algorithm does not give both sides of a debate, creating “cesspools are snark”. Mr Zuckerberg rejected the characterisations.                      31 Jan 2024-05:47PM GMT                                         EBay to pay $59m after drug-making machines were allegedly sold on it                    While the Senate committee takes a break, one other tech firm is feeling the head this afternoon. Online auction company eBay is to pay $59m (£46m) to the US government after it was alleged that its website allowed thousands of machines to be sold that let criminals manufacture illegal drugs. The US Department of Justice alleged that eBay was in breach of the Controlled Substances Act, which restricts the sale of pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment. It requires the identities of buyers to be verified and for details to be reported to the US Drug Enforcement Administration. “These requirements are designed to prevent individuals who intend to use these machines illegally from obtaining them and to ensure that the machines are traceable to the end user,” the Department of Justice said in a statement. Regulators also alleged that buyers were able to use eBay to purchase “counterfeit moulds, stamps, or dies, allowing them to produce pills that mimicked the products of legitimate pharmaceutical companies”. EBay said: Maintaining a safe and trusted marketplace for our global community of sellers and buyers is a fundamental principle of our business. EBay is proud of its well-recognised, proactive and voluntary efforts to remove the products that were the subject of the government’s inquiry from our marketplace. While eBay acted lawfully and denies the DOJ’s allegations, we determined that this agreement is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders as it avoids the costs, uncertainty and distraction associated with protracted litigation.                      31 Jan 2024-05:37PM GMT                                         'The agent of Chinese Communist Party' hosts Democratic content                    Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican, has been asking questions about whether there are links between TikTok, which he claimed was “poisoing the minds” of American children, the Biden administration and the Democratic party. The senator, who alleged that TikTok was “the agent of Chinese Communist Party”, suggested that it was odd that TikTok is not being sued by the Biden administration unlike some of the other social media platforms. He tried to suggest closeness between TikTok and the Biden administration. He noted that the Democrats use TikTok to promote their messages, and asked TikTok’s Shou Chew about whether the Democrats were getting favourable promotion on the platform Mr Shou Chew rejected all this and said that they welcomed everyone to use their platform.                      31 Jan 2024-05:28PM GMT                                         'Have you ever been a member of the Chinese Communist Party?'                    Senator Tom Cotton is putting the pressure on TikTok’s Shou Chew, first challenging him on what obligations the company has to the Chinese Communist Party. Then the senator repeatedly asked Mr Chew about his nationality. The answer is that he has citizenship from Singapore, where he lives, and has never applied for Chinese citizenship. “Have you ever been a member of the Chinese Communist Party?” No, came the answer.                      31 Jan 2024-05:23PM GMT                                         Elon Musk's X gets warmest reception from senators                    Given all the controversy over Elon Musk’s ownership of X social media platform, it’s notable that Linda Yaccarino, the chief executive of X, has seemed to receive the warmest response from senators. She has been unequivocal in supporting legislation that the committee members advocate.                      31 Jan 2024-05:15PM GMT                                         'Your product is killing people', claims senator in heated exchange                    There’s lots of grandstanding from Senator Josh Hawley.  “Will you set up a victims’ compensation fund?”, he asked Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, referring to users whose mental health had allegedly been affected from using Meta’s platforms. “You’ve done nothing to help them, you’ve done nothing to compensate them ... you should!” Then he turned to Shou Chew, asking him to give a reason why TikTok should not be banned in America. Mr Chew pointed to the separation of US users’ data. “Your app ought to be banned,” the senator concluded.                      31 Jan 2024-05:08PM GMT                                         Meta is a 'disaster for teenagers' claims senator                    Senator Josh Hawley asked Mark Zuckerberg about his views of the connection between social media use and mental health. Referring what he said was internal Meta research, he said Meta’s products were a “disaster for teenagers”, which generated applause from the audience. Mr Zuckerberg denied the suggestion saying that the senator had “mischaracterised” the research.                      31 Jan 2024-05:00PM GMT                                         Mark Zuckerberg gets close to snapping under tough questioning                    Mark Zuckerberg has dozens of hours of Congressional hearings under his belt, but this is the closest he has come to snapping, writes James Titcomb. Peppered with multiple questions by US Senator Ted Cruz about the company’s work on preventing child sexual abuse material, he raises his voice ever so slightly, saying: “Do you want me to answer the question… could you give me some time to speak then?”                      31 Jan 2024-04:58PM GMT                                         Senator Cruz challenges TikTok over alleged suppression of Hong Kong protests                    Senator Cruz, in continued heated questioning, turned to TikTok’s Shou Chew. He repeatedly asked questions over what he suggested was a suppression of content in the US around the Hong Kong protests. Shou Chew denied the allegation, saying the analysis the senator was referrring to had been debunked.                      31 Jan 2024-04:53PM GMT                                         Heated questioning to Zuckerberg over Instagram warning                     Senator Ted Cruz increased the heat in his questioning of Mark Zuckerberg over a warning message displayed on Instagram that reads: “These results may contain images of child sexual exploitation”. Mr Zuckerberg said the reason the error message lets people view the images anyway is the message may be displayed by error. He said that they take action to remove inappropriate images from the platform.                      31 Jan 2024-04:47PM GMT                                         'There is a problem with accountability' says committee chairman                    Senator Dick Durbin gave a speech about the lack of accountability by social media companies. He pointed to legislation, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, “which provides immunity from lawsuit”. He said he wanted the social media companies to put in writing what exemptions to Section 230 they would be willing to accept. They all agreed.                      31 Jan 2024-04:39PM GMT                                         Can 'end-to-end encryption' be used by children, asks senator                    Senator Mike Lee has asked social media bosses about whether they let under-18s to use end-to-end encyrption. Mark Zuckerberg said those aged 13-18 could use end-to-end encryption on WhatsApp, but said they did not allow users below that age range. Mr Zuckerberg said that they had changed their policy on self-harm content. Previously the thinking had been that it was best to let people express their feelings so that help could be offered whereas now the thinking is that is best for that content to never be allowed.                      31 Jan 2024-04:26PM GMT                                         Facebook rejected Sir Nick Clegg's call for extra child safety staff                    Ahead of the hearing, two senators released 90 pages of internal Meta documents asking Mark Zuckerberg for more resources to focus on child’s safety, writes James Titcomb.  In one case, Mr Zuckerberg rejected a request from Sir Nick Clegg, Meta’s head of global affairs, for 45 new staff to cover child safety. Sir Nick said the company was failing to meet goals to tackle bullying on Instagram and Facebook and said the investment would allow Meta to “stand behind our external narrative of well-being”.                      31 Jan 2024-04:18PM GMT                                         TikTok says it has never shared US data with the Chinese government                    Senator John Cornyn has asked TikTok’s Shou Chew about what has happened to data from US users that was created before it starting storing US users’ data in Oracle’s facilities in America. Mr Chew said they had a data deletion plan in motion and said that it was not true that TikTok had ever shared US users’ information with the Chinese government.                      31 Jan 2024-04:15PM GMT                                         Mark Zuckerberg says app stores should manage parental consent                    Senator Amy Klobuchar has asked Mark Zuckerberg whether he supports proposed pieces of legislation. “I agree with the goal of all of them”, he said, but said that Meta also has ideas for legislation. Mr Zuckerberg said he don’t think that parents should have to upload documents proving parental consent every time a child does something online. Instead, he said the best place to do this is through app stores. He also said that Meta has no plans for a children’s Instagram.                      31 Jan 2024-04:07PM GMT                                         Social media companies have 'turned a blind eye' over child use, claims senator                    Senator Amy Klobuchar has accused social media giants of allowing drugs to be sold by users of their platforms, and spoke of the problem of online revenge porn. She said she agreed with Senator Graham that noting would change until it was possible to sue social media companies for the consequences from people using their platforms. “We know that 30pc” of people getting fentanyl are getting it through social media, she claimed.                      31 Jan 2024-04:01PM GMT                                         This committee is done with talking, says Senator Lindsey Graham                    Lindsey Graham declared that “this committee is done with talking” as he spoke of the need for social media companies to “loose your liability protections” through the so-called Earn-It Act. He expressed concern that the social media companies were not in favour of the act, before asking X’s Linda Yaccarino if she supported it. She initially sidestepped the question before saying that she looked forward to engaging over the act and supporting it in the future. Until social media companies can be sued, there is a problem, he said. “That has to stop,” he said, adding that social media companies needed to be accountable.                      31 Jan 2024-03:55PM GMT                                         Notably missing: Google and Apple                    Notable in the opening statement, writes technology editor James Titcomb, was that Mark Zuckerberg focused his attention on two companies that are not here: Google and Apple, which runs the two major smartphone app stores. He called for age verification on the two stores and for requirements that parents vet apps that are downloaded onto teenagers’ phones. “Parents should have the final say and shouldn’t have to update their ID every time-that’s what app stores are for,” he said. Snap’s Evan Spiegel appeared to agree: he said that his wife approves every app that their 13-year-old son downloads on their phone.                      31 Jan 2024-03:53PM GMT                                         Key witnesses at the Congress hearing: Shou Zi Chew and Mark Zuckerberg                                         31 Jan 2024-03:50PM GMT                                         X's Linda Yaccarino: Freedom of speech and platform safety can co-exist                    Linda Yaccarino gave strong support for several pieces of recent US legislation used to protect children online. She said that freedom of speech is not in conflict with action to protect safety.                      31 Jan 2024-03:45PM GMT                                         X's Linda Yaccarino: 'as a mother this is personal'                    Linda Yaccarino, who was brought in by Elon Musk to manage the social media formerly known as Twitter is currently speaking. She opened by claiming that “X is an entirely new company” that is an “indespensible company” for the world and democracy. She said that X is not a platform of choice for children and “as a mother this is personal”. Less than 1pc of the US users are between 13 and 17, she added. “X has zero tolerance” towards child sexual exploitation. She spoke about hiring more staff in Texas to help protect children.                      31 Jan 2024-03:39PM GMT                                         Snap and TikTok major on their support for online safety                    Snap’s Evan Spiegel spoke in opening remarks on his company’s support for law enforcement and the efforts the app puts into the responsible promotion of content. It’s a theme that has also been picked up by Shou Zi Chew, currently speaking, who says that safety is one of the key responsibilities under his leadship. He says the app has 40,000 trust and safety staff.                      31 Jan 2024-03:29PM GMT                                         Zuckerberg: Technology can make parenting 'more complicated'                    Mark Zuckerberg has begun delivering his opening remarks to the Senate hearing, acknowledging that “being a parent is one of the hardest jobs in the world” and that technology can make it “more complicated”. He said: “We are on the side of parents everywhere looking to raise their kids.” He pointed to measures put in place on Instagram to remind teenagers when they have been online for some time, and making all profiles of under 16s private. He said it is “important to look into effects of teenage mental health and wellbeing”. He ended by recognising families who have lost loved ones, saying he is “committed to working in these areas and I hope we can make progress today”. With that, I will hand over reporting duties to my colleague Alex Singleton.                      31 Jan 2024-03:24PM GMT                                         Senators promise cross-party cooperation on social media legislation                    Republicans and Democrats are promising to work together on legislation in what appears to be a rare case of bipartisan co-operation, writes our technology editor James Titcomb.  But it should be noted that we have been talking about the downsides of social media for the best part of a decade, and no piece of national US legislation has been passed.  If the opening statement from Republican senator Lindsey Graham is anything to go by, that is about to change.                      31 Jan 2024-03:23PM GMT                                         Social media companies have duty to address criminality, says Discord boss                    Jason Citron, the co-founder and chief executive of Discord, is the first social media boss to speak to the hearing. He said: “There are people who abuse our platforms for immoral and illegal purposes.” He added social media companies have a duty to address this, adding as a father of two he wants his own children to be safe on Discord.                      31 Jan 2024-03:18PM GMT                                         Dark side of social media not dealt with, says senator                    Committee ranking member Senator Lindsey Graham said he was personally a user of Meta products, which include Facebook and Instagram. He said: “There is an upside to everything here but the dark side has not been dealt with. He added criminals had turned the platforms “into a nightmare for the American people”.                      31 Jan 2024-03:15PM GMT                                         Zuckerberg told ‘you have blood on your hands’ by senators                    Mark Zuckerberg has been told he has blood on his hands as he appeared in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing about child exploitation on social media. Committee ranking member Senator Lindsey Graham had talked about the story of a young man who had died by suicide after sending explicit photos unwittingly to criminals who tried to extort money from him.                      31 Jan 2024-03:09PM GMT                                         Social media companies put 'profit over safety'                    Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Dick Durbin said that social media companies had put “the pursuit of profit over safety”, which had put children at risk.

Committee chairman Senator Dick Durbin said the disturbing growth in child suicide was driven by changes in technology. He said: “Smart phones are in the pockets of seemingly every man, woman and children on the planet.” He added it could become a back alley for where lives of children “can be destroyed”.                      31 Jan 2024-02:56PM GMT                                         YouTube absent from Senate hearing                    Google’s YouTube is notably missing from the list of companies called to the Senate today.  The hearing will go ahead without a representative from the platform even though more kids use YouTube than any other social network, according to the Pew Research Center.  Pew found that 93pc of US teens use YouTube, with TikTok a distant second at 63pc. Larissa May, the founder and executive director of the nonprofit #HalfTheStory, said: The thing about YouTube is that it kind of flies under the radar. I think Meta has gotten so used to taking so much of the heat for the issues that young people are facing. But it’s actually much, much bigger than that.                      31 Jan 2024-02:41PM GMT                                         Social media chiefs line up for Senate grilling                    Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is expected to flag the more than 30 existing tools and features designed to help parents and teens avoid child exploitation on Facebook, according to a prepared testimony released ahead of today’s Senate hearing. The company has been beefing up its child safety features in recent weeks, announcing earlier this month that it will start hiding inappropriate content from teenagers’ accounts on Instagram and Facebook, including posts about suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.  Mr Zuckerberg is a veteran of congressional hearings since his first one over the Cambridge Analytica privacy debacle in 2018. However, it will only be the second time for TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew and the first for Linda Yaccarino, the chief executive of X, formerly known as Twitter.  Snap chief executive Evan Spiegel and Discord boss Jason Citron are also scheduled to testify.                      31 Jan 2024-02:37PM GMT                                         Wall Street mixed ahead of Fed rate decision                    US stock markets were mixed at the open ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s next decision on interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3pc after the opening bell to 38,566.51 while the S&P 500 was down 0.4pc to 4,905.31. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slumped 1pc to 15,359.63.                      31 Jan 2024-02:30PM GMT                                         Mortgage rates drop ahead of Bank of England decision                    Lenders have cut mortgage rates ahead of the Bank of England’s interest rate decision on Thursday. Our senior money reporter James Fitzgerald has the latest: On Tuesday Skipton Building Society reduced mortgage rates on residential and buy-to-let deals by up to 0.46 percentage points. The biggest cut is on the building society’s five-year fix rate buy-to-let loan, which fell from 4.95pc to 4.49pc. The lender dropped its five-year fix to 4.31pc. TSB also cut the rates on its various loans by up to 0.85pc, while Barclays cut the rate on some of its five-year fixed deals to 4.09pc earlier this week. The Bank’s monetary policy committee is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold  at 5.25pc at midday on Thursday. The central bank is tipped to start cutting rates this summer as inflation continues to rise at a slower rate in recent months.

The chief executives of Facebook owner Meta, TikTok and X will testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about child exploitation on their platforms. Campaigners argue lax safeguards mean children are being exposed to addictive features, bullying, unrealistic beauty standards and content on self-harm and eating disorders. It comes as documents and emails released by Congress showed Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg rejected requests from Sir Nick Clegg to employ more people to work on child safety. The then vice president of global affairs told the Meta chief executive in an email: “From a policy perspective, this work has become increasingly urgent over recent months. “Politicians in the US, UK, EU and Australia are publicly and privately expressing concerns about the impact of our products on young people’s mental health.” Sir Nick’s August 2021 request to hire 45 more people to work on child safety was approved.                      31 Jan 2024-02:04PM GMT                                         Car dealership to cut hundreds of jobs                    Car dealership Group 1 Automotive, which owns more than 70 car dealerships in the UK, is planning to cut hundreds of jobs across the country. The business said that it plans to reduce its UK headcount by around 10pc in the first quarter of this year, impacting about 300 people. According to fillings at Companies House, Group 1’s main UK subsidiary employed 3,409 people in 2022, the last year for which data is available. Chief executive of the US-based parent company Daryl Kenningham said:  We experienced challenges in our UK operations during the current quarter with used vehicles and recognise we have some work ahead of us to bring our costs back in-line with recent trends. We are focused on reducing costs in the UK in the first quarter of 2024, with an expectation of reducing our UK headcount by approximately 10pc. Of the company’s employees, 1,663 worked in its production arm in 2022, a further 1,253 in distribution and 493 in management and administration.                      31 Jan 2024-01:47PM GMT                                         Private sector hiring slows in US ahead of interest rate decision                    Private sector hiring in the United States fell more than anticipated in January in a sign the world’s biggest economy is cooling ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision. The United States added 107,000 jobs in the private sector this month, according to data from payroll business ADP, slowing from a revised 158,000 in December. Most of the job gains were in service-providing sectors including leisure and hospitality and trade, transport and utilities. ADP chief economist Nela Richardson said: “Progress on inflation has brightened the economic picture despite a slowdown in hiring and pay.” A resilient jobs market has helped to support consumers and, in turn, spending, which prompted the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to 23-year highs of 5.25pc to 5.5pc. ️ ADP job changer pay growth at 7.2% YoY-lowest since May '21.

The decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) “was due to the decrease in oil activities by 16.4pc, while non-oil activities and government activities grew by 4.3pc and 3.1pc respectively, on an annual basis”, the government’s General Authority for Statistics said. The world’s biggest crude exporter is trying to transition its economy away from fossil fuels under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 reform agenda, which aims to position Saudi Arabia as a tourism, business and sports hub. Oil giant Saudi Aramco-of which the government owns 90pc-had reported record profits in 2022 following the spike in oil prices spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.                      31 Jan 2024-01:23PM GMT                                         Boeing 'has much to prove' after first results since mid-air blowout                    Boeing has “much to prove” to regain the confidence of regulators and customers after a mid-air cabin-panel blowout of a 737 MAX aircraft, its boss has said. Chief executive Dave Calhoun said the plane maker will “go slow” as it faces a “serious challenge”. As expected, he did not offer a financial or delivery forecast for 2024, stating that the company must focus on delivering quality airplanes. Boeing narrowed its fourth-quarter loss to $30m and increased production of its best-selling plane just before one of them suffered a blowout of a side panel during a flight, an accident that has raised new safety concerns about the aircraft manufacturer. The loss reported Wednesday was smaller than Wall Street expected, and revenue beat forecasts.                      31 Jan 2024-01:12PM GMT                                         German inflation falls to lowest level in two years                    German inflation slowed sharply in January to its lowest level since mid-2021, official data showed, boosting hopes the European Central Bank may start to cut interest rates in the near future. Prices in Europe’s largest economy climbed 2.9pc in the year to January, down from a reading of 3.7pc in December, according to preliminary data from federal statistics agency Destatis. It comes after French inflation eased more than expected in January to reach its lowest level since before Russia invaded Ukraine. Europe’s second-largest economy saw inflation hit 3.4pc, slowing from 4.1pc in December, according to statistics agency Insee. Christine Lagarde, the President of the European Central Bank, has pushed back on market speculation for speedy interest rate cuts this year, with traders forecasting as many as six quarter-point rate reductions. However, Joachim Nagel, the president of Germany’s central bank and an ECB policymaker, said the eurozone has “tamed the greedy beast” of inflation. Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said: “National data published so far suggest that headline and core inflation in the euro-zone came down a little more than we had expected in January.  “This makes us more confident in our view that the ECB will begin cutting rates in April.” Germany Inflation Ratehttps://t.co/AZNsXwF4x5 pic.twitter.com/0uWPu5eWLi                      31 Jan 2024-01:04PM GMT                                         Government publishes post-Brexit deal on Northern Ireland                    The Government has published its deal aimed at restoring powersharing at Stormont-and it commits to removing the post-Brexit green lane for checking goods shipped from Great Britain to final destinations in Northern Ireland. The command paper-entitled Safeguarding The Union-commits to replacing the green lane, which currently requires a percentage of goods to be checked, with a “UK internal market system” that will govern the movement of goods that will remain within the UK. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there would be a new statutory duty in UK law to ensure that divergence from EU laws would not inhibit trade with Northern Ireland. He said:  In the Windsor Framework it only dealt with divergence in the case of a new EU law. What about a new law in Great Britain that maybe created a situation where their law was different from ours? That put a risk on our unfettered access to the UK market. We have protected that unfettered access. If that happens there will be a new statutory duty in law that the UK Government is required to deal with and resolve any problem that may arise because there is a potential change to UK law going forward. This piece by our Europe editor James Crisp outlines what the post-Brexit deal for Northern Ireland means.                       31 Jan 2024-12:55PM GMT                                         Wall Street braces for drop when trading begins                    The Nasdaq has fallen more than 1pc in premarket trading as tech giants Alphabet and Microsoft’s projections for rising AI costs disappointed investors ahead of the US interest rate decision later. Alphabet slumped 5.7pc ahead of the opening bell after the company reported holiday-season advertising sales below expectations and projected higher spending this year on items such as servers to power artificial intelligence. Microsoft lost 0.9pc after forecasting rising costs to develop new artificial-intelligence features that eclipsed a quarterly results beat. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said:  In the case of Alphabet, and perhaps Microsoft as well, the market is now getting the jitters that AI investments are going to keep piling up.  These companies have been signaling for a while that investment was needed, but it seems to have fallen on deaf ears until now. The focus was now on the Federal Reserve’s first monetary policy decision for this year at 7pm, where policymakers are widely expected to hold rates steady. In premarket trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1pc, the S&P 500 was down 0.5pc and the Nasdaq 100 was down 1.1pc.                      31 Jan 2024-12:49PM GMT                                         Taylor Swift record label pulls millions of songs from TikTok in row over fees                    Millions of songs by artists including Taylor Swift  and Adele will be pulled from TikTok after Universal Music Group attacked the social media app over fees. Our media reporter James Warrington has the details: Universal, which is the world’s largest record label, has been in talks with the Chinese-owned company to renew its existing licensing deal. But the talks have ended in a bitter row, meaning the contract will expire today and all music licensed by Universal will be pulled from the platform in the coming days. In a blistering open letter, Universal accused TikTok of attempting to “bully” and “intimidate” it into accepting terms worth less than the previous deal. It said: “Ultimately TikTok is trying to build a music-based business, without paying fair value for the music.” Read TikTok’s response.                       31 Jan 2024-12:09PM GMT                                         Novo Nordisk valuation breaks $500bn barrier amid weight loss drug frenzy                    Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk became the second-ever European company to pass $500bn (£394bn) in market value after an upbeat outlook for its blockbuster obesity drug. Novo crossed the milestone to reach a level only previously attained on the Continent by Dior owner LVMH.  The Danish pharma company has roared past the luxury-goods giant after it was thrust into the limelight with obesity treatments Wegovy and Ozempic.  Novo’s earnings sparked fresh optimism as the company said revenue could grow by as much as 26pc this year and operating profit by up to 29pc at constant exchange rates.  The drugmaker has struggled to keep up with demand for both Wegovy and Ozempic, which share the same active ingredient which suppresses appetite.  Novo shares have gained 60pc in the past year. They rose as much as 4.1pc in Copenhagen trading.                      31 Jan 2024-11:53AM GMT                                         Morrisons boss hails 'new chapter' for supermarket                    Morrisons’ new boss has vowed to “start a new chapter” for the supermarket as he warned of “so much more to do” to turnaround stores amid the battle with German discounters. Britain’s fifth-largest supermarket said full year revenues excluding fuel grew by 2.7pc to £14.9bn, a day after it revealed it is selling its 337 petrol forecourts in a £2.5bn deal that will help it cut its debt pile. Underlying profits grew 6.5pc to £970m as Kantar figures on Tuesday revealed Morrisons’ share of the market was down at 8.8pc in January, compared to 9.1pc the same time last year.  Aldi’s has risen to 9.3pc from 9.2pc, while Lidl’s is up at 7.5pc from 7.1pc. Chief executive Rami Baitiéh, the former boss of retailer Carrefour France who took charge in November, said: Reporting today our sixth consecutive quarter of like for like sales improvement is very positive.  But there is so much more we can do, and together with my colleagues, we are developing plans to reinvigorate, refresh and strengthen Morrisons and to start a new chapter – which begins with our customers.  Across the business we are listening hard to what our customers are telling us and taking action, and we are just beginning to see our customer satisfaction scores improve. This will be the bedrock of our next chapter.                      31 Jan 2024-11:39AM GMT                                         Osborne joins crypto platform Coinbase                    Former chancellor George Osborne has been fired as an adviser by the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase as it comes under increasing regulator scrutiny. The US crypto giant, which is embroiled in a battle with US regulators, said Mr Osbrone would bring “decades of experience both at the highest levels of government, and in international finance and fintech investing”.  Faryar Shirzad, chief policy officer at Coinbase, said:  We are pleased to have George join our council at an exciting time for us in the UK and globally.  George brings with him a wealth of experience in business, journalism and government.  We look forward to relying on his insights and experiences as we grow Coinbase around the world. The former chancellor added: “There’s a huge amount of exciting innovation in finance right now. Blockchains are transforming financial markets and online transactions. Coinbase is at the frontier of these developments.”                      31 Jan 2024-11:24AM GMT                                         Port Talbot job losses 'not for want of trying,' says Tata Steel boss                    The failure to find an alternative to the closure of blast furnaces at Port Talbot, which will lead to the loss of up to 2,800 jobs , is “not for want of trying” to keep them open, Tata Steel’s boss has told MPs. T V Narendran, the global chief executive of Tata Steel, told the Welsh Affairs Committee that he and his colleagues “fully appreciate” what the South Wales community has gone through in its efforts to keep the blast furnaces open. He said Tata was past the point of no return on its plans, having “done a lot of restructuring in the UK over the last 15 years”. He told MPs: It is not that we haven’t put in our bit as shareholders. I think everyone has tried. It is not for want of trying. But this is a global business. There are global issues which impact us. For us, it is more about ‘how do we preservee steel making in Port Talbot?’ That has been a common ask of everyone. Maybe the outcome is not what all of us wanted but at least we are preserving steelmaking in Port Talbot.  That is something that has been worth the effort but the transition is not easy.                      31 Jan 2024-11:10AM GMT                                         Steel job losses 'tip of the iceberg,' union official warns                    The loss of 2,800 jobs through the planned closure of blast furnaces at the biggest steel plant in the UK is just the “tip of the iceberg”, a union official has warned. Politicians, unions and executives from steel giant Tata are being questioned by MPs following the company’s decision to close its blast furnaces at Port Talbot in South Wales. Officials from Community, the GMB and Unite told the Welsh Affairs Committee that the job losses will be devastating for the local and national economy. Charlotte Brumpton-Childs from the GMB said the scale of job losses cannot be over-estimated. She said: The 2,800 job losses proposed are just the tip of the iceberg because of the knock-on effect on people who work in the logistic supply chain, nearby cafes where workers buy their bacon butties, and even dance schools attended by steelworkers’ children. We have one member who signed a mortgage agreement two weeks before this announcement was made, and a senior union rep in his late 20s who wants a job for the next 50 or 60 years. This is not a dying industry-it is vibrant and could be providing jobs for the next 100 years.                      31 Jan 2024-11:04AM GMT                                         Pound falls ahead of rate decision                    The pound has fallen against the dollar ahead of the next interest rate decisions by the US Federal Reserve today and the Bank of England tomorrow. Sterling was last down 0.2pc at $1.26 and had lost 0.1pc against the euro, which is worth 85p.                      31 Jan 2024-10:53AM GMT                                         Bank of England could cut interest rates from May, says Jefferies                    Interest rates could be cut from May, an investment bank has said, as bond yields ease back ahead of the next decision by the Bank of England. Government borrowing costs have eased slightly, with the yield on benchmark 10-year bonds, known as gilts, down slightly to 3.89pc.  UK yields, which move inversely to prices, have fallen 12 basis points in the last week but are up 36 basis points over the last month. Bond yields are seen as an indicator to interest rate moves. Ahead of the next interest rate decision by the Bank of England, Jefferies chief European economist Mohit Kumar said: No policy change is expected. We expect a vote split of 8-1 for no change, with one vote for a rate cut. We expect a dovish leaning from the press conference. The tone on inflation is likely to indicate a mini victory lap with the Bank of England satisfied with the path to lower inflation. However, it may be too soon to declare victory on inflation. The Governor is likely to keep policy action data dependent and have a flexible approach to the timing of rate cuts. We are going into the meeting with a bullish position in gilts. If inflation continues to slow down, we see the possibility of a May rate cut.                      31 Jan 2024-10:39AM GMT                                         EU trade friction the 'price' of sovereignty, says Leadsom                    Friction in the trading relationship with the European Union is the “price” the UK is paying to be a “sovereign state again” after Brexit, a Government minister has said. Dame Andrea Leadsom, a health minister and prominent Leave supporter, said businesses would have to “adapt” after the introduction today of new post-Brexit checks on food, drink and some agricultural imports, including fresh flowers. The long-delayed new rules are part of the Government’s introduction of a series of checks this year. Fears have been expressed about the disruption the changes could cause to supply chains, with MPs also warning that the new border regime could present “serious biosecurity risks” to the UK. Dame Andrea, a former business secretary, said traders were made aware that Brexit would mean leaving the European single market, resulting in “additional checks at the border”. “There was no surprise about that,” she told Sky News. In another interview with Times Radio, she added:  There is a huge new opportunity for the UK at the same time as continuing to trade, albeit with some friction (with the EU), which is the price you pay for leaving the single market and for being a sovereign state again. For me as a Brexiteer, I am still absolutely convinced that this is the right thing to do.                      31 Jan 2024-10:22AM GMT                                         Gas prices rise after deadly attacks in Middle East                    European wholesale gas prices have surpassed €30 per megawatt hour for the first time in a fortnight amid the rising tensions in the Middle East. Dutch front-month futures, the continent’s benchmark, gained as much as 6.2pc in early trading following a drone strike that killed US troops in Jordan over the weekend. The UK equivalent rose as much as 3.4pc to more than 75p per therm. Joe Biden blamed Iran for the attack which killed three US service personnel. Attacked by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the Red Sea have caused disruption to global shipping. However, gas prices have remained relatively subdued amid strong supply levels and a relatively mild winter.                      31 Jan 2024-10:06AM GMT                                         Labour will not reinstate cap on bankers’ bonuses, vows Rachel Reeves                    Labour would not reinstate the cap on bankers’ bonuses despite previously criticising the move, Rachel Reeves has said, prompting claims of a “flip flop on steroids”. Our political correspondent Amy Gibbons has the details: The shadow chancellor said she does not have “any intention” of bringing back the limit imposed by the EU  after the 2008 financial crisis to curb excessive risk-taking by City workers , as she wants to keep the industry “thriving”. Plans to ditch the cap at twice a banker’s annual salary were first announced by Liz Truss’ chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, in 2022, and taken forward by his successor, Jeremy Hunt. Mr Kwarteng said the move would encourage global banks to create jobs, invest and pay taxes in the City, warning that the bonus limit was pushing up basic salaries and driving activity outside Europe. Read why Labour’s approach was compared to a “dog food lasagne”.                       31 Jan 2024-09:52AM GMT                                         'Higher for longer' rates message could support pound, says Ebury                    Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, said the Bank of England will keep the possibility of future interest rate hikes alive when its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets tomorrow. He said: MPC members have widely pushed back against market expectations for cuts in recent communications, and governor Bailey will likely stress that it remains ‘too soon’ to think about policy easing during the press conference. Fresh economic projections will also be released. Recent data could warrant an upward revision to the 2024 growth forecast, although the view on inflation will likely remain largely unchanged.  We expect the message to be hammered home that rates will need to stay ‘higher for longer’, which could provide some support for GBP.                      31 Jan 2024-09:43AM GMT                                         PM pulls together bosses for new business council                    Rishi Sunak has launched a new business council, setting up regular meetings with top bosses, including the chief executives of BT, Rolls-Royce and Unilever. The newly-appointed council will be used to gain business perspectives on the global economic climate and government policy as the Prime Minister looks to generate investment and growth ahead of an election expected later this year. Mr Sunak said: Without the jobs, growth, and innovation created by UK firms, the country simply wouldn’t function. That’s why I’m getting businesses in for a regular update on how well we are doing in delivering for business – straight from the shop floor. Number 10 said participants included chief executives from Scottish Power, Lloyds Banking Group, Greggs and Nationwide. Last year’s business council met just three times.                      31 Jan 2024-09:31AM GMT                                         How to nail your tax return (with hours to go)                    Happy tax return day to all who celebrate-and fear not if you have left completing yours until the last minute. Our deputy money advice editor Danielle Richardsonexplains how to navigate HMRC’s requirements and avoid penalties.                       31 Jan 2024-09:11AM GMT                                         Fujitsu boss offers 'deepest apologies' to Horizon scandal victims                     Fujitsu’s chief financial officer Isobe Takeshi offered an apology to wrongfully convicted subpostmasters as his company reported its latest financial results. He told reporters:  I would now like to take this opportunity to offer a comment regarding the ongoing inquiry into the UK Post Office Horizon System, which has been covered widely in news reports and media globally since the beginning of the year. First and foremost, on behalf of the Fujitsu Group, I would like to convey our deepest apologies to the subpostmasters and their families, and reiterate that we regard this matter with the utmost seriousness. Our company’s UK subsidiary has been cooperating fully with the ongoing UK statutory inquiry, which has been investigating complex events that have unfolded over many years, and going forward we remain fully committed to offering our complete support and cooperation. I would also like to emphasize that our global board of directors is maintaining strict supervision over the matter, including the handling of the ongoing inquiry. It is our sincere hope that the inquiry allows for a swift resolution that ensures a just outcome for the victims.                      31 Jan 2024-09:07AM GMT                                         Fujitsu aims to pay 'appropriate compensation' to subpostmasters                    Bosses at Fujitsu have said the Japanese tech company will work out the appropriate amount of compensation it will pay to wrongfully convicted subpostmasters as the direction of an inquiry into the Horizon IT scandal “becomes clear”. Earlier this month, Fujitsu told MPs it will contribute to compensation payments to Post Office subpostmasters who were wrongfully convicted after failures in the Horizon IT software made it look like money was missing from their shops. Isobe Takeshi, chief financial officer, said today as the company reported its latest financial results:  In the UK, people are talking about paying compensation as possible. But as the direction of the inquiry becomes clear we want to work on appropriate compensation. We take this matter very seriously. We want the facts to become clear from the statutory inquiry.                      31 Jan 2024-09:02AM GMT                                         Chancellor wants people to keep more of their money, says minister                    Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will be seeking to “enable people to keep more of their hard earned cash” at the Budget “if he possibly can”, according a minister. Health minister Dame Andrea Leadsom was speaking after the International Monetary Fund warned that further tax cuts could risk the Government’s ability to invest money in the NHS and other vital services. Asked on LBC whether she wanted to see further tax cuts, Dame Andrea said:  I think there is no denying that tax cuts enable, facilitate economic growth. The ‘full expensing’ for businesses that the Chancellor introduced last year, the biggest ever tax cut, as I understand it, for businesses, will generate economic growth. And so I am a big fan of tax cuts but obviously I am not the Chancellor and cannot predict what steps he will be taking at the spring statement, which is quite soon now. But he will be looking to enable people to keep more of their hard earned cash if he possibly can.                      31 Jan 2024-08:47AM GMT                                         FTSE 100 flat amid underwhelming company results                    The FTSE 100 was subdued in early trading as it was dragged down by Vodafone and GSK and underwhelming results from major US technology companies. The UK’s blue-chip index was last flat having dipped as much as 0.2pc, with Vodafone slipping 3,3pc after telecom operator Iliad said its peer had rejected its revised proposal to merge their Italian businesses. Shares of GSK dipped as much as 1.2pc as the drugmaker reportedly lower annual profits, although it beat market estimates for fourth-quarter results. The midcap FTSE 250 shed 0.1pc, with Harbour Energy falling nearly 5pc after Goldman Sachs downgraded the oil and gas producer’s shares to “sell” from “buy”. Both the FTSE indexes were headed for their first monthly decline in three as investors scaled back bets of aggressive interest rate cuts the Bank of England and other central banks, with concerns about China’s slowing economy adding to the gloom. The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates this evening, with focus on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post-meeting press conference and any hints from policymakers on how soon the Fed could begin easing rates.                      31 Jan 2024-08:34AM GMT                                         Pound predicted to hit two-year high ahead of interest rate decision                    Investors expect the pound will rally to its highest level against the dollar in two years as the Bank of England proves to be slower at cutting interest rates than its peers. Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs thinks sterling will hit $1.30 and 84p per euro in the next few months as the US Federal Reserve and European Central Bank begin cutting interest rates. Strategist Isabella Rosenberg said the pound has “benefited considerably from the global disinflation trend and shift toward policy easing”. Meanwhile, PGIM Fixed Income warned that tax giveaways in the next Budget ahead of a general election could force the Bank of England to keep interest rates higher. Global investment strategist Guillermo Felices said: “There’s life in the pound.  “Currencies love a tight monetary policy and loose fiscal policy, and we’re getting a flavour of this in the UK.” The Bank of England is expected to hold interest rates at 16-year highs of 5.25pc tomorrow, with money markets predicting four quarter point cuts this year to take rates to 4.25pc. The Fed is expected to make five equivalent rate cuts and the European Central Bank is predicted to make six before the end of the year. The pound was last down 0.1pc against the dollar at $1.26 but up 0.1pc against the euro at 85p.                      31 Jan 2024-08:17AM GMT                                         H&M hires new boss as it struggles to boost sales                    H&M surprised investors with a new chief executive taking the role with immediate effect as the Swedish fashion retailer struggles to boost sales in a fiercely competitive market. Outgoing boss Helena Helmersson said she had decided to step down and leave H&M, saying the role has been very personally demanding. New chief executive Daniel Erver has worked for the group for 18 years in various roles. The world’s second-biggest listed fashion retailer after Inditex is aiming to reach an operating margin of 10pc this year and has focused on profitability rather than cutting prices. But H&M has struggled with its price-sensitive customers going to budget-friendly newcomer SHEIN, in addition to competition from Inditex’s Zara. H&M’s fourth-quarter operating profit margin fell to 7.2pc from 7.8pc in the third quarter.                      31 Jan 2024-08:05AM GMT                                         UK markets muted ahead of interest rate decision                    UK stock markets were subdued as trading began ahead of interest rate decisions by the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve. The FTSE 100 was flat at 7,666.88 while the midcap FTSE 250 fell 0.1pc to 19,326.46.                      31 Jan 2024-08:03AM GMT                                         GSK upgrades outlook as it boosts sales of RSV vaccine                    GSK has upgraded its outlook for the coming years after it managed blockbuster sales of its new RSV vaccine. Sales of the company’s respiratory syncytial virus jab, known as Arexvy, hit £1.2bn in 2023 in the first year it was launched.  The British pharmaceutical giant said it expects to generate more than £38bn of sales by 2031, up from a previous forecast of £33bn.  However, it reported a slump in profits, after a vast gain from the spin-off of its consumer healthcare unit Haleon skewed results of the previous year. Profit after tax tumbled to £4.9bn last year from £14.9bn in 2022, GSK said, sending its shares down 0.3pc as markets opened. Chief executive Emma Walmsley said: GSK delivered excellent performance in 2023, with clear highlights being the exceptional launch of Arexvy and continued progress in our pipeline.  We are now planning for at least 12 major launches from 2025, with new Vaccines and Specialty Medicines for infectious diseases, HIV, respiratory and oncology.  As a result of this progress and momentum, we expect to deliver another year of meaningful sales and earnings growth in 2024, and we are upgrading our growth outlooks for 2026 and 2031.  We remain focused on delivering this potential-and more-to prevent and change the course of disease for millions of people.                      31 Jan 2024-07:55AM GMT                                         Vodafone gives Italian merger the cold shoulder                    Vodafone turned its nose up at an offer of a €10.5bn (£9bn) merger of its Italian business with the empire of billionaire telecoms tycoon Xavier Niel. The London-listed telecoms giant failed to accept the proposal by Mr Niel’s Iliad Group which would have combined the two companies’ Italian businesses, creating what would be the “most innovative challenger” in the country. The proposed deal originally offered Vodafone half the share capital of the combined entity, as well as €6.5bn in cash and a €2bn shareholder loan. An improved offer to give Vodafone €6.6bn in cash was also not accepted.                      31 Jan 2024-07:40AM GMT                                         Santander warns falling interest rates will hit profits                    High street lender Santander has reported a 13pc rise in annual profits after being boosted by higher interest rates. The Spanish-owned UK lender posted pre-tax profits of £2.1bn for 2023, up from £1.9bn in 2022. But the group cautioned its profitability will be impacted this year, with lower net interest margins expected as interest rates are set to fall. The group also revealed a 36pc drop in money set aside for loan losses, to £206m, down from £321m in 2022, though it flagged a “modest” increase in borrowers falling behind with repayments.                      31 Jan 2024-07:37AM GMT                                         Obesity drug Wegovy drives huge profits at Novo Nordisk                    Novo Nordisk said its profits soared by 51pc last year as it continued to roll out its blockbuster obesity shot Wegovy around the world.  Europe’s most valuable company reported a net profit of 83.7bn krone (£9.6bn), which was higher than the 82.07bn krone forecast by analysts. Revenue could grow by as much as 26pc at constant exchange rates and operating profit by as much as 29%, the Danish pharmaceutical giant said.                      31 Jan 2024-07:29AM GMT                                         Estate agents hopeful for 'period of economic recovery'                    Nathan Emerson, chief executive of estate agent industry body Propertymark, said: The reported month on month increase in house prices will start to encourage homeowners to feel more confident that they can potentially make their next move.  2024 seems to be starting off more positive for the housing market, and let’s hope that trend continues.  If the Bank of England decide to bring down interest rates too, this should give sellers even more confidence and ease the pressure on affordability.  Hopefully this is the start of a period of economic recovery for the nation.                      31 Jan 2024-07:26AM GMT                                         Competition for properties is building, says Purplebricks boss                    As house prices showed their strongest improvement in a year, Sam Mitchell, chief executive of Purplebricks, said:  Confidence is returning to the housing market and we have seen the number of buyers, viewings and offers all increase dramatically through January as banks continue to actively compete on rates.  With the general election likely to take place later in the year than originally anticipated, there is enough certainty to prolong this strong start to 2024.  With the number of homes coming to the market up just 2pc year on year, competition for properties is building. It’s more of a sellers’ market now than we’ve seen since the Truss budget in 2022.  Assuming inflation continues to slow, we expect this upward trajectory in the market to continue until we enter the political uncertainty that inevitably comes with an election.                      31 Jan 2024-07:22AM GMT                                         'Attractive' mortgage rates have boosted demand, says agent                    Matt Thompson, head of sales at Chestertons, said: The gradual introduction of more attractive mortgage products boosted buyer confidence in January, resulting in more buyers entering the market.  This increase in activity was further driven by pent-up demand from house hunters who were unable to find a property last year and are motivated to finalise their search.  Sellers also feel more confident about attracting the right buyer for their home which led to a slight increase in the number of properties being put up for sale in January.                      31 Jan 2024-07:15AM GMT                                         House prices enjoy strongest gains in a year                    House prices had their strongest improvement in a year in a sign that increasing mortgage affordability and hopes about interest rate cuts are buoying the market, according to a lender. Property values slumped by 0.2pc in the 12 months to January, the Nationwide house price index showed, which was the best showing since the same month a year earlier, having fallen by 1.8pc in 2023. Prices rose by 0.7pc between December and January, making the average home worth £257,656. It comes despite the lender saying last month that it expects house prices to remain flat or decline by 0.2pc this year as mortgage rates moderate “only gradually” from the highs seen this year. Figures published by the Bank of England on Tuesday showed net mortgage approvals rose from 49,300 in November to 50,500 in December, while net approvals for remortgaging increased from 25,700 to 30,800. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said:  There have been some encouraging signs for potential buyers recently with mortgage rates continuing to trend down.  This follows a shift in view amongst investors around the future path of Bank Rate, with investors becoming more optimistic that the Bank of England will lower rates in the years ahead. While a rapid rebound in activity or house prices in 2024 appears unlikely, the outlook is looking a little more positive.  The most recent RICS survey suggests the decline in new buyer enquiries has halted, while there are tentative signs of a pickup in the number of properties coming onto the market. How mortgage rates evolve will be crucial, as affordability pressures were the key factor holding back housing market activity in 2023.  Indeed, at the end of 2023, a borrower earning the average UK income and buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20pc deposit had a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 38pc of take-home pay – well above the long run average of 30pc. If average mortgage rates were to trend down to 4pc, this would ease the mortgage payments burden to 34pc of take-home pay (assuming house prices and earnings are unchanged).  However, other things equal, mortgage rates of 3pc (still well above the lows seen in the wake of the pandemic) would be needed to bring this measure of affordability back towards its long run average.                      31 Jan 2024-07:09AM GMT                                         Good morning                    Thanks for joining me. House prices declined at their lowest rate in a year in the 12-months to January amid hopes that the Bank of England will start cutting interest rates soon. The Nationwide house price index showed that property values declined 0.2pc annually last month, having declined by 1.8pc across 2023.                      5 things to start your day                     1) Audit watchdog accuses HMRC of getting its sums wrong  | Incorrect forecasting leaves the Treasury facing billion-pound shortfalls 2) Cruise giant forced to change itinerary after Red Sea attacks  | Carnival reroutes 12 of its ships on around the world trips following months of disruption 3) How HSBC became the world’s most accident-prone bank  | Battered lender scrambles to draw a line under a litany of recent regulatory run-ins 4) Jeremy Warner: Markets are fatally complacent about the risks of World War Three  | The ‘great illusion’ that trade has made war less likely threatens to leave us perilously exposed 5) Ben Wright: Britain is in danger of throttling the university golden goose  | Viewing third level admissions through the lens of immigration carries risks                      What happened overnight                     Asian stocks mostly declined as markets awaited a decision on interest rates by the Federal Reserve, while China reported manufacturing contracted in January for a fourth straight month. Official data showed China’s manufacturing purchasing managers index, or PMI, rose to 49.2 in January, up from 49.0 in December, but still below the critical 50 mark that indicates expansion rather than contraction. Weak demand in the world’s second largest economy is dragging on growth. South Korea’s Kospi shed 0.2pc to 2,494.30 after Samsung Electronics reported reported an annual 34pc decline in operating profit for the last quarter. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dipped 1.1pc to 15,536.00, while the Shanghai Composite shed 0.4pc to 2,819.91. Tokyo stocks closed higher, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 index gaining 0.6pc, or 220.85 points, to 36,286.71, while the broader Topix index rose nearly 1pc, or 24.17 points, to 2,551.10. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 added 0.8pc to 7,657.20 after a survey showed Australia’s inflation rate fell to a two-year low in the December quarter, with the consumer price index at 4.1pc, leading to bets that the Reserve Bank may consider an interest rate cut in the next move. American indexes saw little change on Tuesday, at least outside the technology heavy Nasdaq.  The S&P 500 dropped 0.1pc, from its record to 4,924.97. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 leading US companies gained 0.3pc, reaching 38,467.31, while the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.8pc to 15,509.90. The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds, the centerpiece of the bond market, fell to 4.04pc from 4.09pc late on Monday. Load-Date: January 31, 2024  End of Document
