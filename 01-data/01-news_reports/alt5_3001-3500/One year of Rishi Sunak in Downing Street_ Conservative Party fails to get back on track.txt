   One year of Rishi Sunak in Downing Street: Conservative Party fails to get back on track CE Noticias Financieras English October 25, 2023 Wednesday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

Comparison, obviously, with two predecessors such as Boris Johnson or Liz Truss, against whom, despite all their faults and mistakes, Sunak comes out better. And tiredness, that of Conservative MPs who no longer have the desire or alternatives to rebel again and overthrow what would be their fourth leader in four years. "His mission was to introduce a certain degree of stability [in the country's economy, after the collapse of its credibility caused by Truss] and I think he has achieved it. In the prime minister's job he has shown credibility and ability, but now he needs to set out a vision for the future," demands John Hayes, a veteran Conservative MP who also chairs the Common Sense strand of the parliamentary group, a collection of at least fifty historically Eurosceptic Tory MPs, advocates of Brexit and far to the right in their approaches. "We need to know what the current purpose of the Conservative Party is, get a real sense of the direction we are going in, and be more conservative, not less," defends Hayes. Beyond his lurches, his opportunistic turns, his bad luck and, also, some of his successes during these months, Sunak's main problem is his inability -like that of the rest of his party colleagues- to reinvent himself after thirteen years in power. All the internal currents have tried their luck, without success: the social conservatism, with its doses of austerity, of David Cameron; the moderate line of Theresa May, forced to implement a Brexit in which she did not quite believe; the histrionic and, in the end, catastrophic populism of Boris Johnson; or the extreme neoliberalism of 'Thatcherite' cut of Liz Truss, which sank in a few days the pound sterling. Rishi Sunak was the salvation plank for some MPs who saw their seats and their salaries in danger, despite the fact that he was never liked by the members. The citizens approved his initial determination, and that of his finance minister, Jeremy Hunt, to straighten out the economy. His 'autumn budget', which involved more than 63 billion euros in new taxes and public spending cuts, left the most painful measures for the following year, and was applauded by the markets. But the new prime minister inherited a country with soaring inflation and a citizenry fed up with the cost-of-living crisis. Strikes by nurses and doctors, train and bus staff, letter carriers, teachers and even lawyers meant hundreds of thousands of working hours lost in a country that was already the slowest in the G-7 to recover its pre-pandemic economic level. The five promises With the technocratic mentality of his university education and his American experience in the world of finance, Sunak - the first politician of Indian origin to occupy Downing Street, although the country hardly celebrated that milestone - wanted to test his performance as Prime Minister against five concrete and measurable promises. On coming to power, he had announced a new government marked by "integrity, professionalism and accountability at all levels". At first it was enough to distance himself from Johnson and Truss, and to define his own personality by contrast, but it was not enough. Citizens wanted concrete results, and soon. These were her five commitments: to halve inflation; to get the British economy growing again; to lower public debt; to reduce waiting lists in the National Health Service (NHS) and, the most defining issue of her term in office, to put a stop to the arrival of small boats with irregular immigrants on the coasts of southern England. Some of them will be fulfilled on their own, more as a matter of luck or inertia than political commitment. Inflation, which during the first three months of Sunak's term was 10.7%, stood at 6.7% last September, and the Bank of England is confident that it will fall to 5% by the end of the year. The economy, it emerged a couple of months ago, had grown more than initially estimated and the government was able to dodge what was technically a recession. Debt, for the moment, remains unchanged. And NHS waiting lists have even worsened. The big fiasco of the Sunak government, however, has been its fierce fight against irregular immigration. A plan of deportations to Rwanda, branded illegal by the courts, never got off the ground. Giant boats, such as the Bibby Stockholm - 'floating prisons', according to its critics - that barely accommodate a thousand people, have suffered outbreaks of legionella and are the international shame of the United Kingdom. And a new Illegal Immigration Act (sic) that strips new arrivals of their right to claim asylum. "An indiscriminate strategy that is going to result in the expulsion of thousands of refugees. Last year, three quarters of the asylum requests were approved. In the future, all such people will be rejected outright," wrote Enver Solomon, the executive director of the UK Refugee Council. Foreign Policy 'successes Paradoxically for a politician who boasts of belonging to the first batch of those who defended the Brexit, it is likely that his most brilliant legacy - if finally the polls, expected at the latest in January 2025, dislodge him from Downing Street - will be made up of two rectifications in relations with Brussels. Sunak achieved peace in the bitter dispute regarding the Irish Protocol (the fit of this British region in the post-Brexit era) when he signed together with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von Der Leyen, the so-called Windsor Framework Agreement, last February. And he finally managed to reinstate the United Kingdom, just a month ago, to the Horizon Europe program for funding scientific projects. Brexit had been a tragedy for British researchers. His unconditional support for Ukraine, inherited from Johnson, and his absolute alignment with Israel in the recent war with Hamas have placed Sunak at the center of the geopolitical scene. But no one is a prophet in his own land, and as in all countries, successes abroad are a comfort and refuge for the head of government that are rarely applauded by his citizens. The turn to the extreme right With polls continuing to put the Labour opposition twenty points ahead, and by-elections - most recently last week's in the Mid Berdfordshire and Tamworth constituencies - in which Starmer's party has achieved historic victories and a dramatic swing in the direction of the vote, Sunak has taken the most desperate path. Alongside a hardening of anti-immigration rhetoric, a defense of 'family values' and a delay in his government's climate change commitments that borders on denialism, the prime minister attempted to present himself at the Conservative conference in Manchester a month ago as the 'candidate of change', ready to challenge the 'false consensus'. "By adopting the rhetoric of the far right, he has ended up reaping the same result: the widespread rejection of the country. Voters were very clear who Sunak was, so it has been unwise and confusing to try to convince them that he is someone different," laments former Conservative Education, and later Equalities, Minister Justine Greening. The most recent YouGov poll indicates that half of Britons rate Sunak's performance as prime minister as "poor or awful." Media outlets tracking internal unrest within the Conservative parliamentary group already count as many as twenty-five letters to the leadership from MPs who would like a change of leadership. But that figure is anonymous, and is only revealed when it reaches 15% of the deputies (about fifty), the level that triggers an internal censure motion like the one Margaret Thatcher or Theresa May suffered in their day. There seems to be no desire for heads to roll again. Some, the most rebellious, are already planning a new leadership of the party when, as it seems inevitable, it returns to the opposition. Most of them are simply observing Sunak and are solely responsible for the success or failure of the coming months.
