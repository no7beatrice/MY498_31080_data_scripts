   King's Speech: Tories 'not even pretending to govern anymore', claims Starmer telegraph.co.uk November 7, 2023 Tuesday 6:38 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 9223 words Byline: By Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor and Benedict Smith Body   Sir Keir Starmer claimed the Tories “are not even pretending to govern anymore” as he took aim at the contents of the King’s Speech.  The Labour leader claimed the Conservative Party had reached a “new low” and been reduced to the “desperate spectacle of claiming it offers change away from itself”.  He told the House of Commons: “Today’s address shows just how ridiculous that posturing is because what we have before us is a plan for more of the same, more sticking plasters, more division, more party first, country second gimmicks and no repudiation of the utterly discredited idea that economic growth is something the few hand down to the many.  “In fact today we reach something of a new low because they are not even pretending to govern anymore. They have given up on any sense of service. They see our country’s problems as something to be exploited, not solved.”  But Rishi Sunak defended his Government’s legislative plans for the new parliamentary session, arguing that he was taking “long-term decisions to build a brighter future for our country”.                      07 Nov 2023-06:38PM GMT                                         That's all for today                    Thank you for joining me for today’s politics live blog. Jack Maidment will be back tomorrow morning to guide you through the day’s developments.                      07 Nov 2023-06:29PM GMT                                         Government must fulfil manifesto pledge on animal trophies, says Villiers                    Theresa Villiers has said she is “disappointed” that the Government has not set out plans to ban the import of trophies hunted from endangered animals. The former environment secretary told the Commons: “This has strong support, the private member’s bill is blocked in the House of Lords, it’s a manifesto commitment.  “We must do this and I call on ministers to bring forward that bill.”                      07 Nov 2023-06:05PM GMT                                         Rees-Mogg 'disappointed' with migration plans                    Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg has argued that the Government needs to cut net migration after reports of a pro-Palestine march to go ahead on Armistice Day. Responding to the King’s Speech, the North East Somerset MP said integration is “not as deep as we thought it was”, adding that he was “disappointed” the Government was focusing on illegal migration. The way to maintain “good relations” between different communities, he continued, is to limit net migration. Sir Jacob echoed David Davis’ criticism of the proposal to let police search properties without a warrant, saying: “I don’t think the King’s Speech as a prelude to a manifesto is a place to water down our ancient liberties.”                      07 Nov 2023-05:52PM GMT                                         Be more 'aggressive' with Brexit freedoms, Rees-Mogg urges                    Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg has urged the Government to make better use of its Brexit freedoms by cutting red tape. The former Brexit opportunities minister said the Government should be more “aggressive” in its King’s Speech proposals, and prevent regulation being used “as a means of covert protectionism”. He added: “We have the chance to become a lowly, lightly, light-touch regulated economy that can be efficient and competitive.”                      07 Nov 2023-05:34PM GMT                                         Shadow minister: Conservative's economic record is 'abysmal'                    Shadow cabinet office minister Nia Griffith has claimed the “weak and empty” King’s Speech fails to show how the Government would create economic growth. She told an almost-deserted House of Commons: “Even if we were not expecting a great deal, the King’s Speech is even more disappointing than we could have imagined. “The Government says that it wants to create growth in the economy but there’s nothing in this speech to explain how. And the Government’s track record is abysmal. “Wages have stagnated whilst inflation has skyrocketed, leaving people struggling with a massive cost of living crisis.”                      07 Nov 2023-05:20PM GMT                                         Government sees Northern Ireland as 'third country', says DUP MP                    Sammy Wilson, the DUP MP, is “sad” that the Government believed it had to commit to safeguarding the union in the King’s Speech. Claiming Northern Ireland is now seen as a “third country” by the prime minister, he continued: “I’m sad that such a promise even had to be made. “It’s only necessary because successive prime ministers have played fast and loose with the union when it came to negotiations with the European Union. “Relations with the European Union were regarded as more important than relations within the United Kingdom.”                      07 Nov 2023-05:08PM GMT                                         Bring AI into classrooms for a 'winning King's speech', says Davis                    Mr Davis has now called on the Government to bring AI into the classrooms to improve social mobility and create a “winning King’s Speech”. He said: “When children go through their primary education, 35 per cent of then by the end of 11 are unable to cope with their Maths and English sufficiently to make progress in their other subjects. “For free school meal kids it’s 50pc-half of the children on free school meals have been failed by the state by the time they’re 11.” He argued that bring in AI could create “tailored” teaching for pupils who have fallen behind and boost their grades, claiming the technology already exists.                      07 Nov 2023-04:55PM GMT                                         David Davis: Removing warrant requirement is 'fundamental mistake'                    David Davis has argued the Government will make a “fundamental mistake” if it goes ahead with plans to let the police search properties without a court warrant. The former Brexit secretary, a long-standing campaigner for civil rights, said the move would take away a “fundamental foundation stone… of free British society”. He continued: “It’s there with jury trials and it’s there with the presumption of innocence.  “The right not to have the state kick your door down and come search your house with judicial approval is a massively important British value. The judicial control of the police is vital and must be preserved.”                      07 Nov 2023-04:42PM GMT                                         'Zombie government' has nothing to offer, says PAC chair                    The chair of the public accounts committee has labelled the King’s Speech “thin gruel” as she launched a stinging criticism of the Government’s record. Labour MP Meg Hillier took aim at a “zombie government” that offered “no hope” and “no plans”, and said a general election could not come quickly enough. She said: “This King’s Speech and this Prime Minister promised change, but we see nothing of that in what’s been announced. “No real hope here for renters or those who want to buy their own home and no plans to tackle poverty and really level up.”                      07 Nov 2023-04:30PM GMT                                         May 'concerned' at lack of modern slavery legislation                    Theresa May has criticised the lack of mental health and modern slavery legislation contained in the King’s Speech. The former prime minister told the Commons: “I’m very sorry that we have not seen amendments to the Modern Slavery Act brought forward in this gracious speech. “I’m also concerned about the lack of commitment to a new Mental Health Act… I believe it is important that we do this, it is something that many will want to see being done.” Mrs May also called on the Government to “press the accelerator” on moving to a “green economy”, but says she fears it is trying to “draw back”.                      07 Nov 2023-04:18PM GMT                                         Lib Dem leader: 'This is a Government that simply doesn't care'                    Ed Davey has taken aim at the Government’s plan for the annual award of new North Sea oil and gas drilling licences. The Lib Dem leader said: “Today the government could have brought forward plans to ensure Britain’s energy security, and bring down energy prices, sustainable energy price cuts for the long term.” Instead, he continued, “the Conservatives are choosing once again to shackle us to the expensive, dirty fossil fuels of the past… this is a government that simply doesn’t care.”                      07 Nov 2023-04:03PM GMT                                         Good afternoon                    Benedict Smith here, taking over from Jack Maidment to guide you through the latest developments as MPs debate the proposals put forward in the King’s Speech.                      07 Nov 2023-03:59PM GMT                                         SNP leader: 'Britain is broke and Brexit broke it'                    Stephen Flynn, the leader of the SNP in Westminster, said he had “heard the term economic growth used” during the King’s Speech debate.  He said: “That intrigued me because we all know that Britain is broke and Brexit broke it. But we so obviously need economic growth and for those of us on these benches there is an obvious solution on this front. There is perhaps three or four things that we could and should do.” Mr Flynn said the “easiest way” to boost the tax base was to “actually increase working age migration into these Isles” as he also argued for increased access to the EU single market.  He told the Commons: “I think we should be a bit more robust and confident about saying that not only do we need more migration on these Isles, we need access to that EU single market.”                      07 Nov 2023-03:52PM GMT                                         King's Speech 'builds on strong foundations', says Sunak                    Concluding his speech in the House of Commons, Rishi Sunak said: “This King’s Speech builds on the strong foundation of an economy well on its way to recovery. It rekjects big government and instead back s people and businesses to thrive.  “It strengthens society with historic measures to support the nation’s health and education. It secures our streets and borders with tougher sentences for criminals and powers for police and above all this King’s Speech delivers change.  “Change in our economy, change in our society, change in our comm8unities. It takes long-term decisions for a brighter future and I commend it to this House.”                      07 Nov 2023-03:42PM GMT                                         Sunak pokes fun at Starmer and Reeves                    Rishi Sunak poked fun at Sir Keir Starmer as he said: “Let me also thank the Leader of the Opposition for his contribution to this debate and indeed, his first U-turn of it.  “As a former republican he used to think this country shouldn’t even have a King’s Speech but at least that is one U-turn the whole country will welcome.” The Prime Minister described Labour’s plans for the economy as “dangerous, inflationary and the British people would pay the price in higher interest rates and taxes”.  Turning to Rachel Reeves, Mr Sunak said: “Labour will borrow anything. People’s money, people’s ideas and it now turns out that his copy and past chancellor is very happy to borrow other people’s work too.”                      07 Nov 2023-03:37PM GMT                                         King's Speech will mean 'more jobs, more investment, and higher growth', says PM                    Rishi Sunak said the King’s Speech will help to deliver “more jobs, more investment, and higher growth”.  The Prime Minister told MPs: “What will all this mean for the British people? More jobs, more investment, and higher growth. More police on the streets with stronger powers to keep us safe.  “Places people are proud to call home. A country strong at home, confident abroad and with a better future ahead for all our people. “That is the change that this King’s Speech and this Government will deliver.”                      07 Nov 2023-03:29PM GMT                                         Sunak: King's Speech about taking 'long-term decisions for brighter future'                    Rishi Sunak is now on his feet in the House of Commons.  Depending the King’s Speech after attacks from Sir Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister said: “This King’s Speech is about what this Government is about, taking long term decisions to build a brighter future for our country.  “It builds on foundations that were far stronger than they were just a year ago.  “Inflation falling and on track to be halved. An economy now growing faster than France and Germany. National debt on track to fall. More support for the NHS this winter. And we are stopping the boats with crossings this year down by over a fifth.”                       07 Nov 2023-03:23PM GMT                                         'Only fight left in them is the fight for their own skin'                    Turning to the economy, Sir Keir Starmer said: “What we got instead is an exercise in economic miserabilism. An admission that his Government has no faith in Britain’s ability to avert decline.”  The Labour leader labelled the Government’s plan for the annual award of new North Sea oil and gas drilling licences a “gimmick”.  He concluded his speech by accusing the Tories of a “failure to seize the opportunities” in front of them and claimed that the “only fight left in them is the fight for their own skin”.                      07 Nov 2023-03:19PM GMT                                         Starmer criticises Braverman over rough sleeping comments                     Sir Keir Starmer took aim at Suella Braverman over her recent comments about rough sleeping being a “lifestyle choice”  for some people.  Some Labour MPs shouted “sack her” as Sir Keir told Rishi Sunak: “Without a serious home secretary there can be no serious government and he cannot be a serious prime minister. Homelessness is a choice, it is a political choice.”  The Home Secretary was sat next to Mr Sunak on the Government frontbench when Sir Keir made the remarks.                       07 Nov 2023-03:16PM GMT                                         Tory claims of change are 'laughable', says Starmer                    Sir Keir Starmer said that the “biggest question is how they [the Conservatives] think this is anywhere near good enough after all the chaos they have unleashed”. He said: “This is the plan they put to the working people of this country and say ‘trust us, we have changed’. It is laughable.”                      07 Nov 2023-03:13PM GMT                                         Sir Keir Starmer claims Tories have hit a 'new low'                    Sir Keir Starmer is now on his feet in the House of Commons to deliver his response to the King’s Speech.  The Labour leader said recent Labour by-election victories had demonstrated that “Britain is ready for change”.  He said the Tories had been reduced to the “desperate spectacle of claiming it offers change away from itself”.  He told the House of Commons: “Today’s address shows just how ridiculous that posturing is because what we have before us is a plan for more of the same, more sticking plasters, more division, more party first, country second gimmicks and no repudiation of the utterly discredited idea that economic growth is something the few hand down to the many.  “In fact today we reach something of a new low because they are not even pretending to govern anymore. They have given up on any sense of service. They see our country’s problems as something to be exploited, not solved.”                       07 Nov 2023-02:59PM GMT                                         Conservative MP jokes about Labour 'backstabbing'                     Siobhan Baillie, the Tory MP for Stroud, said she had told her non-political family that she had been chosen to speak second in the King’s Speech debate today.  She said her family had replied “oh, great, that’s a really good film”, prompting laughter on both sides of the chamber. Ms Baillie said she was often asked how she dealt with all of the “backstabbing” in Westminster and she joked that she replied “I don’t hang around with the Labour Party”.  After laughter among the Tories and jeers from the opposition, Ms Baillie said: “What I actually say is that to survive in this place you have to find some friends and then fully expect them to push you in the Thames in the run up to a reshuffle.”                       07 Nov 2023-02:52PM GMT                                         Tory backbencher reveals difference between MPs and supermarket trolleys                     Sir Robert Goodwill revealed he had once been unfavourably compared to a supermarket trolley.  The Conservative MP for Scarborough and Whitby told the Commons: “Having been here a while I can now reveal the real answer to the question.  “The difference between an MP and a supermarket trolley is that there is a physical limit to the amount of food and drink you can get into a supermarket trolley.”                       07 Nov 2023-02:49PM GMT                                         Veteran Tory MP pokes fun at Liz Truss                     Sir Robert Goodwill prompted laughter in the House of Commons as he poked fun at Liz Truss and the length of her premiership.  The veteran Tory MP told the Commons: “We have now had three women Conservative premiers, assuming the most recent one counts of course.”                      07 Nov 2023-02:46PM GMT                                         'Don’t count your chickens on the basis of by-election results'                    Veteran Tory MP Sir Robert Goodwill said that he was the “warm up act” for Tory rising star Siobhan Baillie.  “I was the future once,” he joked, prompting laughter on both sides of the chamber.  Sir Robert, who represents the constituency of Scarborough and Whitby, said that we “seem to be having a lot of by-elections at the moment”, prompting laughter and shouts of “more” from the opposition benches.  Recounting how seats are won and lost, Sir Robert said the lesson was “don’t count your chickens on the basis of by-election results”.                      07 Nov 2023-02:40PM GMT                                         Debate on King's Speech gets underway in Commons                     The debate on the King’s Speech is now underway in the House of Commons.  The “mover” of the debate is Sir Robert Goodwill, a veteran Tory MP and former minister, who will speak first. The “seconder” of the debate will be Siobhan Baillie, a Tory MP who was first elected in 2019, who will speak second.                       07 Nov 2023-02:22PM GMT                                         Cabinet minister rejects suggestion King's Speech points to May election                     David TC Davies, the Welsh Secretary, rejected the suggestion that the number of bills in the King’s Speech could point to a general election happening in May rather than later next year.  The relative brevity of the King’s Speech-it contains 21 bills-has prompted speculation in Westminster that Rishi Sunak could call an election sooner rather than later next year.  But Cabinet minister Mr Davies said he believed the legislation would take “the next year” to get through Parliament.  Asked about the prospect of a May election, Mr Davies told Sky News: “Well, there are, as you say, over 20 bills in this and there is going to be a lot of hard work over the next year I think for members of Parliament to get them through.  “I have got absolutely no idea when the next election is coming, I really don’t mind, I am looking forward to whenever it does come.”                       07 Nov 2023-02:16PM GMT                                         Poll: Labour lead over Tories falls to 16 points                     Labour’s lead over the Tories has shrunk slightly to 16 points, according to a new Savanta survey.  A new poll conducted between November 3-5 puts Labour on 45 per cent of the vote and the Tories on 29 per cent.  The Tories were unchanged when compared to the company’s previous poll conducted between October 27-29 but Labour were down by one point.

Speaking to Sky News, the shadow home secretary said: “Overall I think this is really thin. At a time when the country has just felt so chaotic, so many things feel broken, I think people are crying out for change.  “What this King’s Speech showed was that Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives are incapable of delivering the change the country needs.  “No serious plan on growth, no serious plan on the cost-of-living crisis, no serious plan to cut waiting lists in the NHS or tackle the crisis in the NHS and no serious plan to get police back on the beat or tackle things like the epidemic of shoplifting where they could have brought in law reforms that would have helped on things like that.”                       07 Nov 2023-01:45PM GMT                                         Sir Ed Davey: King's Speech showed Tories are 'tired'                    Sir Ed Davey claimed the King’s Speech had shown the Tories were “tired” and had “run out of ideas”.  The leader of the Liberal Democrats told Sky News: “I was really a bit surprised actually. It was really tired. This was not a vision. This is a Government that clearly has run out of ideas, almost admitting it.  “Frankly the sooner they are put out of their misery and we have a general election the better.”                      07 Nov 2023-01:31PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer deliver verdicts on King's Speech from 2.30pm                    Rishi Sunak will set out the reasoning behind his King’s Speech in the House of Commons later this afternoon.  The Commons will start debating the address from 2.30pm and Mr Sunak will have his say before Sir Keir Starmer then delivers his verdict.  But before the two leaders speak, tradition dictates that two backbench MPs-one a veteran of the Commons and the other a newcomer-will open the debate with what are supposed to be funny speeches.                       07 Nov 2023-12:58PM GMT                                         Longest monarch's speech at State Opening since 2005                    The King’s Speech ran to 1,223 words-making it the longest monarch’s speech at a State Opening of Parliament since 2005. It was 349 words longer than the speech at the previous state opening in May 2022, which was delivered by Charles – then Prince of Wales – on behalf of his mother, the late Queen, who did not attend on doctors’ advice. The text of this year’s speech took 11 and a half minutes for Charles to read out loud, compared with eight minutes and 45 seconds last year. It was the longest text, by word count, since the 1,248-word speech delivered by the late Queen at the 2005 state opening of Parliament, which followed the third successive general election victory for the Labour Party led by Tony Blair.                      07 Nov 2023-12:45PM GMT                                         Sunak: 'We have put our country on a better path'                     Rishi Sunak said the Government had “put our country on a better path” as he hailed today’s King’s Speech.  The Prime Minister said in a video posted on Twitter: “One year ago I stood on the steps of Downing Street and promised to deliver for the people of this country. Today the results are clear.  “Inflation is down, easing the burden of the cost of living. The economy is growing and debt is falling. There is more to do on cutting NHS waiting lists, but we’ve made progress cutting the longest waits for NHS treatment and we are stopping the boats.  “Some said it couldn’t be done but this year migrants coming illegally by boat are down by over a fifth. We have put our country on a better path.  “But I am far more ambitious for what we can achieve.

The grand ceremonial event saw a return to the full pomp and pageantry of old, with Charles, 74, donning the heavy Imperial State Crown and the Queen re-wearing her Coronation gown, accessorised with the glittering George IV State Diadem. Their Majesties arrived at the Houses of Parliament in a grand carriage procession featuring a string of ornate state coaches and some 1,400 members of the armed forces.

Loud boos rang out from hundreds of Republic activists as they chanted “not my king” and “down with the crown” as the monarch made his way through Parliament Square in Westminster. The group claimed that around 200 protesters were lining the route of his procession, with pictures showing a sea of yellow banners reading “not my king”.  But as the King travelled in the royal carriage, he was filmed waving to the protesters lining the route.

The leader of the Liberal Democrats said: “The country is crying out for change and hope for a brighter future, instead all Rishi Sunak had to offer was cheap gimmicks and reheated policies.  “There was nothing but empty words on the biggest issues facing the country, from the NHS crisis to the sewage scandal. There were no real solutions for patients left waiting months in pain for treatment, homeowners seeing their mortgages sky-rocket or communities seeing their local rivers ruined by sewage. “It shows the Conservative government is out of touch, out of ideas and deserves to be kicked out of office.”                      07 Nov 2023-12:07PM GMT                                         King's Speech contains 21 bills-fewest since 2014                     The King’s Speech contains 21 bills in total.

The monarch said: “My ministers will work closely with international partners to support Ukraine, strengthen Nato and address the most pressing security challenges.  “This includes the consequences of the barbaric acts of terrorism against the people of Israel, facilitating humanitarian support into Gaza and supporting the cause of peace and stability in the Middle East.”                      07 Nov 2023-11:43AM GMT                                         Security services to be given ‘powers they need’                    The security services will be given the “powers they need” to address the changing national security picture.  The King told the House of Lords: “At a time when threats to national security are changing rapidly due to new technology, my ministers will give the security and intelligence services the powers they need and will strengthen independent judicial oversight.”                      07 Nov 2023-11:43AM GMT                                         Ministers to take action to ‘prevent new or complex crimes’                    Laws will be introduced by the Government to stop “new or complex crimes”, the King has announced.

The King said: “My Government is committed to tackling anti-Semitism and ensuring that the Holocaust is never forgotten. A bill will progress the construction of a national Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre in Victoria Tower Gardens.”                      07 Nov 2023-11:41AM GMT                                         Sunak pledges crackdown on ‘punitive service charges’ faced by homeowners                    The Government will introduce a law to tackle “punitive service charges” faced by many homeowners.

The King said: “My Government will introduce legislation to create a smokefree generation by restricting the sale of tobacco so that children currently aged 14 or younger can never be sold cigarettes, and restricting the sale and marketing of e-cigarettes to children.”                      07 Nov 2023-11:39AM GMT                                         Sunak vows to take advantage of ‘Brexit freedoms’ to boost trade                    The King told the House of Lords: “My ministers will take steps to make the economy more competitive, taking advantage of freedoms afforded by the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union.  “A bill will be brought forward to promote trade and investment with economies in the fastest growing region in the world. “My ministers will continue to negotiate trade agreements with dynamic economies, delivering jobs and growth in the United Kingdom.”                      07 Nov 2023-11:38AM GMT                                         ‘Ministers will strengthen education for the long term’                    The Government’s education reforms will “strengthen education for the long term”, the King said as he delivered his address in the House of Lords.

Addressing the House of Lords, he said: “Legislation will be introduced to strengthen the United Kingdom’s energy security, and reduce reliance on volatile international energy markets and hostile foreign regimes.  “This Bill will support the future licensing of new oil and gas fields, helping the country to transition to net zero by 2050 without adding undue burdens on households.”                      07 Nov 2023-11:36AM GMT                                         ‘My Government will continue to take action to bring down inflation’                     Rishi Sunak’s Government will continue to tackle inflation and support the Bank of England by taking “responsible decisions on spending and borrowing”, the King said.

King Charles III said the Government will make the “difficult but necessary long-term decisions to change this country for the better”.

MPs will be “invited” to attend by Black Rod who will walk from the Lords to the Commons and bang on the door to ask them to join proceedings.                      07 Nov 2023-11:17AM GMT                                         King Charles and Queen Camilla arrive at Parliament                    King Charles and Queen Camilla have just arrived at the Palace of Westminster for the State Opening of Parliament.  The King entered Parliament through the Sovereign’s Entrance and will shortly deliver his first King’s Speech.                       07 Nov 2023-11:14AM GMT                                         Pictured: Imperial State Crown arrives at the Sovereign's Entrance at Parliament                                         07 Nov 2023-11:09AM GMT                                         King Charles expected to pay tribute to his mother                     For the first time in four years, the House of Lords chamber is packed with 600 guests, ready to listen to the first King’s Speech in more than 70 years.  The King is expected to pay tribute to his mother when he delivers his speech, following a precedent set by his predecessors. When Elizabeth II gave her first state opening speech on November 4, 1952, she paid tribute to her father’s “selfless devotion to his duties” and the example he set. She said it would be her “constant endeavour to follow” that standard. George V, who delivered his first state opening speech on February 6, 1911, said: “In opening the first Parliament elected in my reign, the grievous loss which the Empire has sustained by the death of my beloved father is upper most in my thoughts.”                      07 Nov 2023-11:07AM GMT                                         Diamond Jubilee State Coach celebrates hundreds of years of UK history                     The Diamond Jubilee State Coach is the most recent addition to the Royal Mews, writes Victoria Ward.  Built in Australia and first used in 2014, the three-ton,18-ft long coach boasts hydraulic suspension, a heating system, lighting, electric windows and air conditioning. It was originally intended to mark the late Queen’s 80th birthday in 2006 but took so long to build, it was named instead in honour of the 60th anniversary of her accession in 2012.  The coach celebrates hundreds of years of British history. Pieces of Henry VIII’s warship the Mary Rose, Sir Issac Newton’s apple tree and the stone of destiny are some of the many artefacts incorporated into the bodywork of the carriage.                       07 Nov 2023-11:05AM GMT                                         King Charles wears Admiral of the Fleet Royal Naval dress uniform on journey to Parliament                    The King is wearing his Admiral of the Fleet Royal Naval dress uniform, with cap and sword, Victoria Ward reports.  The Queen is wearing her Coronation dress, designed by Bruce Oldfield and the Princess Royal is wearing the uniform of the Colonel of The Blues and Royals.  On arrival at the Houses of Parliament, the King will put on the Imperial State Crown and Robe of State. The Queen will don the George IV State Diadem and Robe of State.  The late Queen wore the £6million diadem for her coronation in 1953 and every state opening since. With more than 1,300 diamonds, the diadem, a familiar sight from stamps and coins, was made for George IV in 1820. His Majesty was promoted in 2012 to the five-star rank of Admiral of the Fleet, Field Marshal and Marshal of the Royal Air Force by his late mother.                      07 Nov 2023-11:02AM GMT                                         MP and government whip held 'captive' at Buckingham Palace                     As per tradition, the Vice-Chamberlain of the Household-an MP and government whip-will be held “captive” at Buckingham Palace during the state opening to guarantee the monarch’s safe return, Victoria Ward, our Royal Editor, reports. This year’s hostage is Jo Churchill, MP for Bury St. Edmunds, who will arrive and depart from Buckingham Palace independently.  It is unclear when this custom began, although according to a House of Commons library briefing paper, it may only date back to the 1960s or 1970s.  Since at least 1837, however, the Vice Chamberlain has remained at the Palace during the State Opening. While “captive”, they are offered an alcoholic drink by the Lord Chamberlain as they watch the State Opening on television.                      07 Nov 2023-11:00AM GMT                                         King Charles and Queen Camilla depart Buckingham Palace                    The Sovereign’s Carriage Procession, with two outriders on grey horses, left the grand entrance of Buckingham Palace at 11am and is due to arrive at the sovereign’s entrance at the House of Lords at 11.15am. The King and Queen are travelling in the Diamond Jubilee State Coach, last seen in action when they made their way to their Coronation at Westminster Abbey on May 6. Their Majesties are followed, in the Glass Coach, by two Queen’s Companions, Fiona Mary Petty-Fitzmaurice, the Marchioness of Lansdowne and Lady Sarah Keswick, alongside Master of the Horse, Lord de Mauley, and Earl of Rosslyn, The Lord Steward. The Princess Royal, Gold Stick in Waiting, travelled behind in a state landau with brigadier Mark Berry, silver stick in waiting, and Colonel Guy Stone, Field Officer in Brigade Waiting In the next state landau are Baroness Swinburn, Baroness-in-waiting, Marcus Jones, Treasurer of the Household and Rebecca Harris, Comptroller of the Household. The third state landau is carrying Sir Clive Alderton, the King’s principal private secretary, Sir Michael Stevens, Field Officer in Brigade Waiting and Sophie Densham, the Queen’s private secretary. In a motor vehicle bringing up the rear of the Sovereign’s Carriage Procession is Col Toby Browne, the crown equerry, followed by the Household Cavalry providing the Sovereign’s Escort.                      07 Nov 2023-10:55AM GMT                                         Princess Royal to act as 'Gold Stick In Waiting'                    The Princess Royal was personally asked by the King to take on the role of his “protector” during the first state opening of parliament of his reign, writes Victoria Ward. Charles, 74, has asked his sister to ride in the procession as Gold Stick In Waiting, a key role historically handed to a person entrusted with the personal safety of the monarch.  Princess Anne, 73, carried out the same role during the Coronation in May, riding on horseback from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace. She will travel in a state landau behind the King and Queen, as the grand procession makes its way to the Houses of Parliament. She will then enter the chamber alongside the King, the first time she is thought to have accompanied the monarch since 1985, when she joined her late mother, Elizabeth II.                      07 Nov 2023-10:46AM GMT                                         Regalia Procession now underway                     Two state carriages, accompanied by two outriders on bay horses, form the first grand procession from Buckingham Palace to the Houses of Parliament, writes Victoria Ward. The Regalia Procession left Buckingham Palace shortly after 10.30am. This is led by Queen Alexandra’s State Coach, with four bay horses, carrying the royal regalia-the Imperial State Crown, the Cap of Maintenance and the Sword of State. Behind that will come the King Edward VII Town Coach, with two bay horses, carrying Richard Thompson and David Turner, Serjeants-at-Arms. The coach is followed by a vehicle carrying Mark Appleby, the crown jeweller, and Alexander Scully, the deputy comptroller.                      07 Nov 2023-10:44AM GMT                                         House of Lords packed ahead of arrival of the King                     The House of Lords is now packed to the rafters ahead of the arrival of King Charles III.

They will then travel the short journey to the Palace of Westminster before arriving at the Sovereign’s Entrance at the House of Lords.  The King will then deliver the King’s Speech in the Lords at 11.25am.                       07 Nov 2023-10:20AM GMT                                         Sunak leaves No10 ahead of King's Speech                    Rishi Sunak has just left 10 Downing Street.

The Telegraph has pulled together a piece identifying the key bills-and how they will affect you-and you can find it here.                        07 Nov 2023-10:05AM GMT                                         Pictured: Anti-monarchy group Republic protest outside Parliament ahead of King's Speech                                         07 Nov 2023-10:00AM GMT                                         Pictured: Yeoman of the Guard arrive at Parliament ahead of State Opening                                          07 Nov 2023-09:51AM GMT                                         Princess Anne will protect King during his first State Opening of Parliament                    The Princess Royal will take on the ceremonial role of the King’s “protector” during the first state opening of Parliament  of his reign. Charles, 74, has asked his sister to ride in the procession as Gold Stick In Waiting, a key role historically handed to a person entrusted with the personal safety of the monarch. Princess Anne, 73, carried out the same role during the Coronation in May , riding on horseback from Westminster Abbey to Buckingham Palace.

Labour’s national campaign coordinator told Sky News: “I understand why people have strong feelings about it – look at what we’re seeing on the news every night. People want to say, ‘make it stop’, and they want politicians to just say, ‘make it stop’. “The point I’m making this morning is yes, we do want to make it stop, but our ambitions should be more than just a ceasefire – it should be a more secure future for both Israelis and Palestinians. “There will always be a debate about these things in our party, but the party’s position was set out by the leader last week and that’s not going to change.”                      07 Nov 2023-09:19AM GMT                                         'We think that it’s wise advice'                     Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said that the Metropolitan Police advice to the organisers of Saturday’s pro-Palestinian march was “wise” and should be followed. “It’s a matter for the police and the police came out yesterday and they, of course, have to weigh up a number of competing considerations,” he said. “Of course, there is the right to protest, which is important, but also concerns about public safety. Now, they have been very clear that having weighed all that up, their strong request is that these marches don’t take place and we support the police in that. “We think that it’s wise advice. We think it takes account of all the competing considerations and that it should be followed.”                      07 Nov 2023-08:52AM GMT                                         Chalk urges pro-Palestinian protesters to call off Armistice Day march                    Alex Chalk has urged pro-Palestinian protesters to listen to the Metropolitan Police and call off a march planned for Armistice Day.  The Justice Secretary said it was a “really sacred day in our annual calendar” and the organisers of the march should give the Met’s recommendation to call off the rally the “greatest possible weight”.  Asked if he was worried about the potential for violence to stem from the march, Mr Chalk told Times Radio: “Yes, I am. Of course there are these competing interests in a fair society but there is no doubt that this one time of the year when we come together to remember our war dead, the people who have paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms is a really sacred day in our annual calendar.  “And critically the police have weighed all this up and they have made a decision about not only what is in the wider public interest but bluntly what measures need to be taken to avoid the risk of violence as you indicated just now.  “I think those recommendations should be adhered to. I think the organisers should give the greatest possible weight to that recommendation from the police and I think they should abide by it.”                       07 Nov 2023-08:36AM GMT                                         Farage labels Government and Met ‘gutless’ over failure to stop march                    Nigel Farage accused the Government and the Metropolitan Police of being “gutless” over their failure to ban a pro-Palestinian march planned for Armistice Day.  The Met have asked the organisers of the march to reconsider and call it off but they have insisted they will press ahead. Mr Farage, the former leader of the Brexit Party, told GB News: “Of course, Suella [Braverman] is very good at denouncing these marches as ‘hate marches’.  “But given we have the Public Order Act; it is not beyond the wit of man for the police and the government to actually show some courage and some leadership and to do what most of us think is the right and appropriate thing.  “And yet, I’m afraid, we’re led by gutless people who are not prepared to do this and who allow events to overtake us. “Maybe that’ll change between now and the end of the week, but right now, it is as if the police are saying to the government, ‘you decide’ and the government is saying to the police, ‘you decide’.”                      07 Nov 2023-08:28AM GMT                                         Pictured: Shapps and Cleverly hold talks with counterparts in Tokyo                                         07 Nov 2023-08:18AM GMT                                         King's Speech measures not driven by proximity of general election, insists Chalk                    Justice Secretary Alex Chalk rejected the suggestion that the measures in the King’s Speech today were focused on a general election, expected next year. He told LBC Radio: “I would respectfully disagree. You’re right, there is a general election in the air, that’s correct. “A lot of the things that we are doing are things that we have been thinking about for some time. So I myself personally, when I wasn’t in government last year, I was speaking at the Conservative Party conference, and a lot of what we’re going to do, they’re the very measures that I was talking about then. “These are things that people like me and others have been thinking about, have been working out, have been doing the intellectual groundwork on and we’re now going to bring them into force.”                      07 Nov 2023-08:13AM GMT                                         King Charles III to deliver his first King's Speech at 11.25am                    King Charles III will set out Rishi Sunak’s legislative plans for the new parliamentary session in an address to the House of Lords at 11.25am.  It will be his first address as monarch. The speech will then be debated in the House of Commons after lunch, starting just after 2.30pm, when we will hear from both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer. There will be a total of five days of debate on the address, with proceedings in the Commons returning to normal next Tuesday.                       07 Nov 2023-08:08AM GMT                                         Chalk: Criminal justice reforms about ‘head as well as heart’                    Alex Chalk said criminal justice reforms due to be set out at the King’s Speech this morning are about “head as well as heart”. The Justice Secretary told Times Radio: “This is about head as well as it is about heart. This is about ensuring that, I don’t want you, I don’t want your family, I don’t want my family, to be victims of crime. “So what I want to ensure is that people who are the greatest threat to you and your family are kept out of circulation for longer… but those who are capable of being rehabilitated should be rehabilitated. And that seems to me to be smart.” Criminal justice reforms are expected to be the centrepiece of today’s King’s Speech as the State Opening of Parliament takes place.
