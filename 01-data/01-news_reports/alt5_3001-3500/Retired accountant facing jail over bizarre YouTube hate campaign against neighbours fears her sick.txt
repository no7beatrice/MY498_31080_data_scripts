   Retired accountant facing jail over bizarre YouTube hate campaign against neighbours fears her sick dog will die alone if she's sent to prison and insists she is the victim in rows sparked by parking, litter, Brexit and her pet turkeys MailOnline September 26, 2023 Tuesday 8:10 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:3 Length: 1734 words Byline: Andrew Chamberlain Body   A retired accountant facing jail over a bizarre YouTube hate campaign against her neighbours sparked by parking, litter, Brexit and her ownership of loud clucking turkeys says she is terrified of being sent to prison - because her sick dog will die alone. Noelle Obcarskas said it was 'a travesty of justice' that she was found guilty of harassment in her absence, and she should have been allowed to fight to clear her name. The 64-year-old, who claimed she could not attend court because she had covid, has now vowed to appeal any sentence given. Obcarskas insists that she is the victim of a hate campaign, which began after the UK voted for Brexit in 2016. She said her car had been vandalised, flowers and plants ripped up from her gardens and rubbish dumped on her drive. Obcarskas, who walks with a stick, said she became enraged when she contacted the police after discovering a neighbour had been leaving rubbish behind her car - only for the cops to back the culprit. She said it was then she posted the videos. Obcarskas - sitting under an umbrella in her garden where she has lived for more than 30 years - said: 'I am the one who has been persecuted. My car is left-hand drive and after Brexit, people kept leaving stickers on my car saying 'f*ck off back to Lithuania' and I was shouted at in the street. 'These were my neighbours, who I had previously got on well with. It was only a couple of them, who shouted at me. 'I began to keep my distance from them after discovering that they were Brexiteers. That's when the trouble started and they began being nasty to me and my car wing mirror was damaged. 'Another time I was woken at midnight by my neighbours banging on my door, accusing me of moving my gnome into their garden. 'They were screaming that they were going to sort me out. It was two years later that they discovered who had moved it. Someone had done it as a prank. Why would I have moved it? 'That was terrible and I was scared. I reported it to the police as I was very upset.' Obcarskas claimed the incidents continued. She said: 'For weeks and weeks, rubbish kept being put behind the wheel of my car. I just moved it to the side and didn't say anything because it was petty. Then it escalated and I found it on my path. 'One day I came out of the house, and I saw him throwing it in the garden. He said he was going to continue doing it, so I called the police and sent them the video of him doing it. 'Two police officers came round and, this is why I got angry, and posted the comments on the video. 'They went to his house, picked up the rubbish and disposed it for him. 'She (the police officer) said she was taking it away for the 'gentleman'. She called him a gentleman and took away this fly-tipper's rubbish. 'Is that what we pay our taxes for? I was furious and that's why I wrote the comments on the video. 'The next thing I know they police charge me with harassment. He has been harassing me for weeks.' Obcarskas said the day before the trial, she tested positive for covid.

It is not fair that I didn't have a chance to represent myself. 'It is also outrageous that people don't recognise that I was too ill to go to court and didn't want to put people at risk.' She added: 'I'm frightened to go to jail because of my dog. He is dying. 'I will have no one to look after him and he will die alone. 'Of course, I'm frightened for myself and don't want to go to jail but my dog needs me. 'I don't know the sentencing date but I will be appealing the sentence.' Obcarskas, of Pulford, Chester, posted a series of bizarre films online of her having explosive rows. Chester Magistrates' Court heard one was over her turkeys, which she denies. 'I don't understand why turkeys were mentioned. I have not owned turkeys for over five years, and nobody complained. Everybody loved them.' Neighbours called in police after complaints about the smell and loud gobbling noises made by the turkeys - one of which is called Tom. They also claimed Obcarskas hurled abuse at them in the cul-de sac, near where the Duke of Westminster has his family seat. In one video Obcarskas called company director John McKimmie, 40, a 'little fat bully with a skivvy wife' as he remonstrated with her for deliberately blocking his driveway with large pieces of foam. She also posted a message on a Facebook community page about the father of two saying: 'Words cannot and are inadequate to describe this display of total t***. No wonder his kids are tongue tied and speechless in his presence when he repeatedly tells them to say something.' In her campaign vegan Obcarskas targeted 73-year-old Gareth Lloyd who complained about the smell of the turkeys. She called him and Mr McKimmie 't***s', 'd***heads', and 'c***s' and added: 'They have left their irrelevant a*** wiping skivvy fishwives out of having anything to say being mere females... In their ego little d*** minds, they are not even ladies.' In another of her videos Obcarskas filmed herself goading Mr Lloyd outside his home which she posted on YouTube. During the verbal exchange a clearly frustrated Mr Lloyd who was filming Obcarskas on his iPad to get evidence for police was heard telling her: 'You are one obnoxious evil woman' and adding: 'You're top of the class when it comes to stupid. If you're on these videos, it would be X-rated... because of your looks.' In the same film, Obcarskas who has also has two 'vegan dogs' and a 'vegan cat' panned her camera to a third neighbouring property as a woman screamed: 'You're a 100% hypocrite!' at her from her bedroom window. In a different video she filmed herself having a slanging match with the same neighbour over the parking of her Renault people carrier outside their adjoining homes. University educated Obcarskas - whose partner currently lives in Germany - claimed she was being targeted due to her Lithuanian heritage and in social media posts called her neighbours 'lying Brexiteers with possible pre senile dementia'. She also slurred them on a Facebook group she created called: 'Pulford Chester England Near Wales Cymru pronounced Kumree.' JPs found her guilty of harassment between March and May last year after a trial which she failed to attend. A warrant was issued for her arrest and she now faces up to 12 weeks in jail under sentencing guidelines. Last year she was fined £180 for threatening behaviour following a similar incident in 2021. Obcraskas, who has lives in her £180,000 home dubbed Cluckingham Palace, frequently abused her neighbours. Mr McKimmie, who works for a US-based firm engaged in hydrocarbon exploration moved into the cul-de-sac ten years ago and told the court: 'We have different views on the world and life in general but we used to have meaningful conversations and that started to break down slowly. 'In 2021, she started to get a bit erratic, swearing in the street and it started to distress the family. 'We assisted Cheshire Police in gathering evidence and the relationship has certainly broken down a lot since then and I feel a bit more targeted. In April of last year, one day I was taking the kids to school and when I returned there was two lots of foam, quite a fair size, blocking the driveway so I moved them to the side and then went into the house and looked out the window. 'I saw Noelle taking the foam and she blocked the driveway again and I went outside and passed it back to her. I asked her if she minded not littering but as soon as I approached her, she had the camera started and targeted abuse. She called my wife a 'skivvy', that sort of thing. 'It made me a little bit upset at the time, getting abused in the street. On one occasion she was yelling, 'I wish you were dead' from her property. 'Normal tasks like making breakfast for the kids, taking them to school is all part of a wholesome family life, but what she does undoes it all. I should not be dealing with abuse and people blocking the driveway.' Mr McKimmie was shown screenshots of messages Obcarskas had posted to Facebook - one saying: 'Little d***s like this need to bully to compensate for their short fat stature.' When asked who he thought Obcarskas was referring to, he replied: 'I guess that's myself' and added. 'One of the neighbours messaged me to say 'You may want to check Facebook. Some comments were made about you'. I felt a little defamed in the public eye. Those were uploaded to a village notice board for all to see. 'It did raise some questions. I am quite well known in the community, helping out with fairs in the park.' Mr Lloyd, himself an accountant who has lived in the close for more than 20 years told the hearing the pair fell out five years ago and said: 'The relationship at one time with Noelle was good. In fact she has been in our house and has been in our garden. 'But I am aware of the insults that she has put on social media, and the way I have heard her speaking to John, and things that she has said about John and his wife and the children.' Emily Land, counsel for the prosecution, said: 'the parties concerned do not generally get along and there have been issues in the past. It appears to Mr McKimmie that the defendant is fixated with him. 'The defendant admitted in an interview that this was her YouTube channel and Facebook page the comments that she made but suggested her actions were justified because of provocation from her neighbours. She did not consider that she had caused any harassment, alarm or distress.' In convicting Obcarskas JP Mark Turner said: 'We accept that evidence of both Mr John McKimmie and Mr Gareth Lloyd who were both credible in their evidence. We find that Miss Obcarskas did cause harassment, alarm and distress by posting defamatory comments on various platforms.' After the case Mr McKimmie, who works for a US firm engaged in hydrocarbon exploration, said: 'I am happy with the result and that justice is being served - it is good for the family and good for me. I am just hoping that's the end of the matter. I hope there is no re-occurrence of the harassment. I hope that Noelle gets what she needs out of it, the correct help.'
