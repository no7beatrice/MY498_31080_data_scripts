   Starmer is ‘heir to Blair’ after wins in Mid Bedfordshire and Tamworth — as it happened thetimes.co.uk October 19, 2023 Thursday 9:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:45 Length: 5685 words Byline: Chris Smyth | Geraldine Scott | Steven Swinford | Will Humphries | Peter Chappell | Joshua Thurston | Graphics by Anna Lombardi and Yennah Smart Highlight: Labour leader points to former PM’s three victories after ‘game-changing’ by-election victories Body   Sir Keir Starmer has positioned himself as the heir to Tony Blair as he claimed that his party’s double by-election victory reflected “the mood of the country”. The Labour leader said that Conservative voters were turning to Labour because they were “fed up with the decline and despairing of the party they used to vote for”. His party has taken two previously safe Tory seats in what Labour has hailed as a “political earthquake”, with swings of more than 20 per cent. This would put Starmer on course for a Blair-style landslide if repeated at a general election. On a victory tour of the constituencies this morning, he said the result “reflects, I think, the mood of the country”. Voters “can see a changed Labour Party making a positive case about the future; making that case for better living standards,” he said. “People are listening, putting their trust and confidence in us. We respect that, that is precious”. He added: “I know there are people who probably voted Tory in the past who voted for a changed Labour Party because they despair at the state of their own party.” While saying he accepted these votes “humbly”, Starmer cited Blair’s three victories as an example to emulate. While stressing that “we face different times”, he told Sky News: “What I do want to do is follow in the footsteps of a leader of our party who took us from opposition into power.” In Mid Bedfordshire Alistair Strathern overturned a bigger majority than any other Labour candidate since 1945. He won by just over 1,000 votes after a heated three-way race between Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Tories. In Tamworth Sarah Edwards overturned a 19,000 Conservative majority. Labour will hope that the result is an echo of history — the party won the constituency from the Tories in a by-election in 1996, before winning a landslide at the general election the following year. Rishi Sunak has sought to insist that he is the candidate for change and dismissed crushing defeats in by-elections as the natural result for “incumbent governments”. The prime minister made his first public comments on big losses for the Conservatives, saying they were “obviously disappointing results”. Sunak argued he was bringing a different approach to No 10, highlighting the strategy he adopted at the Conservative Party conference this month. He used his conference speech to present his own premiership as a break with a Westminster’s “false consensus” in an implicit acceptance of voters’ desire for change. Speaking from Egypt Sunak said it was “important to remember the context; mid-term elections are always difficult for incumbent governments”. He added that “of course there are also local factors at play here”, in a reference to the acrimonious resignation of Nadine Dorries in Mid Bedfordshire, and the drunken groping scandal that forced out Chris Pincher in Tamworth. Sunak said that “in the past month, I’ve set out some long-term decisions that will change our country for the better”, citing his scrapping of the northern leg of HS2, a phased smoking ban and reform of A-levels. “Those are the type of decisions that I’m making for our country. That is the change that we’re going to bring,” Sunak added. Twin Conservative by-election losses “did not show a swing to Labour”, Gillian Keegan has argued (Chris Smyth writes). Despite the Tories’ losing Mid Bedfordshire and Tamworth with swings of more than 20 per cent, the education secretary insisted there “was no real love for Labour” in the results. “On the doorsteps there were very, very few people who were switching over,” she told ITV News. “People stayed at home.” Keegan said that the government “have to deliver” for their voters, adding: “We still have to demonstrate to them that it’s worth getting out of their house and voting Conservative. But if you look at the details, this did not show a swing to Labour, it showed Conservative voters not coming out.” Anthony Wells, director of political research at YouGov, said this misunderstood swing votes. “You never get that many direct switchers, a lot of the swing is people staying at home or moving to third parties,” he said. “But clearly there are some people who have moved to Labour [in these by-elections]. It’s not a viable hypothesis that a lot of Tories stayed at home but all Labour’s voters from 2019 came out. And if that was the case it would be pretty worrying for the government because it would show Labour voters were very enthused.” Conservative ministers have come out after the by-election loss and said they have found no love for the Labour leader on the doorstep. Most people who voted Labour and talked to The Times said they did so in opposition to the Conservatives, rather than out of an enthusiasm for Sir Keir Starmer (Will Humphries writes). Les Redmond, 61, a retired telecoms engineer, voted for Labour while his partner Lorraine Lithgo, 64, voted Tory. “The last election I voted for the Monster Raving Loony Party,” he said. “I couldn’t vote for Labour then because I didn’t want Jeremy Corbyn. But I don’t like Keir Starmer [either], I think he is a bit smarmy and he keeps going back on what he says.” Lithgo said she “preferred the values” of the Tory candidate and liked that “he is a local man”. Keith, 71, a lifelong Labour voter, said he was happy with “any result as long as the Conservatives didn’t get in”. Joseph Kamga, 51, began the Bedford Coffee Roasters company after losing his job as an accountant’s assistant during the pandemic. He said the results was a “punishment for the Conservatives”. Kamga is a staunch Labour voter but said he doesn’t like Starmer. “He is too New Labour, too Tony Blair, how can you afford to sack someone like Jeremy Corbyn,” he said. “I am not a great fan of Keir Starmer but we haven’t got any choice.” Mid Bedfordshire, the historically Tory stronghold of a patchwork of small rural towns and villages, has never had a Labour MP. However, a combination of disgust at the “neglect” of their constituency by Nadine Dorries, the outgoing MP, and the behaviour of the national party in recent years caused many to vote Labour for the first time (Will Humphries writes). Anthony Clifton, 80, said Labour and the Lib Dems had been campaigning hard in the villages and towns but he hadn’t seen the Tory candidate at all. “I think if you are an MP for that area you have to be prepared to get out and meet the people and talk to the people because we are the ones who will put them where they are,” he said. Shirley, 68, who works in the local Tesco, said she normally backed Labour but had voted Conservative in 2019 “purely because of Brexit”. She returned to Labour at the by-election because “I just feel the Conservatives have let me down”. She said she doesn’t like the “money that’s been wasted” on immigration policies like the Rwanda scheme and the migrant barge. Nadine Dorries hadn’t been visible in her constituency “for years” and emails to her office often went unanswered, residents of Mid Bedfordshire have said (Will Humphries writes). The final insult for many was her drawn-out resignation, which lasted from early June when she first pledged to leave the Commons after being denied a peerage, until late August, when she finally did so, triggering the by-election. A church volunteer in her sixties said she had changed her vote from the Tories to Labour and most of her friends had done the same. “I don’t know anyone who voted Conservative,” she said. “For me it was Nadine Dorries and Liz Truss, and Brexit, and Boris partying — just the whole lot of their atrocious behaviour, and my friends are the same. “I think [the by-election result] was caused by a strong older lady vote. You wouldn’t think it of affluent older ladies [to vote Labour] but it was a good campaign from Labour, very well presented.” Robert Redman, 61, a former Conservative voter who works in financial services, said he voted Labour on Thursday because “we have been underrepresented by the Tories for such a long time” and it was “shambolic” the way the central party hadn’t tackled Dorries neglecting her constituency. He said he “never saw a Tory once” during the campaign. The Tories drew the “wrong conclusion” from their by-election victory in Uxbridge and South Ruislip earlier this year by dropping pledges on the transition to net zero (Steven Swinford writes). Lord Barwell, a Tory peer and former chief of staff to Theresa May, said that the approach and Rishi Sunak’s conference speech “had no impact” on the Conservative Party’s electoral prospects. The Tories unexpectedly won Uxbridge by turning the by-election into an effective referendum on the Ultra Low Emissions Zone, a charge on more polluting cars. Barwell said: “These by-election results are as bad as Selby & Somerton back in July (Tamworth is the second-highest swing Labour have ever achieved to gain a seat from the Conservatives)... Back in July, everyone focused on Uxbridge. Conclusions were drawn even though it was clear at the time it was down to a *local* issue and Selby & Somerton were more likely to represent the national mood. Tamworth and Mid Beds confirm that was a serious mistake.” The by-election results are even worse for the Tories than the national polls suggest, a Conservative peer has said. Lord Frost, the former chief Brexit negotiator and Tory minister, said the party could not pursue a “strategy of denial” in response to the results and that it would not help to suggest “as some party figures have done” anything other than an “extremely bad” outcome for the Conservatives. On Twitter/X, he wrote: “The current national polls are dreadful for us but these results are even worse. The very worst current polls show us holding 100-150 seats at an election. But Tamworth is our 55th safest seat. “Yes things are different at by-elections and there were probably special factors. But these results show that the national polls are broadly correct and that a strategy of denial is unlikely to work. “If your voters don’t want to come out and vote for you then you don’t win elections. It’s as simple as that.” His post was liked by Nadine Dorries, whose resignation caused the by-election in Mid Bedfordshire. In Tamworth, 67.5 per cent of voters voted for Brexit in the referendum in 2016. Many there, however, now consider the matter settled and are preoccupied with problems such as the cost of living and the state of their town in general. The Staffordshire market town had a Labour MP between 1997 and 2005. Nathan Colbert, 39, who works in engineering, said that Brexit had not been a factor when he chose to vote for Labour for the first time in his life. “I’ve always voted Conservative. But the Conservatives are a joke and I just fancied a change, we needed a change in Tamworth,” he said. “I was happy with Brexit but we’ve had a lot since then. It’s on to what next now, what the future holds. We need to get Tamworth back to where it used to be 20 years ago and I think the Conservatives have ruined it.” David Bridgewater, 73, who has not always voted Conservative, said: “I did vote Conservative last time, mainly because of Brexit. I think Brexit is separate now, that’s been done and dusted and I just think we need a change and I think the Labour Party is the party to do it.” Sir Keir Starmer has said that the two by-election victories for his party were a “game-changer” and there is nowhere in the country the Labour Party cannot “put up a fight” (Geraldine Scott writes). In Marston Moretaine in the Mid Bedfordshire constituency, the Labour leader said his party would “repay” voters for their “trust and confidence” and said that he accepted the wins “humbly”. He added that there were no longer any safe seats and that voters were “crying out for change”. Starmer told supporters he hoped the wins would “persuade other voters across the country who may have voted for other parties in the past that the party of the future, the party of national renewal to reject the decline of the last 30 years, is this changed Labour Party”. He told                     BBC Breakfast                    : “We know that we have to earn every vote.” Asked whether there were now any seats Labour could not challenge, he said: “No, I think this really is a game-changer, there is a confidence now in this changed Labour Party that we can go anywhere across the country, put up a fight and win seats that we’ve never won before.” In a direct appeal to Tory voters “who care desperately about their country”, he said Labour was the party to “take our country forward”. Starmer said the wins showed Labour was “redrawing the political map”. Conservative MPs are turning on each other in the fallout over the losses in Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire (Geraldine Scott writes). Alex Stafford, the MP for Rother Valley, posted in a Tory MP Whatsapp group that Conservative voters “stayed at home, they didn’t switch”. He reassured colleagues: “Come the general [election] the public who sat on their hands will come out to back us.” But the message, leaked to Sky News, was called “deluded” by one MP, and Jonathan Gullis, the MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, told his fellow Tories: “Whoever text [Sky journalist] Beth Rigby this below. Simple message for you”, before adding an emoji of a raised middle finger. Sir Robert Buckland, the former cabinet minister, earlier warned  the Tories  they could not descend into infighting after the results. But there has already been suggestions MPs could submit letters of no confidence in Rishi Sunak, and Michael Fabricant, the MP for Lichfield, highlighted a poll in The Times Red Box on whether Greg Hands, the party chairman, should resign. However, another Tory MP told The Times that any move to change the leadership would be “suicide”. If the Mid Bedfordshire by-election swing was replicated across the country, the Tories would be left with just 20 seats and Labour with 480 (Geraldine Scott writes). Labour made history in winning Mid Bedfordshire — which has elected a Tory MP continuously since it was created in 1931 until now. The party won with a swing of 20.5 percentage points and boosted their vote share from 22 per cent to 34 per cent. The Electoral Maps UK Twitter/X account — with the disclaimer that their analysis was just for fun — said if the same swing was replicated across the country Labour would end up with 480 seats, the Lib Dems with 104, the SNP with 23 and the Conservatives with 20. The swing was even larger in Tamworth at 23.9 percentage points — the second largest swing record for Labour at a by-election since 1945. The largest was 29.1 points at the Dudley West by-election in December 1994. Electoral Maps UK said if this were replicated nationwide, Labour would finish with 537 seats, the Lib Dems with 46, Conservatives with 29 and the SNP with 17. Both Conservative candidates headed straight for the door at their by-election counts once they found out they had lost (Geraldine Scott writes). It is convention that unsuccessful candidates stay to hear the speech given by the winner. But videos showed Andrew Cooper in Tamworth and Festus Akinbusoye in Mid Bedfordshire leaving as soon as the results were announced. In one video Cooper, who was reported to have been at the count only for about five minutes, was seen looking glum on the stage before being shepherded out by Tory party staff. Sarah Edwards, the new Labour MP, told ITV News: “We have seen his true colours, it is a shame.” In Mid Bedfordshire Akinbusoye also left quickly, but did shake hands with Alistair Strathern, the new Labour MP. The scale of the Tory defeat at the next general election may be worse than that seen in 1997, Professor Sir John Curtice has said (Geraldine Scott writes). The polling expert said it was “certainly reasonable” to argue that the Tories were facing “Armageddon” — the term used by the former Conservative chancellor George Osborne about the latest defeats. Curtice told                     Today                     on BBC Radio 4: “I think it’s certainly reasonable to argue. I would have said it was reasonable to argue 24 hours ago that the Conservative Party faces the serious prospect of losing the next general election heavily, and maybe even more heavily than they did in 1997.” He said that when it came to comparing recent by-elections with those before the 1997 general election, they were “commensurate” with that “crucial time”. John Curtice: No silver lining for Tories in by-election drubbings Neither Tamworth nor Mid Bedfordshire were on Labour’s target list for the next general election and needed “huge, huge swings” to win, the party’s national campaign co-ordinator has said (Geraldine Scott writes). Pat McFadden told                     Today                     on BBC Radio 4 that the by-election wins were “fantastic” results because the pulic had thought that the Tory majorities were too large to overturn. “A lot of people thought we couldn’t do that,” he said. “And they indicate that the country is turning its back on the Conservatives and is looking to a changed Labour Party.” He added, however: “We also know we’ve still got a long way to go.” McFadden warned that Labour should “be aware of the size of the task, because the trust of the public is a very fragile and precious thing”. Jess Phillips, the Labour MP, accused the Conservatives of having run a “wholly negative campaign in Tamworth”. She said: “They sought to waste police time reporting her [Sarah Edwards, the Labour candidate] to police just so they could get a bogus headline. I’d normally have sympathy for candidates who found it tough, it’s not easy, but they sought to make it harder.” The Tories had accused Labour of breaking electoral law by claiming that Edwards lived in Tamworth while owning a home in a suburb of Birmingham. Police declined to investigate. The two damaging by-election results for Rishi Sunak will round off a first 12 months as prime minister in which he has been haunted by the ghosts of Conservative prime ministers past (Geraldine Scott writes). The losses in Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire arrived exactly a year after Liz Truss resigned. Her disastrous mini-budget is still used by opposition parties to attack the Tories over the cost of living crisis and high household bills. The causes of the by-elections are also hangovers. Chris Pincher, the former deputy chief whip, resigned after he was found to have groped two men, but the handling of the scandal was the final straw that brought down Boris Johnson’s government. Johnson was also a factor in Nadine Dorries’s resignation in Mid Bedfordshire — she quit after being denied a peerage in his resignation honours. Greg Hands, the Tory chairman, said the government had been hit with “legacy factors, things that pre-dated Rishi Sunak” in the two by-elections. Greg Hands will not resign as Conservative Party chairman after the party lost two by-elections overnight (Geraldine Scott writes). Last year — the last time the Tories lost two by-elections in one night — Oliver Dowden resigned from the same job, saying that someone “must take responsibility”. Wakefield was won by Labour and Tiverton & Honiton went to the Liberal Democrats. Hands told Sky News that his job now was to find ways to “energise” Tory voters who had stayed at home. He said: “I think we fought good campaigns. We have excellent candidates and we’ll be hopefuls of regaining those two seats at the general election expected next year.” Asked whether he was considering his position he said: “No, I’m going to be looking at the dynamics of the operation of those by-elections, but I think we had a very good campaign, we had good candidates. We just need to find a way of incentivising Conservatives to turn up to vote next year for the general election. But I’m confident that we will be able to do that.” In both by-elections, the vote share for Reform UK was greater than the Labour majority (Geraldine Scott writes). “Twice in same night have Reform ensured Tories lost their seat with this by-election result,” the party leader Richard Tice wrote on Twitter/X. “This despite huge squeeze pressure from Tories to voters saying do not vote Reform.” Tice’s party won 1,373 votes (5.4 per cent) in Tamworth and 1,487 votes (3.7 per cent) in Mid Bedfordshire. Labour’s majorities in the two seats were 1,316 in Tamworth and 1,192 in Mid Bedfordshire. The Conservative Party needs to make “far-reaching major changes now” after two by-election losses, one of its MPs has said (Geraldine Scott writes). Dame Andrea Jenkyns, who is on the right of the party, said “voter apathy is evident yet again” after Labour won in both Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire. She said: “We need to make far reaching major changes now to instil confidence in the Conservative voters.” Conservative voters’ decision to stay at home and not vote in yesterday’s by-elections is a “big issue” for the Tory party, its chairman has said (Geraldine Scott writes). Greg Hands told Times Radio the results in Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire overnight were “disappointing … we would have hoped to have done better”. However, he said that the Labour vote had “hardly increased at all” and said the government losses showed it had been “overwhelmingly the case that the previous Conservative voters stayed home”. He said: “That is obviously a big issue for us, we need to think about how we can deliver better, and deliver the message better to the people who would likely be supporting the Conservatives in next year’s general election.” Hands added that the party could tempt those voters out with “good old-fashioned competent Conservative government”. The Tories need to focus on “serious, grown-up” policy rather than infighting after the by-election results, a former cabinet minister has said. Sir Robert Buckland told the BBC: “I think that as Conservatives, we now need to make it very clear what the next five years is going to look like, and that’s what I’m looking for from the Prime Minister and our leaders. “I’m not looking for academic arguments about issues that are not going to swing voters. I’m looking for serious, grown-up approaches to the issues that really matter – on the economy, on housing, on the future for our young people. “We’ve got some good Conservative answers to these issues. Let’s hear them and let’s hear nothing else in the next 12 months.” The Conservatives are “staring defeat in the face” at a general election unless they can “dramatically” turn things around, polling expert Sir John Curtice has said. Curtice said the two losses to Labour did not indicate that the next election was doomed for the Tories. But he said the results were ”extremely bad news” for the government. He said: “This isn’t destiny, but it is a pointer and it is a pointer that, unless the Conservatives can fairly dramatically and fairly radically turn things around, then they are in truth staring defeat in the face in 12 months’ time.” He warned the Tories risked seeing votes drift to Labour on the left and Reform UK on the right. He told the BBC: “No government has hitherto lost to the principal opposition party in a by-election a seat as safe as Tamworth.” He added that the Tories “may get caught in a pincer movement between some of their former Leave voters wandering off to Labour but others going off to Reform UK”. Results overnight are not “gigantic by-election defeats” for the Tories, a minister has insisted, with voters “reserving their judgement” ahead of the next election. Andrew Bowie, an energy minister, said the Labour wins in Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire meant “obviously we’ve got to take notice and listen to what the voters are telling us”. But he told Sky News: “What’s been quite clear on the doorsteps is that people actually do agree with our priorities, do agree with what we are doing, but they are reserving judgement when it comes to who they’re going to vote for in the next general election.” Asked whether that meant the message from the “two gigantic by-election defeats” was, therefore, to change nothing, Bowie said: “Well, they weren’t gigantic by-election defeats, I think they were both within the region of 2,000 votes between the Conservatives and the Labour Party.” He added: “What that tells me is that people are supportive of what we’re doing, but they just were not prepared to come out and vote for us.” A minister blamed the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for the loss of two Conservative seats to Labour (writes Geraldine Scott, Senior Political Correspondent). Maria Caulfield, a health minister, said there was “not a huge appetite for Labour” on the doorsteps despite Sir Keir Starmer’s party winning two previously safe Tory seats overnight. She said people would often vote differently in a general election to a by-election. Asked on Sky News why Rishi Sunak was not getting the right results, she said: “Because I think people have had a very tough time over the last four years. “If you look just weeks after the last general election we went into Covid and that’s been a really tricky time despite the help of the government.” She added: “A few weeks after restrictions were lifted, Ukraine was invaded by Russia and we’ve all felt the impact of high energy bills, inflation, interest rates, which has been a knock on effect from that.” She said: “People have had a hard time and they want to send that message to the government that they’re struggling but by no means is there a love for Keir Starmer or the Labour Party.” It is an ominous sign for Rishi Sunak, a year out from a general election (writes Geraldine Scott, Senior Political Correspondent). While true that sitting governments often do not win by-elections, and while true both by-elections overnight were held under the shadow of high-profile scandals, the results of the two votes, with historic wins for Labour, will still send chills through Conservative headquarters. In the last month, Labour has shown it can win in dramatically different seats - in Mid Bedfordshire, a typical Tory stronghold, in Tamworth, which showed a chink in the Red Wall before we even used the term Red Wall, and in Rutherglen and Hamilton West, a sign of Labour’s clawback against the SNP. The results are more than even the party expected - one Labour figure confided they had bet against the party in at least one of the polls. Labour strategists will often speak of the broad coalition of voters Labour needed to secure a general election victory. There is no route to No 10 without rural seats/the Red Wall/Scotland/urban votes, they will say, deleting as appropriate. But this morning, Alistair Strathern, the party’s newest MP, said: “Nowhere is off limits for this Labour Party.” The fear for Sunak is he might be right. The shadow cabinet member Peter Kyle said Labour had delivered a “political earthquake” to Rishi Sunak’s Conservatives following the double by-election win. “This is a huge night,” said Kyle at the Mid Bedfordshire count, where he celebrated with new MP Alistair Strathern. “Make no bones about it. This is a political earthquake that has unfolded here. “This is the biggest by-election shock in history; it is a political earthquake, and it is one that is sending an unignorable message to Westminster and to Rishi Sunak that this country deserves better.” Labour’s wins at Mid Bedfordshire and Tamworth mean swings of over 20 percentage points have occurred at eight by-elections in the past three years. Five of the eight swings have occurred in the past four months: Selby & Ainsty (23.7 points from Conservatives to Labour) and Somerton & Frome (29.0 points from Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats) in July; Rutherglen & Hamilton West (20.4 points from the SNP to Labour) earlier this month, and now Mid Bedfordshire (20.5 points) and Tamworth (23.9 points), both from Conservatives to Labour. The others were Tiverton & Honiton (29.9 points) in June 2022, North Shropshire (34.1 points) in December 2021, and Chesham & Amersham (25.2 points) in June 2021, all from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats. The Mid Bedfordshire result breaks the record for the largest numerical majority overturned at a by-election. The record partly reflects the unusually large electorate (92,578). The dual victory in Mid Bedfordshire and Tamworth marks the first time Labour have made two by-election gains on the same day since 1962. Alistair Strathern said his win in Mid Bedfordshire sent a “resounding message” to the Conservative Party and the country as a whole. He said: “Tonight residents across Mid Bedfordshire have made history, after decades of being taken for granted, feeling left behind, being under-represented, they made a decision it was time for a change. “Nowhere is off limits for this Labour Party and tonight’s result proves it.” In Mid Bedfordshire, both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have believed they are the best-placed challengers to the 24,664 Tory majority. It has led to those supporting Alistair Strathern, the Labour candidate, and Emma Holland-Lindsay, the Lib Dem candidate, finding themselves in verbal confrontations while going door to door, as Geraldine Scott wrote last month:  Claws out in three-way fight This month Sir Keir Starmer hailed a “big step in the right direction” after an emphatic by-election win for his party in the Scottish seat of Rutherglen & Hamilton West, with a higher-than-expected 20.4 percentage point swing from the SNP. Sir John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said that if the Rutherglen result was replicated in the general election next year it would mean Labour winning 42 seats in Scotland and SNP only six. Both the Conservative Party and Labour have held their conferences this month, but the mood was very different. Publicly, Labour’s messaging has been deliberately cautious but behind the scenes the atmosphere was triumphant. Read Steven Swinford and Oliver Wright’s piece:  Disciplined Labour dancing behind the scenes Tamworth is often considered a bellwether constituency, having returned a Labour MP throughout the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown years before electing Pincher in 2010. However, it was among the seats the Tories would have deemed safe before last year, with a majority of almost 20,000. Tom Ball visited the seat this month. Read his dispatch:  Tories face wipeout In Mid Bedfordshire, Festus Akinbusoye, the local Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC), is fighting to keep the Tories in a seat the party has held since 1931. Looking to overturn former MP Nadine Dorries’ majority of nearly 25,000, Labour selected Alistair Strathern, a local councilor and climate lead at the Bank of England, while the Liberal Democrats chose Emma Holland-Lindsay. The latest polls show a tight three-way split between the candidates, with each party throwing huge resources at the contest. In August, Labour candidate Strathern was criticised after it was revealed he had been part of a Greenpeace stunt in which he dressed up as a zombie alongside a gravestone. He described the attacks as “desperate” but the criticism has likely weakened his chances in the Home Counties seat. Akinbusoye also caused controversy when he refused to step down from his PCC role during campaigning, despite a letter signed by several members of the police and crime commissioner panel calling for him to resign. Holland-Lindsay is also a councillor — she represents Leighton Buzzard for the Lib Dems on Central Bedfordshire council and won her seat earlier this year. She is head of public affairs for the National Federation of Women’s Institutes. She says she has worked to improve NHS services while a councillor, a key pillar of her campaign in Mid Bedfordshire. In Tamworth, Andrew Cooper, a local councillor and former army sniper, is defending a Conservative majority of nearly 20,000 against Labour’s Sarah Edwards, a Unite union official from Moseley who has worked at charity Oxfam. Cooper was widely criticised when it emerged that he had used profane language about people who pay for £30 phone contracts while on benefits. Labour said his comments showed a “complete lack of understanding” about the issues facing the area. Sarah Edwards, a former NHS governor, has focused her campaign around a pledge to tackle the cost of living crisis, boost public services and protect greenfield land. At the closing of the polls, both Labour and the Tories attempted to play down expectations (Geraldine Scott writes). A Conservative spokesman said: “These were always going to be challenging by-elections and the rule of thumb is that governments don’t win them. We have seen little to no enthusiasm for Sir Keir Starmer who voters can see stands for nothing and always puts short-term political gain first. “It is clear that we have to maintain our focus on people’s immediate priorities whilst taking long-term decisions which will lead to the change this country needs.” Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign co-ordinator, said: “We have known all along that winning these seats would be a long shot, with huge majorities to overturn. The fact that we are even on the pitch is a sign of how far the Labour Party has changed. We are making real progress in all corners of our country and showing that with Labour, we can get Britain’s future back.” Christine Jardine, the Liberal Democrats’ cabinet office spokeswoman, added: “Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the Lib Dem vote has surged in true blue villages across Bedfordshire, as former lifelong Conservative voters choose to send this government a message.” The Tory party has said it faces “difficult headwinds” in the two constituencies, with Rishi Sunak’s press secretary saying they had come about after “difficult local circumstances”. Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary, quit her Mid Bedfordshire seat after she was not given a peerage in Boris Johnson’s resignation honours list, leading her to accuse Rishi Sunak of abandoning “the fundamental principles of conservatism”. Chris Pincher, who had represented Tamworth since 2010, stood down after being found by parliament’s standards committee to have drunkenly groped two men in an “egregious case of sexual misconduct” at London’s Carlton Club last year.
