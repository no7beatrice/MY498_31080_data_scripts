   Tata Steel: Port Talbot closure forces UK to rely on China for steel as MP raises ‘national security’ concerns The Independent (United Kingdom) January 15, 2024 Monday 11:27 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: UK POLITICS,UK; Version:157 Length: 8397 words Byline: Matt Mathers Highlight: About 2,800 jobs will go over the next 18 months, with a further 300 to be lost after Body   Tata’s decision to axe 3,000 jobs at its plant in South Wales will leave the UK reliant on foreign steel imports for years to come, as an MP warned the move raised “serious questions” about national security. Stephen Kinnock, the shadow minister for immigration and Labour MP for Aberavon -home of the Port Talbot steelworks -said the move leaves the UK the only G20 country unable to make “its own steel from scratch”. Earlier Tata confirmed plans to close blast furnaces at the plant, with the loss of more than 3,000 jobs. About 2,800 jobs will go over the next 18 months , with a further 300 to be lost after. The Indian-owned firm said the plans were aimed at “reversing more than a decade of losses”. The move also sparked outrage among several unions. A statement by the GMB and Community said: “It is an absolute disgrace that Tata Steel, and the UK government, appear intent on pursuing the cheapest instead of the best plan for our industry, our steelworkers and our country.”                      Key Points                                                                Tata Steel confirms decision to axe 3,000 jobs                       ‘Dogs in the street’ know Rwanda plan won’t work, senior Tory says                       Sunak braces for battle to get legislation through Lords                                                Rwanda Bill passes Commons                      Britain will be forced to rely on steel from India and China after Tata closures in Port Talbot                    The closure of two blast furnaces at Britain’s biggest steelworks will lead to thousands of job losses and leave the UK reliant on foreign steel imports for years to come.  In a fresh blow to Rishi Sunak, as the UK teeters on the brink of recession, Tata Steel  said it is cutting 2,800 jobs at its plant in Port Talbot , south Wales.  It came as the steel giant confirmed it is closing both blast furnaces at the site.

Tata  said its plans are subject to consultation but could be expected to result in up to 2,800 potential job losses across the business out of which, around 2,500 roles could be impacted during the next 18 months.

The Indian-owned steel giant said it was “not feasible or affordable ” to adopt a plan put forward by the GMB  and Community  unions to keep the furnaces open while transitioning to a greener production method.

Talking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “There was a postmistress up in Perthsire [..] and just last month, she had a shortfall of £414.

Law Society urges House of Lords to delay ratification of Rwanda treaty                    Following news that the Lords’ International Agreements Committee has recommended that the Rwanda treaty is not ratified, the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, has said the treaty should be delayed until Rwanda has proven that it is now safe for asylum seekers,Holly Bancroft reports. Vice president Richard Atkinson said: “We are pleased to see the Committee shares our view that the conclusion of the Rwanda treaty in itself does not make Rwanda a safe country to send asylum seekers to. “The Supreme Court ruled that the policy is unlawful on a point of fact, based on a core and well-established principle of international and domestic law, non-refoulement. “It is a fact that Rwanda is not considered a safe country given the high risk of refoulement of asylum seekers. “The signing of a treaty does not change this finding of fact." He added: “There are serious questions about the effectiveness of the treaty which we urge the House of Lords to probe carefully. “At the very least, peers should endorse the Committee’s recommendation that ratification be delayed until the mechanisms and safeguards in the treaty have been fully implemented.”                      Stephen Kinnock’s anger at Tata Steel Port Talbot closure: ‘UK only G20 country that can’t make primary steel’                    MP’s anger at Tata Steel closure: UK only G20 country that can’t make primary steel                      No 10 ‘confident’ Rwanda will improve asylum systems in time for treaty to be ratified                    Downing Street said it was “confident” Rwanda would implement improved measures into its asylum system in time for a new treaty with the UK being ratified by parliament. It comes after the House of Lords International Agreements Committee said “significant legal and practical steps” must be taken before Rwanda can be deemed safe and the treaty approved by Westminster. Asked whether ministers would be following through on the committee’s recommendations, a spokeswoman for the prime minister said: “So I think more broadly on the process, we will let it follow its course as it is looked at in the Lords. We will consider issues that are raised — motions and amendments — in the usual way.” On the matter of the treaty, she said: “In terms of the improvements and the assurances that we have with the government of Rwanda, we are confident that there will be implementation of all of those measures in line with the timelines for the treaty. “So those assurances that we provided, which responded to issues raised by the Supreme Court, will be in place when we get flights off the ground.” Asked whether the government would comply if peers pass a motion designed to provide assurances over the treaty, the spokeswoman said: “I’m not going to get ahead of parliamentary processes and processes in the Lord’s — that starts to get into hypotheticals.”                      Sunak: I won’t pack more peers into Lords to get Rwanda Bill through                    Rishi Sunak played down the prospect of putting more peers into the House of Lords to pass the Rwanda Bill. Speaking to reporters in Hampshire, he said: “We shouldn’t be talking about these things because the House of Lords will be able to see that this is part of the strong majority in the Commons, they can see that this is a national priority. “And I would urge them strongly to crack on with it because we all just want to get this done. “The country is fed up and frustrated with the merry-go-round on this topic. “I think people can appreciate that we have made progress last year, but we now need to finish the job and that’s why we should pass this scheme as quickly as possible.”                      Sunak: I’m determined to get Rwanda bill through Lords                    Rishi Sunak said that he is “determined” to get his Rwanda Bill through parliament, with the legislation set for stern opposition in the House of Lords. Speaking to broadcasters while on a visit to Hampshire, the prime minister said: “I think it’s really important that we stop the boats, it’s one of the priorities I set out to the country last year. “I am pleased our plan is working and that we’re making progress. The numbers last year were down by over a third, that hasn’t happened before, so that shows that we can make a difference here. “In order to fully solve this problem we need to have a deterrent, so that when people come here illegally they won’t be able to stay and will be removed. “That is why the Rwanda scheme is so important, and that’s why I’m determined to get it through parliament and get it up and running as quickly as possible so we can properly solve this problem. “We have got a plan, this plan is working, if we stick with it we can deliver the change people want to see.”                      Brexit U-turn as EU citizens who missed residency deadline allowed to stay in UK                                                                Rishi Sunak                     ’s government has made a U-turn on residency rights of EU citizens which makes it easier for them to stay in the UK. New guidance from the Home Office says it will no longer block Europeans making late applications for settled status if they were unaware of the Brexit scheme.

The former president pursued an “America first” policy while in the White House and has floated an automatic 10 per cent tariff and all goods imported to the US if he beats Joe Biden this year. “I don’t support protectionist measures,” the chancellor said when asked at the Davos summit if he was concerned about the potential impact a Trump presidency could have on the UK economy. “I think they harm the people who introduce them as much as the people they are aimed at.”                      ‘Completely ridiculous’ to exclude women from football punditry -Sunak                    Rishi Sunak suggested it is “completely ridiculous” to exclude women from football punditry and said he would love for one of his daughters to grow up to be a commentator. The prime minister said the profession should be “open to everybody”. His comments come after sports minister Stuart Andrew condemned “dangerous” comments made by former footballer Joey Barton about women football pundits. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to Hampshire, he said: “I listen to all sorts of conversations and they’re all great. It shouldn’t really matter really, quite frankly. “I mean, what we care about is the quality of the commentating and… I don’t get to watch or listen to as much football as I’d like… but obviously, that’s completely ridiculous. “I have two young girls and I’d love it if one of them wanted to be a football commentator when they grew up but I sadly think that it’s unlikely to happen. I’ve failed to get them into it and support Saints the way I do, but there you go. But yeah, of course it should be open to everybody.”                      ICYMI: Rishi Sunak set for titanic battle with Lords over Rwanda bill                    Defiant peers have rejected Rishi Sunak ’s warning not to frustrate “the will of the people”  by opposing his flagship Rwanda  legislation, as the prime minister  heads for a showdown with the House of Lords.

Stephen Kinnock, Labour MP for Aberavon -home of the Port Talbot steelworks -told Sky News: “The steelworks here in Port Talbot is the beating heart of our economy and of our community. “Multi-unions (sic) have come together and put a plan on the table which would actually be much more of a bridge rather than a cliff edge to the changes that we know have to take place within our steel industry. “But instead of that, we have got a plan which has been cobbled together between Tata Steel and the UK government which is going to use £500 million of taxpayers’ money to make 3,000 men and women redundant. “And it is also going to remove the British capability to make its own steel from scratch. “We will become the only country in the G20 that is no longer able to do that, so that is not the right way to go. Tata Steel should really look again at the multi-union proposal.” More comments from Mr Kinnock below:                       Labour MP for Aberavon in Port Talbot @SKinnock  said it is "deeply, deeply disappointing" that it appears Tata Steel will close blast furnaces at the steelworks.Sky News understands this will be confirmed in an announcement at 11am.https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3  Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/RwqWqBrKOx — Sky News (@SkyNews) January 19, 2024                                           Jeremy Hunt hints at more tax cuts before general election                                          08:55 , Matt Mathers Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has signalled he wants to cut taxes in the Budget, as the Tories gear up for an election in the face of dire poll ratings.Tory MPs are clamouring for a move that would win votes as the latest opinion poll by YouGov shows support for the Tories is at its lowest level since Liz Truss’s final days as prime minister.Holding out the prospect of more money for the NHS, families and the armed forces, Mr Hunt said he wanted to focus on growth in the Budget on 6 March.Jane Dalton has more details: Jeremy Hunt hints at more tax cuts before general election Government has ‘no industrial strategy’ -Labour08:40 , Matt Mathers The government has “no industrial strategy”, says shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock,Zoe Grunewald reports.Mr Kinnock has accused the government of “sitting on its hands” over the expected closure of the Tate steel plant.He told Times Radio it was “deeply frustrating” that the government implemented a “short term plan” by pursuing a narrow Electric Arc Furnace-only model, rather than innovate.Tata Steel is expected to confirm plans to press ahead with plans to close both blast furnaces at its biggest plant, likely resulting in more than 3,000 job losses.Home Office using dummy plane to practice forcing migrants onto Rwanda flights08:25 , Matt Mathers The Home Office  has hired an aircraft hangar and a dummy plane  for security officials to practise forcing asylum seekers  onto flights to Rwanda , it has emerged.As the government prepares for deportation flights  to take off, security guards have undergone special training programmes to deal with disruptive people.Archie Mitchell reports: Home Office hires dummy plane to practice forcing migrants onto Rwanda flights ‘Dogs in the street’ know Rwanda flights are ‘probably never going to happen’ -senior Tory08:07 , Matt Mathers A senior Conservative peer has cast doubt about whether prime minister Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda policy will ever see asylum seekers deported to east Africa.Ahead of the House of Lords debating the Safety of Rwanda Bill, former Scottish Tory leader Baroness Ruth Davidson said there “are dogs in the street that know” that deportation flights are “probably never going to happen”.In comments made to The Today Podcast and broadcast on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Lady Davidson said: “Let’s have a debate about immigration, absolutely.“Every sovereign nation should be in charge of who comes in; not everybody has a right to go to every country in the world — I completely get all of that.

We publish a wide range of statistical information and continue to do so.“We also linked through to the full story on Gov.uk with the details of our update on the legacy backlog and the PM was referring to a commitment he himself made and spoke about. But of course we will note the letter and consider it to ensure we can be as clear and transparent as possible.”ICYMI: Sunak rapped by watchdog over claim to have ‘cleared’ asylum backlogThursday 18 January 2024 18:00 , Matt Mathers The UK’s statistics watchdog  has slammed Rishi Sunak  for his repeated claim to have “cleared”  the asylum  backlog – and warned the assertion could erode trust in the government.Sir Robert Chote , the chair of the UK Statistics Authority, also said voters may have felt “misled”.

He chairs cabinet meetings with great efficiency. He’s read everything, understood everything. He knows what the issues that are contentious, that we have to discuss, are about.

Mr Sunak confirmed – as was already known -that the hotly contentious Rwanda bill would now be making its way into the Lords, having passed its third reading last night. He called upon peers to pass it. He could not provide any new information, such as when the first flight to Rwanda might take off, nor whether the government would succeed in its pledge to stop the boats entirely.Rather, the press conference simply confirmed two things. First, that Mr Sunak is measuring the success of his premiership on whether the Rwanda scheme lives or dies. By drawing attention to its successful passage through the Commons, he is highlighting its importance -and his success. He is making Rwanda his personal yard-stick. Second, that the prime minister is haunted by division. Having government legislation pass in the Commons should not worthy of a press briefing, it is a basic expectation of governance. But Mr Sunak’s party is so very fractured that the simplest achievement, for a moment, seemed impossible. The prime minister may have wished to demonstrate that his victory in the Conservative power struggle yesterday is evidence that he is a strong and competent leader. But the reality is that many will still be asking why it was all so difficult in the first place.When are the House of Lords set to debate Sunak’s Rwanda plan?Thursday 18 January 2024 12:45 , Joe Middleton The BBC’s chief political correspondent Henry Zeffman has posted the rough timetable for when the House of Lords will debate Rishi Sunak’s controversial Rwanda scheme.When will the Lords debate Rwanda?

What we are doing is trying to countermand meddling by politicians in the law.“It’s been Government elevating itself to an unacceptable level above the law, above our much-admired Supreme Court, and above the reputation internationally of the United Kingdom law.”Sunak’s press conference -the verdict from the commentariat and political reportersThursday 18 January 2024 12:21 , Joe Middleton Rishi Sunak’s press conference this morning to try and galvanize the Tory party before his controversial Rwanda proposals enter the House of Lords was not given a glowing endorsement by keen-eyed Westminster watchers.My colleague Zoë Grünewald described it as “self-indulgent” with “no new information”.This is a very self-indulgent press conference from Rishi Sunak. Absolutely no new information. No real answers about timings or why the public should support the Conservatives. "Plans working", he keeps telling us.
