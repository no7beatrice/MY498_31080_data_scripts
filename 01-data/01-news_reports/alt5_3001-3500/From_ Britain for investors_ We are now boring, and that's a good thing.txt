   From: Britain for investors: We are now boring, and that's a good thing. CE Noticias Financieras English October 4, 2023 Wednesday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

But for the first time in nearly a decade, after non-stop drama, from Brexit to Boris Johnson's colorful antics, politics in Britain is eliciting yawns rather than headlines. That's good news for the world's sixth-largest economy.      A year after a political and financial crisis sent the pound plummeting and ushered in the country's fifth prime minister in seven years, things calmed down under the leadership of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, allowing business investment to grow and finally surpass levels last seen before the 2016 vote to leave the European Union. The economy is stuck in very slow growth, but has so far avoided widespread expectations of recession and proved surprisingly resilient.      The U.K. economy received good news when the annual rate of consumer price inflation fell to 6.7% in August from 6.8% in July, defying expectations of a small increase and fueling hopes that the Bank of England may be close to ending its series of interest rate hikes.      Symbolic of this return to dull stability is Jeremy Hunt, the soft-spoken public money man who traveled a few days ago to the U.S. West Coast to meet with tech companies. His aim was to present Britain post-Brexit as a land of business-friendly regulation, a nation with the largest number of unicorn startups in Europe, a sizable financial center in London and world-class universities.      "I think it's about being nimble and reacting to change, but doing it in a predictable way," he said in an interview at his offices at 11 Downing Street. "That's the way you encourage the most investment."      There is nothing in the program to speed up pulses or address Britain's long-term problems such as its weak economic growth or flattening productivity, economists said. Hunt said Britain can afford neither huge tax cuts nor the subsidy bonanza that the United States and others are pursuing in the race for green technologies. He does not want public spending to drive economic growth while the Bank of England tries to contain inflation, which is at one of the highest rates in Europe.      Hunt said Britain is happy to sit back and have U.S. taxpayers dole out funds for clean energy technologies under U.S. President Joseph R. Biden's $369 billion Inflation Reduction Act because the money will accelerate the move toward zero carbon emissions and lower green technology prices for all, eventually boosting other economies. Britain sticks to a long-standing policy of subsidizing fixed-price contracts for electricity generated by renewable sources.      "I think the route we've gone down in the U.K. is a better route because it's less distortionary. And there's less gaming," he said.        While lacking ambition, this kind of unexciting vision is a relief for investors and businesses after years of uncertainty in British politics, said Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg, a bank. Corporate capital spending is, for now, back on its pre-2008 financial crisis trend, though that could prove temporary. "Hopefully, the rebound to the old trend may be a sign that the U.K.'s growth potential is recovering after six years of deterioration," he said.        Britain recently scored some big wins for its auto sector, with German automaker BMW pledging a 600 million pound investment, equivalent to $743 million, to produce electric versions of its Mini car, easing concerns that its plant in Oxford would close. That followed news of a £4 billion investment by Jaguar Land Rover owner Tata in a new electric car battery factory in Somerset, southwest England.      Multiple events in recent years spooked investors: concerns that Brexit would trigger a damaging trade war, worries about whether socialist Jeremy Corbyn could have been elected in 2019, the pandemic, Boris Johnson's scandal-hit prime minister and then war in Ukraine, an energy crisis and runaway inflation.      "The U.K. got a bit unlucky after Brexit in a series of crises," said John Springford, director of the Centre for European Reform in London. The country's economy has suffered permanent damage from the Brexit, which increased trade friction with the nation's largest trading partner, and the ensuing turmoil, but renewed business investment in recent quarters also shows that the U.K. is often underestimated, he said.       That series of multiple crises culminated a year ago, when Hunt was called in amid a frenzied sell-off in the pound triggered by the "mini-budget" program of then-Prime Minister Liz Truss, who proposed unfunded tax cuts and spending increases. The acting chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, was sacked and replaced by Hunt, a centrist Conservative who voted against Brexit. Hunt quickly raised taxes and cut spending, two moves typically guaranteed to make a finance minister unpopular. But the pound stabilized.      Other concerns slowly receded. Under Sunak, a 43-year-old former investment banker, Britain is mending fences with Europe rather than using it as a political punching bag. His government settled a long-running dispute over Northern Ireland's trade status and recently rejoined the bloc's Horizon scientific research program. Corbyn was ousted from the opposition Labour Party after it lost the 2019 election by a wide margin and was replaced by Keir Starmer, who advocates broadly centrist policies. Even the threat of a Scottish breakup of the union following a failed independence push in 2014 diminished as the Scottish National Party suffers from a scandal over its funding.      However, despite stabilizing the economy, many economists said neither Hunt nor Sunak have offered plans to address deeper problems, which include a crisis-hit state health system, crumbling infrastructure from schools to roads and a housing shortage that makes home ownership nearly impossible for many young workers. Polls suggest voters are likely to oust the ruling Conservative Party from power next fall, when the election is expected to usher in Labor for the first time since 2010.       "The problem we face is that there has rarely been a more urgent need, possibly never since the late 1970s, to address this country's economic problems," said National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a think tank, in an August report. "But at the same time, they have rarely been so entrenched that it is difficult to think of quick fixes that would materially improve living standards."       Despite the pickup in investment, "the economic upturn we expect is still quite weak compared with the G-7," said Alpesh Paleja, an economist at the Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby group.
