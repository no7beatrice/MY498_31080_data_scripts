   THE SUN SAYS Suella Braverman must force every chief constable to act on police watchdog’s ­withering report on failing, woke cops thesun.co.uk June 9, 2023 Friday 1:05 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS,OPINION,CONSERVATIVE PARTY,CRIME,METROPOLITAN POLICE,POLICE,SUN SAYS,THE SUN NEWSPAPER,UK POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 488 words Byline: The Sun Body                        Reform cops                                         EVERY word of the police watchdog’s ­withering attack on our failing, woke cops is music to our ears.                    But it is depressing the Chief Inspector of Constabulary , ex-Merseyside  boss Andy Cook , had to spell it out for them. For years forces nationwide , discombobulated by social media, have ignored the hard graft of preventing and detecting crime  to prioritise virtue-signalling stunts and politically contentious causes they personally support. Burglary  has effectively become legal while offending  against wokeness and trans rights  on Twitter  is punished.  No wonder public trust is at rock-bottom. “Police aren’t there to champion social change or take sides. They must uphold the law as it is written,” says Mr Cook. It won’t be fixed with “glossy strategies and mission statements”, he says, but “through action”. Dead right.  And the Home Secretary  will certainly agree.                      She must force every chief constable to listen and act — and fire them if they don’t.                                         Brexit bilge                                         THE Remainer establishment will waste no chance to trash Brexit.                     Incredibly, even the Covid inquiry  is limbering up to do so. It intends to ask witnesses how ­preparing to leave the EU  damaged our readiness for a pandemic.  Really? The scandalous incompetence and smug complacency of Public Health England  was Brexit’s fault? The years it wasted obsessing about our diets and baying for nanny state taxes were Brexit’s fault? PHE itself didn’t think Brexit was a problem when in February 2020 it assured the nation it was ready for anything (Spoiler: It wasn’t). What Brexit DID do was let us roll out the jabs  first.  We were still officially under EU rules — but went our own way because we knew we were leaving. Will the inquiry credit Brexit with saving countless lives?                       We won’t hold our breath.                                         Just stop him                                         IT is time Keir Starmer  denounced his major donor Dale Vince , and the criminal cult he also funds, and handed back every penny the tycoon has given Labour.                     The party is a contender for power. It cannot continue to be bankrolled and advised by a man who pays for, and now joins, Just Stop Oil’s  illegal roadblocks. It is absurd too for Vince to defend Starmer as being “his own man”. Starmer didn’t think up his deranged plan to ban vital new supplies of North Sea oil and gas. It is the sole demand of Just Stop Oil.  He is being steered by zealots like Ed Miliband  and Vince, who bunged the party £1.4million presumably hoping his economically illiterate ideology would become policy.  Hey presto, it did.                      Labour have become the puppets of fanatics waging war on the public.                    Load-Date: July 18, 2023  End of Document
