   Tories swing further to the right on immigration and climate change CE Noticias Financieras English September 29, 2023 Friday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

The Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, is now trying to send a message even further to the right with measures on climate change and immigration that divide even his own party.       Tim Bale, political scientist: "Brexit has accelerated the Conservative Party's shift to the radical populist right."          A few days ago, he announced that he was delaying or cancelling key measures already in place to reduce emissions and meet the UK's statutory target of cutting the most polluting gases, from transport and energy, as much as possible by 2050. Now it comes with an even more unexpected proposal: central government will take control to limit the ability of local councils to restrict traffic, vehicle speed or type, and to promote pedestrian zones, according to the Guardian.          As with the backtracking on the deadlines for ending the sale of the most polluting cars or boilers, Sunak is reversing the policies of his own party's governors. The measures to reduce emissions were approved by Boris Johnson, who continues to defend them. Johnson also supported low-emission zones, for which he gave public aid during the pandemic. But Sunak's switch is part of a campaign that ties in with messages being pushed by activists, talk show hosts and a few politicians, sometimes the same ones who pushed Brexit.          Sunak does not deny climate change or its seriousness and assures that the UK will be able to meet emissions reductions in any case, but he is courting more conservative voters who are more skeptical about concrete measures to reduce emissions.          He also suggests that he will cancel or delay work on the high-speed train to Manchester. He has not announced this officially, but on the eve of the annual congress in this northern English city he has refused to commit to the plan to keep it and has repeatedly spoken of the importance of fixing potholes in the roads.      Looking at the polls          Most Britons are concerned about climate change and are convinced it is due to human activity, in line with other major European countries. But when asked about specific measures that might affect them in their daily lives, respondents tend to be more reluctant to accept change, especially older and more conservative respondents.          55% of citizens believe that "policies to reduce carbon emissions only need to be implemented if they do not mean costs for ordinary people," according to a YouGov poll at the end of July. Forty-seven percent are against a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in 2030 (the delay of which Sunak has now announced) compared with 42% who support it; for those who voted Conservative in 2019, 68% are against the ban. A majority of Tory voters also oppose the retirement of the most polluting gas boilers.      Braverman's messages          While Sunak has defended that these are just tweaks to his climate policy, Home Secretary Suella Braverman has gone further and equated the timelines for the green transition to economic ruin. "We have to take a pragmatic and proportionate approach and that also serves our goals. We are not going to save the planet by bankrupting the British people," she said in an interview.          Braverman is the one who has carried the most extreme message on one of the issues that divides Britons and may play into the Conservative Party's hands: immigration. Braverman has been threatening for months that the United Kingdom would leave the UN refugee protection convention that the country helped found in 1951 to implement a controversial law that prohibits seeking asylum if one arrives in the country irregularly.          In a speech Tuesday at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington think-tank, Braverman said that being persecuted because of sexual orientation is not enough to be considered a refugee, contrary to one of the basic standards of international protection. "We're not going to be able to sustain an asylum system if, in fact, simply being gay or a woman and being afraid of discrimination in your home country is enough to be given protection," he said.          He even asserted that "in many cases" refugees pretend to be gay to receive help, that irregular immigration is "an existential challenge to the political and cultural institutions of the West" and the UN convention is obsolete.          In a statement, the UN refugee agency replied to Braverman by reminding him of the essential rules of international asylum: "The refugee convention remains as relevant today as when it was adopted. When individuals are at risk of persecution because of their sexual or gender orientation, it is crucial that they are able to seek safety and protection."          Conservative MPs later described their party colleague's speech as "scaremongering", "exaggerated" and a threat to the UK's international status.          The minister also said that "multiculturalism has failed" because it allows people to "live parallel lives" and not integrate into society. Braverman is the daughter of Indian immigrants who sought refuge first in Kenya and Mauritius and then, in the 1960s, in the United Kingdom. She was born in London and studied in Paris, first thanks to an Erasmus scholarship from the European Union. Braverman is also one of the great advocates of Brexit.          Asked by the BBC whether he agreed with Braverman, Sunak, also the son of immigrants, replied, "I think there is something incredible about this country, and that is a fantastic multicultural democracy."       Anti-immigration rhetoric          Anti-immigration messaging was key to the Brexit referendum win in 2016. Now, despite the increase in immigrants following the UK's exit from the EU, it is not perceived as a priority problem for the country among a majority of voters. Even so, there is a part of conservatives who can still mobilize with this message.          Looking at the general population, more Britons believe the U.K. should welcome persecuted people back home, but 25% of adults say the country should accept fewer or no people in these circumstances, according to pollster YouGov. Voters who supported the Conservatives in 2019 are the most enthusiastic about the government's measures to limit immigration.          The turn to the extreme right of the British Conservative Party in the case of immigration is already consolidated, as Tim Bale, professor of Politics at Queen Mary University of London, expert on the Tories and author of The Conservative Party After Brexit explained in an interview to elDiario.es in April: "If you look at the rhetoric and some of the policies, particularly on immigration, there is not much difference between the kind of language and the kind of solutions proposed by Rishi Sunak and the proposals of various radical right-wing populist parties across Europe. If a European party and country proposes to ban all asylum seekers, deem them illegal and send them to a distant African country, you would say that's a radical right-wing populist party rather than a mainstream center-right one," he explained. "In that particular respect, the Conservative Party has become a radical populist right-wing party."      Load-Date: September 30, 2023  End of Document
