   Brexit was huge act of self-harm; RECORD VIEW Daily Record and Sunday Mail June 23, 2023 Friday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Copyright © 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; TEASERS; Pg. 10 Length: 218 words Body   ALTHOUGH we have known for some time that Brexit has been harming Scotland, today we can put a number on it. But the £3billion we report is not just a figure on a page. It is hard cash that could have been spent on our public services every single year. That could have helped make the lives of Scottish people better. That's £3billion that could have gone towards the NHS, or schools. It is money that could have been used to fix roads or invest in public transport. Or it could have been used to create better facilities for young people, a cause close to the Record's heart. This week we have told of the many areas of Scottish life that have been adversely affected by the Tory Brexit. From labour shortages to the cost of exports, our departure from the single market and customs union has hit us hard in the pocket. The £3billion a year cost to the economy we report today is proof of how damaging Brexit has been, and it didn't need to happen. Brexit is the biggest act of self-harm in the history of the UK and it will take decades for the country to recover. The Tories caused it needlessly and must be punished at the ballot box for the chaos they have inflicted on the whole country. The next UK Government must improve its relationship with the EU to limit any further damage. £3BN LOST EVERY YEAR - PAGES 14&15 Load-Date: June 23, 2023  End of Document
