   George Galloway’s Rochdale win ‘beyond alarming’, says Sunak – as it happened thetimes.co.uk February 29, 2024 Thursday 10:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 9266 words Byline: Constance Kampfner | Peter Chappell | Joshua Thurston | Steven Swinford, Political Editor | Kieran Gair Highlight: Prime minister responded after by-election result Body   Rishi Sunak is giving a public address outside 10 Downing Street in the wake of George Galloway’s victory in Rochdale. It comes after Galloway swept to victory at the Rochdale by-election following one of the most divisive campaigns in years. Labour withdrew support for its candidate, Azhar Ali, after a recording emerged in which he claimed Israel was complicit in the terrorist attacks of October 7. The by-election was to decide the replacement for the veteran Labour MP, Sir Tony Lloyd, who died in January.  The Conservative Party must look at itself in relation to the “toxification of our public culture” which began during Brexit, a former culture minister has claimed. Lord Vaizey, who served under David Cameron’s government, said he hoped Rishi Sunak’s speech would signal a “new approach” for how politics is done. Speaking to Times Radio, he said: “The toxification of our public culture has happened in many different ways, and many in the Tory party should look to themselves, because the only time I felt frightened when I was an MP was how intense the Brexit debate got and how unpleasant the media was. “What I think has changed is what social media has done to our public discourse. It has made our public discourse more toxic, and it’s made our public discourse more toxic not just online, but in the real world.” Sunak’s announcement of a “robust new framework” to stop extremist organisations or individuals being “lent legitimacy” through working with government was already announced and implemented by the Home Office (Matthew Dathan, Home Affairs Editor, writes). Cutting links and funding with extremist groups was a key recommendation that the Home Office accepted after recommendations made by Sir William Shawcross as part of his review of Prevent, the government’s counterextremism programme, last year. Last week the Home Office said it had “completed” this work. Downing Street insisted that the prime minister’s announcement would go beyond what was committed to as part of the Prevent reforms. The government’s independent adviser on political violence and disruption has said the prime minister is right to draw attention to the “sense of intimidation” seen in recent protests (Laurence Sleator writes). Lord Walney, a former Labour MP, said the country needed a “reset moment” on how it could best protect elected representatives and promote a “genuine discussion of ideas”. Asked on Times Radio about Rishi Sunak’s address, he said: “I’m glad that the prime minister has spoken out. It’s a message that I have been giving the government and public for some time: that there is a sense of intimidation inherent in much of the aggressive protests that are happening around Gaza at the moment, and in the tactics that have been deployed on other issues in the recent past. “It is actually not about the free expression of views, it’s not about freedom of speech, it’s about using a sense of implied force and menace to get your way. It’s not acceptable.” George Galloway accused reporters of “crashing” his victory party after he was asked to respond to Rishi Sunak’s comments that “extremists” were seeking to undermine British democracy (Constance Kampfner writes). In a string of tense exchanges with the media, Galloway accused Sunak of staging a “melodramatic pantomime” with his speech outside Downing Street. Galloway laughed off comments from one journalist that some of his supporters were acting in an intimidating fashion by crowding around reporters, saying: “You’ve come to my victory party with your cameras, what do you mean you’re intimidated?” A journalist has been heckled and by shouted down by supporters of George Galloway with chants of “free Palestine” and “bye bye” (Laurence Sleator writes). Sam Coates had just conducted an interview with Galloway for Sky News in which he asked the new MP for Rochdale about allegations of intimidation by his supporters during the campaign. As the interview finished, Coates turned to the camera but Galloway supporters continued to try to interrupt him, blocking the camera and telling him to leave. The room then started a loud chant of “free free Palestine”, forcing the channel to go back to the studio. George Galloway has hit back at Rishi Sunak, saying the prime minister is in the “fag-end” of his premiership (Laurence Sleator writes). The newly elected MP for Rochdale was responding to Sunak’s speech outside 10 Downing Street, in which he called Galloway’s win “beyond alarming” and accused him of backing proscribed terrorist organisations. Speaking to Sky News, Galloway said: “I can understand how disappointed he is about the by-election: the Conservative Party was crushed not just by me but by an independent candidate no one had ever heard of before.” Asked before Sunak’s specific comments, Galloway told the interviewer: “You’re talking about him as if he’s God — we’re talking about little Rishi Sunak in the fag-end of his prime-minister-ship. Don’t talk to me as if he’s come down from the mound with tablets of stone. “Who won the election? Me or Rishi Sunak? Don’t put to me statements made by Rishi Sunak as if I’m supposed to be impressed by them. He don’t impress me much.“ If George Galloway wants the Rochdale by-election result to be about Gaza, Rishi Sunak used the Downing Street lectern — usually reserved for general elections and moments of national crisis — to seize control in the debate and bring it back to Britain. But both men’s remarks were aimed partly at Labour (Chris Smyth, Whitehall Editor, writes). The prime minister wants to use widespread horror at the election of the serial rabble-rouser to position himself as the defender of a British mainstream that sees getting on with the neighbours as far more important than a faraway conflict. On one level this is necessary: at a time when many Jews feel real fear and many Muslims deep anger, the country’s leader must try to draw the nation together. It is striking that to do so, for the second time in a week, Sunak has drawn attention to his own heritage as a “practicing Hindu and a proud Briton” to make this point. While Galloway’s critics argue that his politics are mostly about himself, Sunak has often been reluctant to draw attention to his own status as Britain’s first non-white prime minister. There is undeniable power in someone from his background standing in Downing Street to call the nation to “stand up for our shared values”. As always in politics though, there are other calculations in play. When Sunak earlier this week described himself as “living proof” that of Britain’s multi-ethnic success, it was in part to draw attention away from a row over remarks by the former Tory deputy chairman Lee Anderson that were widely seen as anti-Muslim. Similarly, by using his plea for unity to call for a crackdown on Gaza protests, Sunak is seeking both to unite his party and divide Labour. Many Tories agree with Anderson that the police have been soft on intimidatory and antisemitic behaviour by some protestors and the desire for a harder line is far safer territory for the prime minister. But for Sir Keir Starmer, the protests are far tougher ground, with many of his own MPs sympathising with their calls for a firmer line on Gaza. By casting many of the protestors as “hostile to our values”, Sunak seeks to either taint Starmer or make him disown those who might otherwise back Labour: “There must be leadership, not pandering or appeasement.” With time running out to an election and the Conservatives so far behind, this is an understandable political tactic. But by using an appeal for unity to take a swipe at a “divisive, hateful ideological agenda”, there is a risk that Sunak deepens the rift he says he wants to heal. Sunak has called on police to “draw a line” on Gaza demonstrations, saying they must not “merely manage these protests, but police them”. “Yes, you can march and protest with passion. You can demand the protection of civilian life but no, you cannot call for violent jihad,” he said. “There is no ‘context’ in which it can be acceptable to beam antisemitic tropes on to Big Ben in the middle of a vote on Israel-Gaza. “And there’s no cause you can use to justify the support of proscribed terrorist groups, such as Hamas.” He pledged that the government would back the police when it took action and that the government would do more. He said ministers would “redouble support” for the Prevent programme and “demand that universities stop extremist activity on campus”. He added: “We will also act to prevent people entering this country whose aim is to undermine our values. The home secretary has instructed that if those here on visas choose to spew hate on protests or seek to intimidate people we will remove their right to be here.” Sunak has claimed that Islamist extremists and the far right are feeding off and emboldening each other and are “two sides of the same extremist coin”. “Both want to set Briton against Briton to weaponise the evils of antisemitism and anti-Muslim hatred for their own ends,” he said. He warned that their agenda was to make the public blame the UK “for the world’s ills” and “accept a moral equivalence between Britain and some of the most despicable regimes in the world”. “When these groups claim that Britain is and has been on the wrong side of history, we should reject it, and reject it again.” He warned that this would have a corrosive effect on community relations and the future of multicultural society. “When these groups tell children that they cannot and will not succeed because of who they are, when they tell children that the system is rigged against them or that Britain is a racist country, this is not only a lie, but a cynical attempt to crush young dreams, and turn impressionistic minds against their own society,” he said. “I stand here as our country’s first non-white prime minister to tell people of all races, all faiths and all backgrounds it is not the colour of your skin, the god you believe in or where you were born, that will determine your success but just your own hard work and endeavour.” Rishi Sunak warned that the UK’s “great achievement” of building the world’s most “successful multi-ethnic, multi-faith democracy” was being “deliberately undermined” by “forces here at home trying to tear us apart”. He said: “Since October 7, there have been those trying to take advantage of the very human angst that we all feel about the terrible suffering that war brings to the innocent, to women and children to advance a divisive, hateful ideological agenda. “I need to speak to you all this evening because this situation has gone on long enough and demands a response not just from government, but from all of us.” The election of George Galloway is “beyond alarming”, Rishi Sunak has said, warning it “demands a response” not just from the government but “from all of us”. In an address from Downing Street, the prime minister said the conflict in Gaza had led to a “shocking increase” in “intimidation, threats and planned acts of violence” on Britain’s streets. George’s Galloway’s by-election victory is terrible news for Labour, but not in the way the new MP for Rochdale might hope (Chris Smyth, Whitehall Editor, writes). Party sources are privately dismissive of the suggestion that his Gaza-fuelled campaign will win any seats in the general election and predict that Galloway himself will “crawl back under his stone soon enough”. Labour’s current poll lead is big enough that even a Rochdale-style collapse in support among Muslim voters will not cost them any seats. The electorate in Galloway’s new constituency is 30 per cent Muslim, putting it 18th on a list topped by three seats with a majority-Muslim electorate: Birmingham Hodge Hill, Birmingham Hall Green and Bradford West — the last represented by Galloway between 2012 and 2015. All of these constituencies have enormous Labour majorities, and analysis by The Times has found that even losing thousands of Muslim voters will not cost Starmer any seats. The swing seats that will decide the election have far smaller Muslim populations, and it will take a dramatic collapse in Labour support for such voters to significantly affect the election result. Indeed, the fall in Labour Muslim support is symptomatic of a key Starmer success: Labour’s support is becoming much more electorally efficient. Seat-by-seat polling suggests Labour’s vote share is down in seats it already holds — up to 20 per cent in the safest constituencies — but is up in the Tory-held places it needs to win. Yet, as with much of Labour’s campaign strategy, there is real anxiety in the party that what may help them win the election will store up problems when they take power. Labour MPs who worried about losing their seats at the start of the Gaza conflict are now much more confident, but a lot more concerned about community relations in their constituencies after months of acrimonious debate on the Middle East. For the next few months, Galloway will have the opportunity to deepen those divisions in what some in Labour think could lead to “irreparable” damage to the social fabric and make their post-election task much harder. How Starmer handles Galloway-fuelled tensions over the coming months may also offer a foretaste of how he will deal with the regular crises he will be faced with in Downing Street. As one Labour source puts it of the party’s struggle to reach a position on Gaza, “this is what it will be like when we are in government, all the time”. The victory of George Galloway in Rochdale was bolstered by vote-rigging, the candidate for Reform UK has suggested, without providing any evidence of voting irregularities to support the provocative claim (Kieran Gair writes). Simon Danczuk, who stood for Reform UK, suggested the by-election had been affected by the “harvesting of postal votes”. Danczuk won Rochdale for Labour in the 2010 and 2015 general elections but was  suspended by the party  for sending explicit messages to a 17-year-old girl. In seeking to cast doubt over the legitimacy of Galloway’s victory on Friday, Danczuk told Times Radio: “I’m not the only politician who is aware of the harvesting of postal votes. Now, if the Electoral Commission hasn’t been able to commission some research that shows that, rest assured that it does happen. “And I’m not the only politician to say this. I’ve been around politics 35 years. There is no doubt that people, particularly in the Muslim community, but not exclusively, followed the postal workers around, knocking on the doors of households and then harvesting the postal votes from families. That is just the well-known fact in key areas like this.” Asked repeatedly to provide evidence supporting his claim of postal vote fraud, Danczuk was unable to do so. He said: “They will knock on the door and oversee the completion of postal votes, and then they will collect [them] … I suspect there will be some intimidation. I suspect that some will have been completed by people who, not the person that the ballot paper was sent to.” Richard Tice, the Reform leader, had earlier claimed that the by-election was not “free and fair”. Danczuk, he said, had been “subjected to death threats” and had “suffered vile racist abuse” during the campaign. Galloway has denied his supporters engaged in any intimidation. He told Sky News that Tice had even invited him to be a Reform UK candidate in the by-election. The Electoral Commission has said the UK has “low levels of proven electoral fraud”, with 93 per cent of complaints registered in 2022 not resulting in police action. James Giles, Galloway’s campaign manager, said: “I don’t think it’s worth dignifying with a response, other than saying that that is a gross insult to the hard work of Steve Rumbelow, the returning officer, and all of the election team who have worked tirelessly to deliver this election in Rochdale. If he has any specific allegations, then he must immediately report them to the police.” Labour has “let the people of Rochdale down”, the mayor of Greater Manchester has said, as he vowed to promote “cohesion” following George Galloway’s by-election victory (Kieran Gair writes).  Andy Burnham said: “Labour has let the people of Rochdale down because it didn’t give them a good enough choice at the election held yesterday. “It’s right that the leader of the party has apologised to the people of Rochdale but we will now work with him and his team to make sure there is some reflection on what has happened, some honesty, so that we can all come together and work together to regain the trust of the people of Rochdale.” He continued: “We have a large Muslim community but the biggest Jewish community outside of London, and the leaders of both of those communities work together, and we pride ourselves on the cohesion between the different communities in Greater Manchester.  “We will work with anybody who seeks to promote that cohesion, but we will stand up to anybody who seeks to bring division or hate to our city region.” George Galloway is to be introduced by Jeremy Corbyn and David Davis when he takes his seat in the Commons next week, according to Sky News (Kieran Gair writes).  After the 2019 election and Corbyn’s landslide defeat, Galloway founded his current movement, the Workers Party of Britain, to champion left-wing populism.  He remained a staunch Corbyn ally, however, and used his victory in Rochdale to attack Sir Keir Starmer, Corbyn’s successor.  Galloway has previously shared a platform with David Davis, the Conservative former Brexit secretary, when they appeared together on the Kremlin-funded TV station RT in 2013.  The new MP for Rochdale was previously paid £1,600 a week for hosting the two-hour chatshow                     Sputnik                    :                     Orbiting the World with George Galloway                     on RT. Galloway also advocated for a Brexit vote in the EU referendum.  The maverick MP is planning to speak in the budget debate on Wednesday, Sky News reported. MPs resisted congratulating George Galloway on Friday as both Labour and the Conservatives struggled to come to terms with a dramatic collapse in support (Kieran Gair writes).  Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, was one of the few MPs to publicly congratulate the new member for Rochdale on Friday. Speaking at the Convention of the North event in Leeds, Gove said: “You have got to respect a democratic vote, so I congratulate George Galloway on his victory, but I am fundamentally opposed to the platform on which George Galloway stood. “I think that he is fostering a politics of division when we need to come together. I think that his position on the Middle East, the approach that he has taken towards that conflict, is not going to contribute to peace in the Middle East and is certainly not going to contribute towards reconciliation, bridge-building and countering prejudice here in the UK. “So, it’s a regrettable moment and it only reinforces the government’s determination to counter extremism and build cohesion.” Earlier, Ellie Reeves, Labour’s deputy national campaign co-ordinator, laughed when she was asked if she would like to congratulate Galloway. She told Sky News: “I think we’ll leave it there.” The leftwing populist said he found it “difficult to grasp why [Gaza is] seen as a bad thing to be concerned about” (Constance Kampfner writes). “If this was February 1940, would you be putting to me as an accusation that I have been highlighting the Holocaust?” he asked. “If the answer to that is no, then why does it become an accusation when someone is highlighting what the ICJ [International Court of Justice] calls a plausible case of genocide?” Galloway, who will be sworn in on Monday, said he planned to use his first appearance in parliament at PMQs on Wednesday to “raise the issue of Gaza” before turning to “the economic and social problems here in Rochdale” in the budget debate. The former Celebrity Big Brother contestant said he did not plan to be thorn in Keir Starmer’s side but “more a short sword in his backside — that’s what I want to be”. George Galloway has insisted he would rather focus on local issues than international politics, hours after winning a by-election dominated by the war in Gaza (Constance Kampfner writes). Speaking to The Times in his hotel lobby on Friday morning, a bleary-eyed Galloway responded to criticism that he had parachuted into Rochdale to capitalise on the rift between Labour and Muslim community by claiming that he was actually “trying to get out of foreign affairs”. “It’s like the Steve Van Zandt character in The Sopranos, they keep pulling me back in. I’ve been trying for years to get out,” said the new Workers Party of Britain MP. “I want to talk about British domestic politics because I think Britain is literally going to the dogs and if we don’t pull out of this nosedive, we’re in very serious trouble. But every year, a new war erupts, a new atrocity occurs. And hey ho you’re back right in the thick of it.” He added: “So you can believe it or not, but it’s honestly true that I would much prefer to be speaking about the future of the steel industry in Port Talbot than about the latest massacre on the Gaza Strip. As soon as I get the opportunity to do that, the happier I’ll be.” The Rochdale by-election was “one of the most divisive in recent times”, Rishi Sunak has said (Peter Chappell writes). Speaking in Montrose, Angus, he was asked if George Galloway’s election win would inflame tensions. “It was very concerning to see the reports of intimidation through the by-election, and by all accounts one of the most divisive campaigns that we’ve seen in recent times,” the prime minister said. “I’m pleased the Conservative Party was the only party to run a really positive campaign focused on local issues with a great local candidate, Paul Ellison.” He is due to attend the Scottish Conservative conference later on Friday. George Galloway only secured victory in Rochdale because Labour did not put up a candidate, Sir Keir Starmer has said, as he attempted to play down the political maverick’s win (Kieran Gair writes). The Labour leader apologised to voters in the Greater Manchester constituency but denied he was to blame for Galloway’s return to the Commons.  Starmer said: “Galloway only won because Labour didn’t stand a candidate. I regret that we had to withdraw our candidate, I apologise to voters in Rochdale, but I took that decision — it was the right decision — and when I say I’ve changed the Labour Party, I mean it.  “Obviously, we will put a first class candidate, a unifier before the voters in Rochdale at the general election.”  Asked about the role of the Israel-Gaza war in the by-election result, Sir Keir called for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire to ensure hostages can get out” of the besieged territory Gaza.  George Galloway secured victory by frightening voters with “inflammatory” language aimed at causing division, a former defence minister has said (Kieran Gair writes). Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP, said the literature produced by Galloway’s team in the lead-up to the by-election was “designed to rally fear”. He told Sky News: “This was a chaotic by-election. It’s taking place when temperatures are already raised very, very high.” Ellwood said the contest should have been an “easy win for Labour”. He added: “I read some of his literature — they are so full of hate. They are designed to rally fear, they are designed to cause division.”  Ellwood concluded: “This was a very, very horrible by-election to watch.” George Galloway’s victory in Rochdale has sparked widespread condemnation from Jewish organisations (Kieran Gair writes).  The Jewish Representative Council of Greater Manchester & Region (JRC) warned the new MP was likely to endanger “community cohesion”. Its statement read: “Galloway has a history of divisive rhetoric and associations with people who hold controversial views. At a time of heightened tension, toxic public discourse and instability, further populist speech will create anxiety for Jewish people who are already contending with record levels of hate crime.”  The statement continued: “Community cohesion is coming under unprecedented pressure. It is now more important than ever that people concentrate on building bridges by ensuring a conflict taking place thousands of miles away is not used as an excuse to target Jewish people across the region. “We have no doubt, given his extensive record of contentious behaviour, that George Galloway will hinder rather than help with this critically important work.” The contest in Rochdale was not just about Gaza. While Galloway’s message on the Israel-Hamas war rang loudest, he also campaigned on several local issues (Kieran Gair writes). In a nod to Donald Trump, Galloway promised to “make Rochdale great again” as he pledged to turn around the town’s fortunes. It was a campaign that focused on its deprivation, the lack of a maternity hospital and the dire financial position of the town’s football club. In a community with no A&E or maternity unit, Galloway said: “No new Rochdalians will ever be born here unless I can get the A&E back.” Included among Galloway’s other promises were commitments to crack down on grooming gangs and pledges to reopen boarded-up shops. The victory of George Galloway marks a “dark day” in British politics, the Board of Deputies of British Jews has said (Kieran Gair writes).  Responding to Galloway’s electoral triumph on Friday, the group said: “George Galloway is a demagogue and conspiracy theorist who has brought the politics of division and hate to every place he has ever stood for parliament. His election is a dark day for the Jewish community in this country, and for British politics in general.  “We believe he should be shunned as a pariah by all parliamentarians.”  Several Jewish organisations have reacted with dismay at Galloway’s victory. The Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) said it is “extremely concerned” over how Galloway will use his platform.  Asked if Galloway would serve Jewish people effectively, Chris Williamson, a former Labour MP who is now deputy leader of the Workers Party party, told Times Radio: “Of course he will. Absolutely. And I know the point you’re trying to get out there, but the difficulty is for you is that you are conflating Jewish people with Zionism.”  Galloway has denied he is racist or antisemitic. The most successful parliamentary disruptor in Britain has now won seats in five constituencies, ranging from the west coast of Scotland to the East End of London and on both sides of the Pennines. By contrast, Nigel Farage, the country’s other main populist, has never won a seat in the Commons. The spectacular victory of the new honourable member for Rochdale, George Galloway MP, gives a first Commons seat to his fledgling Workers Party of Britain — although nobody expects them to pick up another. Galloway is the only act on this playbill. It is a remarkable turn of events after he looked washed up and defeated in 2011 when his Respect Party polled just 6,972 votes and came 13th in the Scottish parliament elections, winning no seats. The return of George Galloway, indefatigable political survivor Labour voters in Rochdale were “all too willing to jump ship” in the by-election but the “electoral gloom” hanging over the Conservative Party shows no sign of lifting, Sir John Curtice has said (Kieran Gair writes).  Curtice, regarded as the UK’s foremost polling expert, said the by-election result could push Sir Keir Starmer to adopt a more critical stance on Israel’s action in Gaza as Labour seeks to thwart any further traction by George Galloway.  He wrote: “It [Rochdale] represents Labour’s worst ever performance in a post-war by-election, outstripping even the 37.5 point fall suffered by Peter Tatchell, the gay rights campaigner, in Bermondsey in 1983.”  What George Galloway’s by-election win means for Labour and the Tories Separately, Curtice told BBC Breakfast: “So far as Mr Sunak is concerned, well frankly, here is another poor Conservative performance. Conservative vote down by 19 points. It is the biggest drop in the Conservative vote in a Labour-held seat in a by-election this parliament.” Labour must treat the electoral threat posed by the Workers Party of Britain “incredibly seriously”, a former adviser to Sir Tony Blair has said (Kieran Gair writes).  John McTernan, who was Blair’s political secretary in No 10, said George Galloway’s victory in the Rochdale contest should serve as a warning to Sir Keir Starmer.  McTernan told                     Today                     on BBC Radio 4 that the Rochdale result could be seen as a partial judgment on parliament’s handling of the Gaza ceasefire issue.  McTernan said: “The issue though is this was a judgment in some way on last week’s parliament, the lack of the ability of the UK parliament to come to a position that most people in Britain believe about Israel-Gaza, that there should be an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian ceasefire.” The deputy leader of George Galloway’s party has refused to condemn the October 7 Hamas terror attacks on Israel (Steven Swinford writes). Chris Williamson, a former Labour MP who is now deputy leader of the Workers Party, told the BBC Radio 4                     Today                     that Galloway’s by-election victory would “send shockwaves through the corridors of power”. Asked whether he would condemn the October 7 attacks, Williamson said: “You can’t expect to live in a situation where people have been oppressed for 75 years and not expect a reaction. What about the Palestinian people that have been massacred? Where is the media outrage at that? In international law oppressed people have an absolute right to armed resistance.”  He declined to distance himself or the party from Nick Griffin, the former leader of the BNP, who gave Galloway his support during the by-election campaign. “You’re trying to damn the workers party and George Galloway by association,” he said. Asked about Galloway’s claims about the Quran in a separate interview with Times Radio, Ellie Reeves, Labour’s deputy national campaign co-ordinator, said: “Obviously, Labour councillors shouldn’t be campaigning for someone that isn’t a Labour candidate.  “And I thought Ali wasn’t a Labour candidate but that’s the first I’m hearing about these allegations.” Reeves added: “I’m sure that we will look at that [Galloway’s claims]. But as I say, I don’t know what these allegations are, what these reports are, what evidence there is for it.” George Galloway has accused Labour councillors of asking voters in Rochdale to “swear on the Quran” that they would support the party’s suspended candidate Azhar Ali (Kieran Gair writes). The leader of the Workers Party of Britain made the extraordinary claim in an interview with Times Radio on Friday. After triumphing over Ali in the Rochdale by-election, Galloway said: “The Labour councillors were all campaigning for him [Ali] in breach of Starmer’s supposed injunction. “This is a criminal offence I’m about to allege, including councillors bringing a Quran into people’s houses and asking the voters to swear on the Quran that they would support the Labour candidate, something which without doubt could lead to imprisonment.” Galloway continued: “It’s not really true that they [Labour] withdrew their candidate. But I’ll grant you, of course, it was exceptional circumstances, but we got 10,000 votes more than their candidate, and Labour didn’t even come remotely second.” Sir Keir Starmer has “woken up to his worst nightmare”, George Galloway has declared, as he continued to revel in his victory over Labour, (Kieran Gair writes). Galloway said his Workers Party of Britain will stand candidates in dozens of Labour-held constituencies at the general election and will “either defeat them ourselves or cause their defeat”. Asked if he believed his party could replicate his Rochdale success in other seats, Galloway told GB News: “We have got 59 parliamentary candidates ready to go and we will stand in therefore three score Labour seats and either defeat them ourselves or cause their defeat and there will be independents, not Workers Party, but independents that we are ready to support who will stand up and down the country and I know of many already in the field who will now be energised by the result here tonight.” He added: “I think Keir Starmer has woken up this morning to his worst nightmare.” Labour will not change its position on Gaza despite the thumping victory of George Galloway in the Rochdale by-election, the party’s deputy national campaign co-ordinator has said, (Kieran Gair writes). As criticism of the party’s handling of the by-election intensified on Friday morning, Ellie Reeves told Sky News: “We’ve set out our position on Gaza and that was adopted by the Commons just the other week.  “We’ve said there should be an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, that the loss of life has been intolerable, there must be no ground offensive in Rafah, aid has to be ramped up into the region, and, importantly, that we need to find a two-state solution.  “That shouldn’t just be sort of empty words by politicians, but a political reality rather than an aspiration. A Labour government would work tirelessly to make sure that happens.”  While conceding Sir Keir Starmer could “pay a high price” for his stance on the conflict, she said the party had “set out our position”.  Labour’s by-election defeat in Rochdale was “self-inflicted”, a key left-wing pressure group has said, as it sought to capitalise on the loss to accuse Sir Keir Starmer of “factional abuse”, (Kieran Gair writes). Momentum, the grassroots group which emerged from Jeremy Corbyn’s 2015 leadership campaign, was quick to blame the chaos surrounding the Rochdale contest on Starmer’s leadership.  A spokesman said: “This was a needless and self-inflicted loss for Labour. First, Starmer’s utterly factional selection processes resulted in a candidate who was clearly unfit for office. Then the Labour leadership tried to defend him as one of their own.  “Finally, Keir Starmer’s failure to stand with Gaza in its hour of need left the door open for George Galloway.  “To avoid any more damaging repeats, Starmer should end the factional abuse of Labour’s selection processes and stand up for an immediate, permanent ceasefire in Gaza.” Momentum, which requires supporters to be members of Labour, played a key role in consolidating Corbyn’s grip on the Labour machine but is viewed with suspicion by moderate MPs who consider it a drag anchor on Starmer’s shift to the centre ground. In a rough night for the two major parties, second place was won by a local businessman, David Tully, who stood as an independent, (Joshua Thurston writes). Tully, who only began his political career four weeks ago, secured 6,638 votes. The runner-up ran his campaign primarily on local issues, including social housing and the reinstatement of the town’s maternity ward, with “no allegiance to any of the parties or any political views or opinions”. The former rugby player and Rochdale FC season-ticket holder made the National League side’s finances — the club is under threat of liquidation — a significant focus of his campaign and pledged to support local sports clubs.  Labour has apologised to the people of Rochdale for being unable to field a candidate (writes Joshua Thurston). “George Galloway only won because Labour did not stand,” a party spokesman said. “Rochdale deserved the chance to vote for an MP that would bring communities together and deliver for working people. The spokesman said the party will “quickly” select a new candidate that represents the constituency and offers the “fresh start that Rochdale deserves” for the upcoming general election. “George Galloway is only interested in stoking fear and division. As an MP he will be a damaging force in our communities and public life,” the spokesman commented. Labour disowned and suspended Azhar Ali, who won the contest to be Labour’s candidate, for alleged antisemitic remarks. George Galloway’s victory in Rochdale represents the worst possible result for Labour (Steven Swinford writes) The pro-Palestinian campaigner now has a parliamentary platform from which to exploit Labour’s divisions on Gaza just months ahead of the general election. Acknowledged even by his opponents as a powerful orator and campaigner, Galloway plans to use Rochdale as a launch pad for his Workers Party of Britain and its Corbynite agenda to challenge Starmer from the left. As Galloway put it in the early hours of this morning: “Labour is on notice that they have lost the confidence of millions of their voters who loyally and traditionally voted for them generation after generation.” The challenge for Labour is not so much an electoral one — Galloway’s party has relatively little chance of winning more seats — but one of party management. His victory will cause significant problems and tensions for Labour at a local level, particularly in seats with large Muslim communities. Many Labour MPs still have the scars from Galloway’s two previous by-election victories in Bethnal Green, and Bradford are dreading the prospect of his return to the frontline. Senior Labour figures argue that the threat posed by Galloway is overstated. An analysis of polling suggests that Labour’s lead in the polls is so big it is likely to survive any decline in Muslim support and would be denied victory in only a handful of Tory-held constituencies. But as the election approaches Galloway will ignite tensions and will relentlessly target Starmer. During the by-election campaign, he vowed to “topple the hated Labour leader”.  And while Galloway’s ambition may be over-stated, it is a challenge that the Labour leader could well do without. George Galloway has “an atrocious record of baiting the Jewish community”, the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) has said in a statement responding to his by-election victory (Joshua Thurston writes). The charity said it is “extremely concerned” over how Galloway will use his platform. “Given his historic inflammatory rhetoric and the current situation faced by the Jewish community in this country, we are extremely concerned by how he may use the platform of the House of Commons in the remaining months of this parliament.” The CAA stressed several remarks made by Galloway during his career, including in a speech in 2014 when he described his then constituency of Bradford as an “Israel-free zone”. Galloway has denied suggestions he is antisemitic. At 3.30am there was a mad scramble through rows of George Galloway supporters lined up outside Rochdale Leisure Centre to get to the newly elected MP’s campaign HQ — a second-hand car dealership on the outskirts of town (Constance Kampfner writes). Flanked by polished Mercedes and Hondas, the political agitator raised his fist in the air and delivered his second speech of the night. “We crushed Labour by 10,000 votes,” he declared. “This is the first time in British political history that a by-election has taken place and both major parties in the country were completely crushed.” It was, he said, the start not only of a “Rochdale revival” but the beginning of a new movement that would shake up British politics. Promising to field 59 candidates for his Workers Party of Britain in the general election, Galloway encouraged independents in the northwest, the West Midlands, Birmingham and east London to “stand up and fight” by joining his campaign. Asked by reporters to respond to criticism that he was just “using” Rochdale to propel his return to politics, Galloway said that he planned to represent the constituency for five years before bowing out, adding that though he might not look it, he was nearing 70. He also used the victory rally to claim that Richard Tice, the leader of Reform UK, had tried to convince him to stand for his party.  Asked to respond to Tice’s claims that his candidate suffered intimidation during the campaign, Galloway insisted none of his volunteers had engaged in bad behaviour. He told Times Radio: “I think Mr Tice has rather lost his balance, and Mr Farage too, and I remind Mr Tice that I have on my telephone a text from him inviting me to be the Reform UK candidate in a by-election not that long ago. “I’d prefer not to publish it, but if he keeps telling lies about me I will have to tell the truth about him.” George Galloway has said his victory means that “Labour is on notice that they have lost the confidence of millions of their voters who loyally and traditionally voted for them generation after generation” (Constance Kampfner writes from Rochdale). He said: “Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak are two cheeks of the same backside and they both got well and truly spanked tonight here in Rochdale.” His speech was interrupted by a protester who accused the populist of being “a climate change denier”. “You said in the hustings that you wanted to extract oil and gas from the North Sea,” she shouted, before she was escorted out of the building. Undeterred, Galloway turned briefly to local issues, citing the lack of maternity services in the town and the beleaguered Rochdale AFC. He pledged to build a “grand alliance” to “clean up” the council, inviting the night’s shock runner-up David Tully to join it. Tully, an independent, gained 6,638 votes after deciding to join the race at the 11th hour. The Rochdale business-owner told The Times he was “not political one bit” and had voted in only one previous election, but took one look at the by-election ballot sheet and decided that “the town needed a voice”. “That’s why I stood up,” he said. “I just want to help the community I live in to the best of my ability, because I feel it’s been overshadowed and got a lot of bad press.” Candidates representing, or formerly representing, traditional parties did not fare well. In third place was the Conservatives’ Paul Simon Ellison with 3,731 votes, while Azhar Ali, the former Labour candidate, who skipped the results, came fourth with 2,402. George Galloway has stormed his way to victory in Rochdale after a campaign focused less on the town itself than on a conflict happening more than 2,000 miles away while Keir Starmer’s disowned candidate finished a distant fourth place (Constance Kampfner writes from Rochdale).  The former Labour MP turned political renegade won with 12,335 votes, and a majority of about 6,000, after dubbing himself “Gaza George Galloway” and sticking up posters of himself all over town against the red, black, white and green Palestinian flag.  The leftwing firebrand concentrated his campaign on the Middle East in an attempt to win backing from Rochdale’s significant Muslim voters, who make up just under a third of the population.  He was given a boost after Labour’s candidate, Azhar Ali, was disowned by the party over remarks widely alleged to be antisemitic. It was too late to replace him on the ballot. Sporting his trademark fedora, Galloway, 69, said: “This is for Gaza.” He said that Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, would “pay a high price for the role that [he] played in enabling, encouraging and covering for the catastrophe presently going on in occupied Palestine and in the Gaza Strip”. It is not the first time Galloway has caused a by-election upset since being kicked out of the Labour Party in 2003 for remarks he made about the Iraq war.  In 2005 he got his revenge by seizing Bethnal Green in east London from his old party. After losing the seat in 2010 he returned to parliament again in 2012 when he won the Bradford West by-election. Galloway, who stood for the Workers Party of Britain in Rochdale, will now enter parliament again where he hopes to become a permanent thorn in Starmer’s side.  Billy Howarth, an independent candidate, said he agreed with Richard Tice, the leader of the Reform Party, that there had been an “element of intimidation” running through the election campaign in Rochdale. Howarth, a well-known local campaigner, said he was abused by a man carrying a Palestinian flag on Thursday in Rochdale town centre who, after seeing his rosette, called him “a dirty Zionist bastard”, he said. The man was arrested by police, he added. Howarth co-founded the group Parents Against Grooming UK and has pushed for better housing for people suffering with damp and mould.  However, David Tully, another independent, said he did not experience or witness any intimidation “at all”. Tully is expected to finish second after George Galloway. George Galloway’s campaign team are predicting a comfortable win for their Workers Party of Britain candidate. Chris Williamson, a former Labour MP who is deputy leader of the party, told Sky News: “We believe that we’ve won comfortably today and it really will, I think, send shockwaves through the Palace of Westminster.” He added that a victory for Galloway represented “a total rejection of mainstream party politics”. On a visit to the constituency The Times found the left-wing populist revelling in Labour’s antisemitism crisis over its suspended candidate Azhar Ali. Is George Galloway set to win the Rochdale by-election? ‘Gaza George’ Galloway becomes Rochdale by-election frontrunner Richard Tice, leader of the Reform Party, said that the poll in Rochdale had “not been a free and fair election”, as he declared George Galloway as the winner. “Unfortunately the behaviour of certain candidates and supporters means this has fallen well below our tradition,” he said at the election count as his party’s candidate, Simon Danczuk, stood silently next to him. “What we witnessed here is deeply disturbing. Our candidate and campaign team have been subjected to death threats, vile racist abuse, been refused entry to hustings in council buildings and had to be relocated for their own safety. “They have suffered daily intimidation and slurs.” Tice said that he was concerned about the “extraordinary increase in the size of the postal vote, from 14,000 to some 23,000 in the space of just four years”. He added: “This by-election and result should act as a serious wake-up call to those in power and indeed to the entire electorate. “We are supposed to be a beacon of democracy, this shameful contest has been more characteristic of a failed state. Unless something dramatic changes, our fear is, this will be repeated in dozens of constituencies across the UK at the general election. And by Christmas we face the prospect of numerous extremist, antisemitic law-makers in the House of Commons.” Tice said that Galloway had won by a significant margin but that his victory was irrelevant. He added: “What’s really relevant is the implications for democracy in the United Kingdom.” Times Radio visited Rochdale to find out how much influence the  Israel-Hamas war  was having on the electorate. The lack of a Labour candidate means the by-election will bring to an end a run of victories for Sir  Keir Starmer , while the reason for Azhar Ali’s suspension will reignite a fight in the Labour Party over antisemitism.  If George Galloway wins, many in Labour fear that he could act as a lightening rod for Muslim voters who are drawn to his position on the Gaza conflict. Turnout in the Rochdale by-election has just been announced as 39.7 per cent (Constance Kampfner writes from Rochdale). Almost 83,000 people were eligible to vote. This is slightly higher than the most recent two by-elections in Wellingborough in Northamptonshire, where it was 38 per cent, and Kingswood, near Bristol, where it was 37.1 per cent. Labour won both those seats from the Conservatives. Meanwhile it has been reported that Labour’s suspended candidate, Azhar Ali, might not turn up to the count at Rochdale Leisure Centre at all. There is plenty of chatter among activists that George Galloway is on his way to a landslide victory. But another, less familiar, name that keeps rearing its head is that of David Tully (Constance Kampfner writes from Rochdale). Observers at the Rochdale count believe this independent candidate could be in with a good chance at second place, in what would mark a definitive rejection of mainstream politics in this former mill town, which has been held by Labour since 2010. A friend of Tully’s for four decades told me he makes no secret of the fact that he is “not a political person”. The vehicle repair shop owner and Rochdale native instead “just wants what’s best for the town”, the friend said. Tully apparently decided to throw his hat in the ring just one day before the deadline for applications, after concluding that candidates such as Galloway were more concerned by what was happening thousands of miles away than in Rochdale itself. A well-known face about town, Tully has run on a ticket promising to bring back Rochdale’s maternity ward and support local businesses. The former rugby player has also pledged to support local sports clubs and the ailing Rochdale AFC. Labour’s candidate lost the support of the party after a recording from a community meeting last year, in which he made remarks condemned as antisemitic, was leaked. Labour originally stood by Azhar Ali after he apologised for the first comments, in which he suggested Israel had allowed the October 7 attack by Hamas to go ahead as a pretext to move into Gaza. However, after a second part of the recording was released, in which he blamed “people in the media from certain Jewish quarters” for the suspension of the MP Andy McDonald from the party, Labour  dropped its support and suspended Ali . Because the deadline to nominate candidates had passed by the time Labour had made the decision, it was too late to select someone else to stand for the party and Ali still appeared as a Labour candidate on the ballot paper. Ali’s comments helped propel George Galloway’s bid for election. How did Azhar Ali go from Jewish ally to antisemitism storm? There are 11 candidates vying for the Rochdale seat. They are:  Azhar Ali, on the ballot as a Labour candidate  Mark Coleman, Independent  Simon Danczuk, Reform UK  Iain Donaldson, Liberal Democrat  Paul Ellison, Conservative  George Galloway, Workers Party of GB  Michael Howarth, Independent  William Howarth, Independent  Guy Otten, on the ballot as a Green candidate, but did not campaign  Ravin Rodent Subortna, Official Monster Raving Loony Party  David Tully, Independent Read more about the candidates A confident George Galloway, the bookies’ favourite to win tonight’s election, has promised to be an MP for “all Rochdalians” if voted in (Constance Kampfner writes from Rochdale). As the polls closed on perhaps the most bizarre by-election in recent decades, the former                     Celebrity Big Brother                     contestant thanked “every voter who took the time to send a message to the political class today”. Galloway — a serial by-election candidate — has been accused of using Rochdale to get himself back into parliament by capitalising on anger in Muslim communities over Labour’s Gaza stance. Votes are being counted in the town’s leisure centre, with Rochdale’s recently refurbished town hall out of action until its reopening on Sunday. Designed by the architect William Henry Crossland and opened in 1871 as a symbol of the town’s industrial standing, the grade I listed town hall is widely regarded as one of the UK’s finest examples of Victorian Gothic architecture. A four-year £20 million renovation project has restored the venue to its former glory, though not quite in time for tonight’s action. Stained glass windows, timber carvings and elaborate golden hand-painted panels have been traded instead for the bright green walls akin to the Whitbury New Town Leisure Centre of the 1990s comedy                     The Brittas Empire                    . The by-election was triggered by the death of the veteran Labour MP Sir Tony Lloyd on January 17, aged 73. He had announced the previous week week that he had been receiving treatment for blood cancer for some time but that it had transformed into “an aggressive and untreatable form of leukaemia”. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said that Lloyd’s death was a “terrible loss”, writing on Twitter/X: “We will remember his deep commitment to Labour values and his decency.” Lloyd, who was born in Stretford, south Manchester, was elected MP for Stretford in 1983. After boundary reviews, he moved to the seat of Manchester Central and, having won in 1997, he was chosen by Tony Blair to be a junior minister in the Foreign Office, where he served for two years. Although no top jobs in government followed, from 2006 he served for six years as chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party. Despite winning his seat at the 2010 election, he left parliament in 2012 to be police and crime commissioner for Greater Manchester. He later sought the role of mayor of the region but came second, behind Andy Burnham, in the competition to be the Labour candidate. This prompted a return to the Commons in 2017 as MP for Rochdale. Read our obituary of Sir Tony Lloyd Azhar Ali, who will sit as an independent MP if he is elected after Labour withdrew their support, has pledged to reopen the area’s maternity ward, invest in the town’s centre, and open free breakfast clubs in schools as part of his pitch to voters. George Galloway, 69, has said he is running to “teach Labour a lesson” on class and the war in Gaza in a constituency with 40,000 Muslim voters. “The number of people in Rochdale are vitally concerned with the issues that preoccupy me … there’s probably not a constituency in the whole country where there are more people concerned about Gaza than there are in Rochdale,” he said. “[No] more people concerned about Kashmir than there are in Rochdale. So, as I have been a spokesman for these causes for more than half a century in both cases, it’s obvious that I would be a candidate here.” Counting is under way in the Rochdale by-election, where 82,615 people were eligible to vote. The number of postal votes for the election is high, standing at 21,810, or more than a quarter of the electorate. The town is one of the most deprived in England and voted 60 per cent in favour of Brexit. It has also been the subject of Asian grooming gang scandals, with a major report in January concluding that young girls were left “at the mercy” of paedophiles due to failings by senior police and council bosses. Tony Lloyd easily won the seat for the Labour Party in the 2019 general election. He first won the seat in 2017 after his predecessor, Simon Danczuk, was blocked from standing for “inappropriate” messages sent to a 17-year-old girl, which he apologised for. Danczuk is standing for the Reform Party in the by-election. The Rochdale contest has been one of the most divisive by-election in recent years. The candidates have spoken of death threats and vandalism and some have been wearing stab vests on the campaign trail. Posters seeking support for George Galloway, who is standing for the Workers Party of Britain, were torn down. Simon Danczuk, who was the Rochdale MP for Labour from 2010 to 2017, but is now standing for the Reform Party, said he had been the subject of a death threat and police had made an arrest. Billy Howarth, who is standing as an independent, said he had been wearing a stab vest while campaigning because of tensions in the former mill town. Bookmakers have Azhar Ali and George Galloway neck and neck on their chances to win the Labour-held seat. Galloway, who was expelled from the Labour Party in 2003 after he criticised the war in Iraq before he became an MP for Bradford West, when he was a member of the Respect Party, had odds of 10/11 and Ali 5/6 to become the next MP.
