   Nigel Farage appears on anti-Brexit advert next to busy main road The Argus (Newsquest Regional Press) June 1, 2023 Thursday  Copyright 2023 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Length: 252 words Byline: Andrew Gardner Body   A giant anti-Brexit billboard with Nigel Farage's face on it has appeared on the side of a building next to a busy road. Campaign group Led By Donkeys is behind the poster which has the Farage quote "Brexit has failed". The billboard in Seaside, Eastbourne, is one of many that have appeared across the country. Farage has been a staunch supporter of Brexit since the referendum in 2016 but recently said it "has failed". The former Ukip leader was speaking during an interview on BBC Newsnight on May 15. Led By Donkeys launched a crowdfunding project to display the message across the country, raising more than 80,000 to spread the word on 150 billboards nationwide. 150 of these posters are now up in towns and cities across Britain. Thanks to everyone who chipped in. We thought as many ppl as possible should see @Nigel_Farage-s damning verdict on Brexit - and so did you.

Let-s get the word out across the country." Some 30,700 people from Eastbourne voted to leave in the EU referendum, compared with 22,845 remainers. Led By Donkeys attracted attention in Brighton in 2021 after it put up a billboard in robert Street showing the then Health Secretary Matt Hancock kissing his aide Gina Coladangelo at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, breaching restrictions at the time.
