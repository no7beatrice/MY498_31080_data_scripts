   We cannot forgive the damage that has been done; LETTERS&OPINION Exeter Express and Echo June 15, 2023 Thursday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 16,17 Length: 254 words Body   SO at last we are rid of the cheap chancer. His exit was as squalid as his lies, not just on Partygate but on the disaster of Brexit. Even Farage now admits Brexit's a "failure". But there were those in the Tory party who knew Johnson was not fit to be prime minister and knew Brexit was going to damage the UK economy. In late 2018 the Treasury report EU Exit long-term economic analysis stated that the UK GDP would lose 4.9 per cent with the hard Brexit that Johnson ended up with. It predicted the loss of free movement would result in a further loss of 1.8 per cent. The OBR still predicts a four per cent loss and a year ago the Centre for European Reform considered the loss to be already 5.5 per cent. Some of the more honourable MPs in the Tory party objected to Johnson's negotiations and were summarily dismissed from the parliamentary party. Others sat tight, sheepishly supporting Johnson's hard Brexit, caring first for their own jobs and second for the country. The disdain in which we hold Johnson must also be directed at the Tory party which supported him. Immediately prior to the referendum, local MP Mel Stride stated about Johnson's claim that after Brexit the NHS would get £350million/week extra: "Enjoy the animated pigs flying over this misleading whopper." In 2018 he was the Government minister who introduced the Treasury report to the Commons. Despite this, he supported every vote on Johnson's disastrous Brexit. We cannot forgive the damage that has been done. Mike Baldwin Jericho Street, Thorverton Load-Date: June 15, 2023  End of Document
