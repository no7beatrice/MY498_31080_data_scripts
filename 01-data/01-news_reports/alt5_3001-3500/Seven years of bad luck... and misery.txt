   Seven years of bad luck... and misery The Western Mail June 27, 2023 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 20 Length: 356 words Body   JUNE 23, 2023, marks seven years since the Brexit referendum. We can now look in the mirror of history and reflect on its impact. 1) "We send the EU £350m a week. Let's fund our NHS instead." T"  he killer slogan of Vote Leave during the 2016 campaign. In May 2016 the UK Statistics Authority said it was "disappointed" by Vote Leave's use of thefigure, saying: "As we have made clear, the UK's contribution to the EU is paid after the application of the rebate… … he continued use of a gross figure in contexts that imply it is a net figure is misleading and undermines trust in official statistics." 2) "Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU. Vote Leave, take back control." Vote Leave campaign poster published on May 23, 2016, falsely insinuated the entire population of Turkey would be able to work in the UK. 3) "We can take back control over UK waters, set our own fishing policies, and support our fishermen." Boris Johnson stated this in June 2016. The day after Brexit the fishing industry nearly collapsed as Boris hadn't even read, or fully understood the new Brexit deal. 4) ""he UK Government will continue to give farmers and the environment as much support - or perhaps even more - as now." Agriculture Minister George Eustice's speech at the launch of Farmers for Britain, March 23, 2016. Since then we now have a disastrous trade deal with Australia and New Zealand that will probably ruin Welsh farmers. 5) "Believe me, we'll have up to 40 [free trade agreements] ready for one second after midnight in March 2019". The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, Conservative Party conference, October 2017. Another Brexit lie. 6) Daily Express, October 18, 2016, falsely quoted "Cheaper food after EU exit: Consumer boost as experts now say that prices will come DOWN." We now live in a food crisis not helped by leaving the EU. 7) Theresa May, running for the leadership of the Conservative Party, July 2016, stated "Brexit means Brexit". Like a broken mirror gives seven years of bad luck, after seven years of misery we are all suffering the bad luck of Brexit, as they did not make a success of it.
