   Border is no barrier to growing your sales acumen thetimes.co.uk November 26, 2023 Sunday 12:01 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 1324 words Byline: Sandra O’Connell Highlight: Exporting to Northern Ireland may seem daunting in the wake of Brexit, but the opportunities far outweigh the challenges Body   Liscarroll Engineering was set up in the 1970s making milk tanks for farmers all over Ireland. Only recently has the Kerry company started selling into Northern Ireland. Cross-border trade was something that Padraig Lynch, the managing director, who joined the company four years ago, was determined to achieve. He joined from a start-up called Herd Insights, a maker of smart collars that help farmers know when a cow is in heat. It was set up in Cork in 2017 and quickly gained commercial traction in  Northern Ireland . Lynch reckoned Liscarroll Engineering could do the same. Indeed, the biggest challenge he faced when he joined Liscarroll was having “a single product in a single market”, he says. His first task was to develop a suite of new products. His second was to start exporting them. Lynch wants one quarter of his revenues to come from outside the Republic of Ireland within three years. He’s nearly there. Thanks to a partnership with Dale Farm, a Northern Irish dairy company, about 20 per cent of Liscarroll’s island of Ireland revenues now come from the region. What’s more, its presence in Northern Ireland made it easier to sell into Scotland. “People were already aware of the brand there because of the Dale Farm link. I picked up three or four dealers in Scotland within a year,” says Lynch, who now sells across Britain. He credits  InterTrade Ireland , the cross-border trade development body, with helping him to kick-start this success. Lynch participated in its Acumen programme, which can subsidise the cost of a staff member, up to €21,562, dedicated to developing cross-border sales. It also provides support for market research including assessing pricing, routes to market and competitor analysis, as well as hosting workshops and networking events. Last month the agency launched Cross-Border Trade Hub, an online information resource for traders. Companies may also apply for up to €2,300 to cover the cost of specialist technical support to help them identify and exploit cross-border opportunities. The government has made a commitment to targeting an additional 2,000 Irish-owned exporters by 2030, and Northern Ireland makes a good starting point for many. Now that the dust has settled on Brexit, the Northern Ireland protocol and its successor, the  Windsor framework , the north is “still an easy market to sell into”, says Colin McCabrey, InterTrade Ireland’s director of trade. “We see it as a key first step into exporting, giving you the confidence to move into exporting off the island,” he adds. As companies look to bring their supply chains closer to home, in line with supply chain security and sustainability trends, Northern Ireland also represents a good sourcing opportunity, McCabrey points out. As the cost of living is lower in Northern Ireland, it can offer cost savings too. Although Brexit trading procedures are now established, the risk is that companies have been left with a vague feeling that cross-border trading is somehow difficult. “Perception is the biggest barrier,” McCabrey says. As the north has benefited from massive UK government  “levelling up” programmes  such as the Shared Prosperity Fund and Northern Ireland’s City and Growth Deals, there are enormous opportunities for businesses south of the border to tender for major public works there now too, he points out. Damien McDonnell of Polar Ice Tech, a dry ice cleaning company, also benefited from InterTrade Ireland’s Acumen fund. He took part in 2017 and has been building a customer base in Northern Ireland ever since. The company initially opened an office in the region but closed it in 2019 and now services the market from Cork. “NI is no problem,” McDonnell says. “In the early days we charged in sterling and with exchange rate and bank charges, you never really knew what you were getting until it landed. Then we changed over to invoicing in euros and have never had any issues since.” Companies closer to the border are typically more aware of the ease of cross-border trading, but as you move further away, that perception of ease changes, according to Jonathan McMillan, Enterprise Ireland’s regional director for the northeast. As a result, first-time Irish exporters are still typically more likely to look east to Britain rather than north. Despite that, total two-way cross-border trade is estimated at about €10 billion annually, and growing. “It’s colossal and has increased a lot over the last five or six years,” McMillan says. If you do opt to bill in sterling, selling into Northern Ireland can give you valuable experience in trading in a foreign currency, and then using the region as a springboard into Britain, he adds. There are some new challenges. For example, post-Brexit, if you’ve identified a worker who is neither Irish nor British to work for you in Northern Ireland, they may need to apply for a permit to live there. The possibility of future regulatory divergence remains a concern too. But in the main, the opportunities outweigh the challenges, which is why a new initiative from Network Ireland, a business group for women, and its Northern Irish counterpart, Women in Business, is helping female founders to develop cross-border trade. Emma Early Murphy, the Network Ireland president, helped develop the programme — which is called Grow It All-Island and is funded by InterTrade Ireland — as a result of her positive experience working in the north. Partnering with an events company across the border has helped her grow sales and expand her business’s reach, and vice versa. The recently launched programme, which begins in December, was inundated with applicants, one of whom best summed up the need for it, says Early Murphy. “She told us she already did a little bit of business in the north, but never had the chance to explore the opportunity for more.” It’s an opportunity Jason Kidd, owner of Outcast Brands, is exploring too. His company, which was established in 2020, makes spirits such as Blood Monkey gin and Two Shores rum. It already exports to 12 international markets, including Canada, Sweden and the Netherlands. But apart from shelf space at George Best airport in Belfast, it’s only now that the Malahide-based business is looking properly at Northern Ireland. “It’s about understanding the opportunity and making sure we partner with the right distributors,” Kidd says. Last week he and his staff attended a “meet the buyers” event organised by a Northern Ireland chamber of commerce. It proved fruitful. “The event was good,” Kidd says. “We met with ferry and hotel operators, and I’ve an opportunity to go back and talk some more this Thursday, so I’ll be going back up the road.”                    Trading across the border                    Post-Brexit, the Northern Ireland protocol ensured a hard border was avoided on the island of Ireland. The Windsor framework, announced in February, ensured a border on the Irish sea was avoided too. It applies to traders based in Northern Ireland and to goods imported into the region. It simplifies customs procedures, facilitates parcel post and expands the existing trusted trader scheme. Its changes are being introduced on a phased basis. In September this year the trusted trader scheme was expanded. September next year will see the introduction of new facilitations for freight and parcels travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland. According to Revenue, goods that are destined for Ireland but shipped through Northern Ireland continue to be subject to full customs and import requirements. This means Irish traders must complete their customs formalities in the north, or move their goods under the customs transit procedure, for the completion of formalities on arrival at an authorised premises in Ireland. The Windsor framework doesn’t change the fact that there is no land border — no checks and controls — between Ireland and Northern Ireland, or the fact that the region has free access to both the EU and British markets.
