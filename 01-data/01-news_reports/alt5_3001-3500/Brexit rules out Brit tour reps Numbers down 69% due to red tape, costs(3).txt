   Brexit rules out Brit tour reps; Numbers down 69% due to red tape, costs Daily Mirror June 16, 2023 Friday Edition 1, Scotland  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 16 Length: 260 words Byline: NATASHA WYNARCZYK Body   BREXIT is killing off the traditional British holiday rep with a 69% "nosedive" on the Continent in six years. Red tape, a lack of agreement with EU nations and extra costs are freezing youngsters out of tourism positions. The number of Brits working as reps, in ski chalets and as lifeguards has fallen from 11,970 in 2017 to 3,700 this year. And a poll of 170 travel firms by trade bodies ABTA and Seasonal Businesses in Travel found it was their top concern - with 61% saying it could hit their growth. Prior to the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020, Brits could live and work in the EU with no limits. It now costs an extra £880 to recruit a UK chalet worker in France, while many bloc nations have no viable entry routes. ABTA's Luke Petherbridge said there is "nothing stopping us" extending the Youth Mobility Scheme to the EU. It lets young people work for up to two years and we have a similar arrangement with Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Tourism expert Beverley Boden, of Teesside University, said: "As Brits head for Europe this summer, the oftenmissing element of great service can be a rep from the UK. Post-Brexit, the job is less appealing, resulting in this once sought-after role taking a nosedive." At ABTA's Travel Matters summit in Westminster, Aviation Minister Baroness Vere of Norbiton said she would like to see "more youngsters able to work in the EU" but added: "We have to put that in the context of our relationship with the EU and our other priorities at the time." natasha.wynarczyk@mirror.co.uk @tash_wynarczyk Graphic    TOUR DE FARCE Brexit has led to fewer British reps Load-Date: June 16, 2023  End of Document
