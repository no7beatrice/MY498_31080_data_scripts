   Tony Blair says the UK is 'too WEAK' to rejoin the EU with the economy 'on its knees' - but the key Keir Starmer ally admits he still wants to reverse Brexit in the future MailOnline July 16, 2023 Sunday 9:16 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 403 words Byline: James Tapsfield, Political Editor For Mailonline Body                        Tony Blair today warned that the UK is 'too weak' to rejoin the EU at the moment - but suggested he still wants to reverse Brexit in the future. The former PM, increasingly seen as an influence on Keir Starmer's Labour, suggested Britain's economic woes were worse than other countries. In an interview with Sky News' Ridge on Sunday, he said trying to restore full ties with Brussels while the country is 'on its knees' would not end well. But Sir Tony admitted he would still 'love' Brexit never to have happened, and 'future generations' could reinstate membership. The comments came as Rishi Sunak launched a barb at Sir Keir's pro-European record. The premier hailed the UK signing a deal to join the huge Indo-Pacific trade bloc, saying the government is 'delivering on our Brexit freedoms to grow the economy'.  Sir Tony, who is due to appear at an event with Sir Keir this week, said he was 'very worried' about the state of the economy. 'Lots of other countries have similar problems but I think ours are worse,' he said. On Brexit, the former Labour leader conceded that trying to rejoin the EU now would suck up political energy. 'This country is only going to be ready to rejoin when it's strong. You don't want to go back into the EU on your knees,' he said.  Sir Tony added about the departure from the bloc: 'I would love it if it never happened... going fully back into the EU, for future generations, is another matter.' Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch today put pen to paper on membership of the CCTPP group made up of Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.  The area includes 500million people and has a combined GDP of around £12trillion. After the ceremony in Auckland, Ms Badenoch said: 'This will be a big boost for British businesses and open up huge opportunities and unparalleled access to a market of over 500 million people in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.' Mr Sunak said the government is 'delivering on our Brexit freedoms to grow the economy'. 'If we hadn't defeated Keir Starmer's campaign to reverse Brexit, this simply would not have been possible,' he added. Officials underlined the importance of the deal despite the distance from the UK by pointing out that one in every 100 workers here was employed by a business headquartered in a CPTPP member nation in 2019 - equivalent to over 400,000 jobs across the country.
