   Rejoiners should blame right people; Letters East Anglian Daily Times June 2, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 24 Length: 286 words Body   OK, I will join in too, to keep the chain going. EU rejoiner John Dell's letter (EADT, May 26) was given a prominent position with a picture of Nigel Farage waving the British flag, with the headline "Waving goodbye to Farage?" John gave us his interpretation of a recently published YouGov poll. He stated 'that 9% of the British public concluded that Brexit has been more of a failure than a success." The following day a second similar 'let's-bash-Farage' letter was published - 'Farage should take blame' by rejoiner Richard Hare. Richard claimed that "just 9% of Britons now believe that Brexit was a good idea." And at the time of writing - a third anti-Farage letter has been published (May 30) this time written by Harvey Clegg: "easons why I voted remain." I am pleased that these gentlemen have written in to get things off their chest. Rejoiners should ask themselves who was in charge of implementing Brexit. Was it the said Nigel Farage? Did he have influence over the decision-making and implementation of said Brexit? No, he was not invited to. (More is the pity as I would liked to have seen him help sway the decision makers!). So yes, as a staunch Brexiteer, I can clearly understand why Nigel might have said that Brexit has not been ideal, to his liking or satisfaction - as it is NOT a true Brexit that he, I and many others campaigned for. So, I would implore the rejoiners to point the finger of blame at the right people - those in charge and those opposed to the true implementation of Brexit. Some may call them the "enemy within". Regardless of any disappointing outcome in certain areas, Brexit remains for me the absolute correct www.decision.No change of mind for me. IAN SMITH, Bury St Edmunds.
