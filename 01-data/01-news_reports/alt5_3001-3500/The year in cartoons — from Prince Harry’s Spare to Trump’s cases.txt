   The year in cartoons — from Prince Harry’s Spare to Trump’s cases thetimes.co.uk December 23, 2023 Saturday 12:01 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved  Length: 4829 words Byline: Peter Brookes | Georgina Roberts Highlight: Royal revelations, the coronation, government sackings, bloodshed in the Middle East … Here’s Times cartoonist Peter Brookes’s round-up of 2023 Body   There was plenty of drama in British politics this year, with the  coronation  of a new monarch and the surprise return of  a former prime minister to the cabinet . But it was the horrors of war abroad that most occupied Times cartoonist Peter Brookes, as death tolls soared in Gaza and  Ukraine . “Last year was all about the number of prime ministers; this time, it’s the number of wars. Gaza is all engrossing,” Brookes says. “Even before that, there was ‘Ukraine fatigue’. It’s desperate for Ukraine, because the attention has moved and I can’t just drop in cartoons about it because I think it needs recognition.” Slaughter on both sides of the  Israel-Hamas conflict  made it a tricky subject to grapple with. “In Ukraine, it’s obvious who’s right and who’s wrong. It’s easy to go for the baddy. The Middle East crisis is much more complex.” Shocking images of dead bodies were splashed across the papers. “The difficulty for me is, those photographs do the job far more graphically than a cartoonist who wasn’t there,” he says. The other big challenge Brookes faced was shortening his working week from four days to three. “Doing three days, you do miss out on an awful lot. It’s been difficult. But it was my choice — I’m over 80 now and this is the only way I can carry on working as long as possible.” In one of the biggest political shocks of the year, David Cameron returned to an ailing government as foreign secretary, seven years after he unceremoniously exited No 10. “It surprised everyone. He completely buggered the whole thing up by taking us into Brexit. So his reputation was not as polished as his cheeks.” Rishi Sunak’s shaky first year in power has been marred by disruptive rail and doctor  strikes  and a punishing cost of living crisis. “Everyone thought he was a reasonably safe pair of hands after Truss and Johnson. But it’s fast turning out that he’s not. I don’t think Sunak’s a great political operator. Even Johnson was a cleverer political operator,” he says. King Charles  was also new to the top job. The monarchy was celebrated in May’s coronation, after being rocked by the revelations of Prince Harry’s blush-inducing memoir,  Spare . “Harry got the hammering he deserved,” Brookes says. After his indictments, the idea of  Donald Trump  behind bars was regularly lampooned by Brookes, as was the octogenarian president,  Joe Biden . “People have said to me, ‘How can you make comments about how old Biden is when you are exactly the same age?’ I say, ‘Well, I’m not trying to be president of the United States.’ ”                     Georgina Roberts                    January                    04.01 Spare                    Peter Brookes says: “This was fortuitous, combining the title of Prince Harry’s book,                     Spare                    , with a heartfelt plea on my part. Annoyingly for me, a bit later someone did actually bring out a joke book called                     Spare Us                    , featuring Harry with a gag across his mouth.”                    21.01 All quiet on the Westminster front                     “Rishi Sunak had been fined for not wearing a seatbelt and he’s quiet here because the belt is over his mouth. As a play on All Quiet on the Western Front, I got to draw Boris Johnson with his German helmet, which seemed to suit him. He was always popping back up.”                    18.01 Get a grip, Rowley                    “Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said he was ‘sorry’ for the force’s failure to remove rapist David Carrick from its ranks. If anyone could sort the Met out, I thought it would be Sarah Lancashire’s character from                     Happy Valley                    . She was absolutely brilliant.                     Happy Valley                     was a huge show and I loved it.”                    20.01 Not levelling with anyone                    “ Nadhim Zahawi’s taxes  were being investigated. In a cost of living crisis, it’s not a great look to be seen to be fiddling your tax. Zahawi was always on a sticky wicket — even if he’d not done anything criminal, he’d made loads of money. Despite being on his way out for a long time, he hung on for a few more days.” February                    15.02 After Banksy                    “This was the peculiar story of ‘spy’ balloons from China that were floating across the States. Everyone kicked off, but they turned out to be relatively harmless. Not having done a Valentine’s Day cartoon on the actual day, Banksy’s heart-shaped balloon was my attempt to claw that back.”                    01.02 Don’t blame us                    “It had been three years since Brexit, and things were looking really bad. So here are these two Brexiteers saying the war in Ukraine and the after-effects of Covid were the reasons the economy was tanking — blaming it all on that, rather than the situation they engineered. I draw the red Brexit bus perhaps once a year — it stands out. Here, the wheels have literally come off.”                    03.02 Profiting from war                    “This was the week that Shell reported its highest annual profit of $40 billion. An awful lot of that was down to the Ukraine war, and this was my way of reflecting that.”                    24.02 Mission: Impossible                    “Sir Keir Starmer had just come up with his  five mission statements , so I used the Mission: Impossible franchise to show that. He makes an unconvincing Tom Cruise, but then sometimes Tom Cruise makes an unconvincing Tom Cruise. Rishi Sunak had unveiled five priorities too, the previous month — politicians do like to have their five bullet points.”                    09.02 My human shield                    “Zelensky came to the UK and Sunak, who’d put no limit on possible military assistance, was trying a similar ploy to Johnson, who used to go to Ukraine any time something looked bad at home. It hasn’t been quite as obvious, but it was the same way of distracting attention. I’d done a Zelensky human shield cartoon with Johnson last year, so here’s Sunak trying the same trick.”                    02.02 But I had no idea                    “Sunak was pretending not to be aware that Dominic Raab had any  bullying proclivities , but he was facing calls to suspend the deputy prime minister over the ongoing investigation into his behaviour. So here you’ve got Sunak being squashed by this brute.”                    11.02 Poisonous fungi                    “These are horrendous people, but they’re subjects who are excellent to draw. I included the ‘Women, Life, Freedom’ slogan because, following the murder of Mahsa Amini for not wearing her hijab in September 2022, the protests in Iran were still going on.”                    10.02 Fighter jets?                    “Volodymyr Zelensky was being very forceful, asking Ukraine’s allies for combat aircraft. The cartoon was based on the idea of them all saying yes to his request, but agreeing in a sort of pusillanimous way, because what they actually meant was, ‘No.’ ” March                    02.03 Buy my book                    “Hancock had his                     Pandemic Diaries                     out, and its co-author, Isabel Oakeshott, dished the dirt on him by leaking 100,000 of his  WhatsApp messages . She’s shacked up with Richard Tice, the leader of Reform UK: the Brexit Party. They’re something of a power couple.”                    30.03 Great expectations                    “I love Dickens and                     Great Expectations                    , which is a great book. Prison hulks loom large in it, as they do now off the south coast. I loved drawing this prison boat, but I don’t love the current variety.”                    09.03 Nazi jibes are odious                    “This was a big story — Gary Lineker was refusing to delete a tweet  comparing the government to Nazis . The joke here is, ‘I was only obeying orders,’ but Lineker was not obeying orders. I thought it was daft of him to say something Nazi-related like that — ham-fisted, really.”                    10.03 Le can’t can’t                    “Sunak was in Paris asking Macron, ‘Will you take back cross-Channel migrants?’ No was the answer. So I’ve got Macron kicking Sunak where it hurts. I used this Toulouse-Lautrec painting before, years ago. If it works, it works.”                    11.03 Georgia on my mind                    “There had been a series of protests taking place in Georgia that week, which Putin had invaded back in 2008. So I used the song to link him to the country.”                    22.03 Pants on fire                    “Johnson was trying to get his father awarded a knighthood, but ‘Sir Stanley’ wasn’t going to happen. At the same time, he was also talking to Harriet Harman’s privileges committee about partygate and lockdown breaches — so trashing all the rules was happening big time with him.”                    29.03 Democracy                    “Benjamin Netanyahu was back in power in Israel because he co-opted right-wing nasties to put a coalition together. They were trying to diminish the power of the courts because it didn’t suit their demagogic ways — hence the ‘democracy’ egg timer. There were even protests in the army. Netanyahu is not a good man.”                    31.03 Pay freeze                    “This week saw a lot of strike action — the railways, the civil service, the Border Force — and Charles’s income was once again frozen. But he’s still got all this stuff: seven palaces, ten castles …”                    Get your own Peter Brookes cartoon. Fine art print copies from £58 plus P&P.

So what you’ve got here is a firing squad, thinking it’s going to execute him, but all shooting themselves in the foot instead. Speaking of shooting yourself in the foot, I’ve put the wrong date on here.”                    14.04 Sacred texts                    “We didn’t know whether a) Harry was going to turn up to the coronation, and b) if he did, what his role would be. I saw him putting out the ‘bibles’, or copies of                     Spare                    .”                    13.04 I just love Ireland                    “This got 11 million views on Twitter — the Irish Republic went completely bananas. It was nuts. Biden was going from Northern Ireland to the south and making such a big thing of being at home in the south — in other words, the north was a complete case. People said it was racist because I dressed Biden as a leprechaun, but I gather you can buy leprechaun outfits at Dublin airport. Irish radio stations were calling me up and there were Op Ed articles in the Irish Times about it.”                    15.04 Freshwater fish                     “This is a slightly different Nature Notes, because unlike most of them it doesn’t include any politicians’ faces. But there had been a spate of news stories about how polluted our rivers were, which was more than a good enough theme.”                    29.04 Conflict of interest                    “The BBC chairman,  Richard Sharp , had helped facilitate an £800,000 loan for Johnson. He didn’t have a leg to stand on and, although it took a while, eventually he resigned.”                    07.04 Always look on the bright side                    “I still find it difficult to believe the police put up a blue tent in Nicola Sturgeon and her husband’s garden when searching their house during the SNP funding inquiry. Amazing. The gallery owner I sell through is a big mate of Eric Idle, who wrote                     Always Look on the Bright Side of Life                    , and sent this to him. Idle said, ‘Wow.’ ” May                    06.05 Heir presumptuous                    “The day of the coronation was a bloody difficult one for cartoonists, because what can you do ahead of the coronation? So you do a political parallel instead. That week’s local elections were a big thing, so this is Starmer being overconfident about getting to No 10 and holding the trappings of power.”                    11.05 Trump’s trousers                    “This was about Trump and  E Jean Carroll , the woman who took him to court. She had asked him to give his advice on some clothes she was trying on in a store and she accused him of assaulting her in the changing room. So it’s an emblem for a possible 2024 Trump presidency.”                    17.05 Vultures circling                    “The knives were out for Sunak in the Tory party, with people already anticipating an election defeat and leadership contest. So I used the Conservative symbol, a tree, to show that the vultures were ready for him.”                    18.05 Hey, you’re never too old                    “Martha Stewart was on the cover of Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue at 81. Biden was 80 at the time, but it’s pretty close. I’ve made some ageist jokes about Biden this year, but I make no apologies: he’s too old for the job.”                    05.05 How outrageous …                     “Vladimir Putin said Ukrainian forces had tried to assassinate him in a drone attack this week. It’s hardly an ‘outrageous’ act, though, when he’s killing women and children indiscriminately.”                    27.05 Downing Street collision                    “There was that car that crashed into the Downing Street gates — a very strange case. So this lot are all smashing into the same barriers, trying to get past Sunak into No 10.”                    24.05 The Tory Family                    “Raab had finally fallen on his sword and was leaving to spend less time with this Addams Family. Here Lurch is Raab, Uncle Fester is Javid, Grandmama is Thérèse Coffey and Wednesday is Rees-Mogg. Note Johnson as Thing. I’ve got this on the cover of my calendar this year.”                    To order the 2024 Peter Brookes calendar for only £15.99 plus delivery go to                    timescartoons.co.uk                     or call 020 7711 7826                   19.05 Water, water everywhere, and not a drop to drink                    “The Times had been running its  Clean It Up  campaign since February, and this week saw water bosses from across the UK saying sorry for sewage spills while trousering millions. So here’s my play on ‘cleaning up’.”                    04.05 Voting? How quaint …                    “It was announced that members of the public were invited to get on their knees and pledge allegiance to King Charles if they were watching the coronation at home. It was daft and quite weird. But it gave me a chance to link the coronation to the local elections.” June                    30.06 Dream on                    “The first planned migrant flight to Rwanda had already been cancelled at the last minute a few weeks earlier — now the Court of Appeal deemed the policy unlawful. And flights are still suspended, following November’s Supreme Court ruling.”                    01.06 Forget extinction …                    “AI was in the news this week — a group of tech leaders had been warning of  the risk of extinction posed by AI  — and the rail strikes were still dragging on. Still, this cartoon is much more of a reality now. I’m sure there will be more strikes because I don’t think people want driverless trains.”                    02.06 Free speech for all                    “Sunak appointed a Cambridge professor, Arif Ahmed, as the first free speech tsar. The link was, Sunak himself was not handing over his own WhatsApp messages to the Covid inquiry.”                    08.06 Special relationship                    “Sunak had a two-day visit to Washington. This was a heightist cartoon — Biden at 6ft is looking straight past Sunak, who’s 5ft 6in. He can’t see him.”                    17.06 Liar bird                    “Johnson’s a liar bird, well, for obvious reasons, and the privileges committee had just published its report stating he repeatedly misled parliament about partygate.”                    22.06 Life-saving efforts                    “The search for the Titan sub was a huge story. It created massive interest and an international rescue effort. Five people were on board. But when this  refugee boat from Tripoli  sank, with more than 80 confirmed dead and hundreds missing, there was no comparison in terms of the human resources expended.”                    10.06 Labour’s green pledge                    “Labour postponed their £28 billion green pledge — a bit embarrassing, that. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves pulled it, so she’s Gromit, getting her teeth into its architect, Ed ‘Wallace’ Miliband. I did Ed Balls as Gromit for a long time, and Alan Johnson was him once. Now I’ve got Reeves. I’ll be drawing a lot more of her.” July                    20.07 Long Boris                    “A Tory spoke about the party suffering from ‘long Boris’ — a really good description. He wasn’t going to come back any time soon, but the speculation just went on and on. Because of Johnson’s hair, it couldn’t be anyone else, and that’s the joy of these things for me: people can be reduced to just an outline.”                    08.07 Looming losses                    “All these by-elections meant bye-bye. Of the five, three would happen within weeks. Nadine Dorries was one of the others, and then there was Chris Pincher, who was accused of sexually assaulting two men. That’s what was really the final nail in Boris Johnson’s coffin, trying to support Pincher and keep him on.”                    22.07 Uxbridge                     “The Tories won the  Uxbridge by-election , but it was a Pyrrhic victory. Here’s Sunak letting everyone know that he’s a winner, when in fact he lost two other by-elections the same day. A supporter may be raising his hand, but the guy’s flat on his back, beaten up, a bit of a no-hoper.”                    27.07 The wild NatWest                    “The boss of NatWest, Dame Alison Rose, was under pressure because of the Farage scandal at NatWest subsidiary Coutts and what she’d told the BBC. It was a big deal — and an even bigger deal when she lost out on seven million quid in potential payments after she resigned.”                    28.07 What took you so long?                     “ Andrew Malkinson  spent 17 years in prison for a rape he didn’t commit before the Court of Appeal finally quashed his conviction. This made me — and so many others — very angry. He wrote via his solicitor to ask for a print of this.”                    29.07 Aggressive displays                    “For this Nature Notes about Coutts, I was able to use coots, the birds — a gift. When I draw Farage, there’s usually a glass of beer that he’s either drinking or chucking over somebody, and a fag in his mouth. And in this case, his claws are out.” August                    03.08 I do solemnly swear …                    “This came out of the idea that Trump could still be president from jail, which struck me and everyone as being not only absurd, but all too possible. I love working out ways of doing something like this, and the desk was the obvious thing for me. You keep coming up with variations on a theme, because the theme is so compulsive.”                    04.08 Welcome to the land of Mickey Mouse                    “Rishi was on holiday in California and I wanted to highlight the Mickey Mouse nature of his five pledges.” September                    07.09 Lightweight material, crumbles under pressure                    “Raac concrete was so widespread, it looked like every school was going to have to close and education secretary  Gillian Keegan  was in a spot of bother. The result was, she became another lippy, mouthy cabinet member, like Braverman. This cartoon isn’t a way of getting out of having to draw Keegan, who is not very easy to do. But she did make a very good block of Raac.”                    22.09 Not about the election                    “Sunak rowed back on his promises to ban new petrol and diesel cars — an obvious electoral ploy. This was just before the Tory conference, when he came up with several other wheezes that have gone down like lead balloons.”                    08.09 Horizon Europe                    “Britain re-entering  Horizon Europe , the scientific research initiative, was a bit of good news. It was Sunak’s way of saying, ‘We’re not stuck in the Brexit prison.’ Then that guy escaped from HMP Wandsworth — it’s always good for cartoonists when two things happen at the same time. I like doing these drawings that work on two levels — portmanteau cartoons, they call them.”                    29.09 Getting ready …                    “It was the Friday before the Tory conference and it was widely expected that Sunak would scrap HS2. But it wasn’t certain. So I had ‘Getting ready’, with the sign that I imagined they might put up in Manchester. And there Sunak is, giving two fingers.”                    30.09 Iconic tree felled                    “It was so outrageous when the Sycamore Gap tree at Hadrian’s Wall was cut down — an absolute scandal. The tree was a wonderful symbol, and unmissable really to use as a metaphor. So I had the Tory tree again, and Labour chopping it down — ‘not many mourners’ for that, but there were for the actual tree.”                    15.09 Dumping ground                    “The pot’s calling the kettle black, because Braverman said that Starmer was going to make Britain a dumping ground for illegal migrants, which is really what she’s done. Although I’m not against that, because I don’t see migrants in the same way that she does — we can take more than she’d ever admit were possible. I rather feel I shall be drawing Starmer a lot during the next year.”                    02.09 Bright future                    “There were train strikes, schools were closing because of Raac concrete, junior doctors and consultants were on strike … I just wanted to do something that tied all these things together, to find a way to show that the country was going down the tubes and nothing was going right. And it was a good excuse to draw a country station, which I love doing.”                    16.09 Coming up short                    “Sunak’s pledges were becoming less and less substantial, so here’s the disappearing trousers trick. I like to play with the short trousers metaphor and have used it before, about interest rates. Here we go again, but with a different subject: the five pledges.” October                     12.10 State of insecurity                    “The October 7 Hamas attack happened on a Saturday morning, but I wasn’t down to do a cartoon until Thursday’s paper. So everything had already been seen and commented on, and I had to find some other way of looking at it. When something major and horrendous like this happens, such as 9/11, you have to do something quite graphic and quite simple. So I decided to use the Israeli flag to illustrate the insecurity of what happened and show Hamas breaking through. How on earth did they manage to breach Israel’s security the way they did? I’m sure Netanyahu already knows that he’s toast after the fighting has stopped.”                    13.10 Level playing field                    “The phrase ‘creating a level playing field’ just came to me first thing that morning. It is obviously intended ironically: Netanyahu doesn’t want that and he doesn’t believe in a two-state solution. He was levelling Gaza and it was going to go on and on. So you had visions of the whole of Gaza flattened to a landscape of rubble.”                    19.10 I’ve got your back …                    “When Biden visited Israel, I was taken by the body language of him hugging Netanyahu, who seemed to initiate it. Biden had given so many assurances to start with, I was certain it couldn’t last. When Israel hit back hard and the bodies mounted, someone would say, ‘This has got to stop.’ So ‘for now’ is what I was feeling.”                    07.10 On reflection                    “Support for Humza Yousaf’s SNP had collapsed at the  Rutherglen and Hamilton West by-election . I loved working out a way of not only saying something fundamental about how people’s belief had gone, but also making it interesting to look at.” November                    16.11 Don’t worry, I can still fix this                    “This was one of those days that goes skewwhiff and I have to rejig my thinking. When the Supreme Court ruled the Rwanda deal unlawful in the morning, I came up with a plan: a bubble quote from Sunak saying, ‘Oh God, we’ll have to go back to square one.’ But in the afternoon he said that, if it’s unlawful, then we’re going to make it lawful — and nothing was off the table. So I had to change tack. Hence Sunak as King Canute saying, ‘Don’t worry, I can still fix this.’ ”                    03.11 Covid inquiry bonfire                    “The Covid inquiry was one of the big things happening in the run-up to Bonfire Night. There wasn’t an awful lot new coming out, but the way it was couched, the language, was new. All the hate … And they were all ready to dump on Johnson, quite rightly. I put Matt Hancock in his pocket.”                    10.11 Hate march                    “Braverman mentioned ‘hate marchers’ in a  Times comment piece  about pro-Palestinian marches. It was widely thought that she’d be gone by the end of the day, so I had to do something that would work if she was out, but also if she was still there.”                    02.11 Cease … fire!                    “This cartoon remains as true as I saw it when I drew it, but the loss of Gazan civilian lives in such huge numbers since surely makes a ceasefire imperative. This is the dilemma of it all.”                    17.11 The spotlight moves on                    “Cameron went to Kyiv to meet Zelensky. The point I was making here was that, because of Israel and Gaza, the focus has moved from Ukraine. So Zelensky is comparing his lot with Cameron’s before he came back — feeling lost or forgotten. I’ve enjoyed being able to focus on Cameron again — he’s still got his hair, which is important because I always drew him with a little plume of hair at the top.”                    24.11 Taxes                    “Chancellor Jeremy Hunt following the autumn statement, him seeing what he wants to see in the mirror, the rest of us knowing the truth.”                    25.11 Turn back!                    “This was  a ridiculous row . Its constituency MP accused the home secretary, James Cleverly, of calling Stockton North a ‘shithole’ at PMQs. Cleverly tried to make out he’d said, ‘because you’re a shit MP’, which doesn’t scan the same or come across like that on a microphone. And immigration had gone up to 750,000. So I turned their argument into a comment about migrants and small boats. I mean, why would you want to come here?” December                    01.12 You taught me all I know                    “ Henry Kissinger  died. I can’t see how people have been praising Kissinger the way they have been, when he was the author of so much killing and destruction. He may have brought peace, but it was at huge, huge costs to civilians. If Putin and President Xi both praise you to the sky when you die, that must mean you’re a pretty bad lot. I’m comparing Kissinger to Netanyahu here in terms of bombing. The Israelis are defending the high body count in Gaza by saying they do their best to prevent civilian deaths, which is nonsense when you consider the vast majority of Gazans killed are civilians. Israel has got to stop this massive death toll.  Some people complained  that this cartoon is antisemitic — it’s not.”                    07.12 We did our level best                    “At the Covid inquiry Boris Johnson was shown evidence from the notes of Sir Patrick Vallance, who had been chief scientific adviser to the government, that he’d used the phrase, ‘Let it all rip,’ and said that the elderly had had ‘a good innings’. He also was accused by former adviser Dominic Cummings of having said, ‘Let the bodies pile high.’ This reported callousness prompted me to draw him, not as the clown that he is often described as, but as a ‘killer clown’. This was the cover of today’s print version of the Magazine.”                    02.12 We’re here for climate deals!                    “Cop28 was happening in Dubai and Cameron and Sunak were there. They all went on private planes — that in itself is a story — but here I’m pointing out Cameron’s less than squeaky-clean past. He may well do good things as foreign secretary, but his comeback has reignited interest in the Greensill scandal. People are now digging over his recent past.”                    09.12 Stop the boat                    “The immigration minister Robert Jenrick had resigned and after a year of endless Conservative cheerleading about stopping the boats, the ferryman of the dead has come for the Tories.” Load-Date: December 22, 2023  End of Document
