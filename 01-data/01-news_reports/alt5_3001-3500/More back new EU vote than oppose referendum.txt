   More back new EU vote than oppose referendum South Wales Echo August 15, 2023 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 4 Length: 391 words Body   MORE people in the UK think there should be another EU referendum in the next 10 years than those who oppose it. Polling by YouGov reveals that while "Bregret" is very high, there is no immediate appetite among people in the UK to reverse the decision. Just 26% say there should be a referendum on the matter before the end of 2023, with 59% saying there shouldn't be. The key takeaways from the polling are: ¦ Just 26% say there should referendum on rejoining the EU before the end of 2023; ¦ 46% support revisiting the question within the next 10 years; ¦ 30% of Britons say Brexit is done, although 49% still say it is not; ¦ were a referendum to be held now, 50% of Britons say they would vote to join the European Union; and ¦ among 18-24-year-olds an overwhelming majority (70%) would vote to join the European Union. When asked if there should be a referendum in the next five years, 39% agreed there should be, but 44% thought not. As for one in the next 10 years, the majority favours a new EU referendum, with 46% in favour, compared to 36% against. Unsurprisingly, it is Remain voters who are most in favour of a new EU referendum, with 41% saying there should be one this year, 61% saying so within the next five years, and 70% in the next 10 years. In contrast, only 8% of Leave voters support a referendum in 2023, 16% think there should be one in the next five years, and 20% within the next 10 years. While Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has ruled out rejoining the EU, most of those who currently intend to vote Labour say there should be another referendum in the next five years (63%) or ten years (69%). Few current Tory voters agree, at 13% and 21%, respectively. Were a referendum to be held, figures suggest the 'Re-join' side would likely win, with 50% of Britons saying they would vote to join the European Union, compared to just 30% saying they'd vote to stay out. This is heavily driven by those who currently intend to vote Labour and 2016 Remain voters, with 78% and 82% respectively saying they'd vote to re-join, compared to just 20% of current Conservative voters and 15% of Leave voters. While many regret and even want to overturn Brexit, do they think Brexit is 'done' in the first place? There has been a rise in the number of Britons seeing Brexit as 'done', but overall, they still think there is more 'Brexit-ing' to do. Load-Date: October 31, 2023  End of Document
