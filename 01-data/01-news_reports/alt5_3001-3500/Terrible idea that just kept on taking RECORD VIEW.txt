   Terrible idea that just kept on taking; RECORD VIEW Daily Record and Sunday Mail June 29, 2023 Thursday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Copyright © 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; TEASERS; Pg. 8 Length: 268 words Body   THE list of damages caused by Brexit grows ever longer. The reckless and unjustified decision to terminate the UK's membership of the European Union has already dented the economy and pushed up prices. It makes life more difficult for Scots travelling abroad and pushes the cost of doing business higher and higher. Now we learn that health officials were so concerned about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit that pandemic planning in the months before Covid was hampered. A board set up to work on how to deal with such an event had to suspend meetings for over six months prior to the coronavirus outbreak. It was set up by then deputy first minister John Swinney in 2017 to better prepare Scotland for a future pandemic. But progress was slow and the brakes were put on in 2018 when attention was focused to dealing with the impact of a no-deal Brexit. This does not absolve the SNP government of mistakes it made during the pandemic, but the Tories' Brexit obsession had a negative impact on how we dealt with Covid. It's easy to forget now just what kind of chaos would have been caused by the UK pulling out of negotiations and ripping up its relationship with the EU. There were real fears that lifesaving drugs would be delayed at ports and patients would die as a result. It's not the fault of health officials that they had to prepare for such a scenario. The blame lies with Boris Johnson's government, which was determined to push through Brexit whatever the cost. Who knows how many lives could have been saved if health officials had not had their attention focused elsewhere. BREXIT HAMPERED COVID PREP - PAGE 12 Load-Date: June 29, 2023  End of Document
