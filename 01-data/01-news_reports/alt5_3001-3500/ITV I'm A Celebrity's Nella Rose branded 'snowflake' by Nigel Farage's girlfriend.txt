   ITV I'm A Celebrity's Nella Rose branded 'snowflake' by Nigel Farage's girlfriend mirror.co.uk December 1, 2023 Friday 10:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: TV NEWS; Version:1 Length: 1160 words Byline: By, Mark Jefferies Highlight: The YouTube star has clashed with Nigel in the Australian jungle over political issues including Brexit and cultural appropriation. Farage's girlfriend also hit out at Fred Sirieix. Body   The girlfriend of Nigel Farage has started a war of words with his campmates -by dubbing Nella Rose a "snowflake" and Fred Sirieix "rude". In her first ever TV interview, Laure Ferrari criticised First Dates star Fred, who has been the contestant most vocal in criticism of Farage for his part in Brexit. And YouTuber Rose also got both barrels for tackling Farage over a variety of issues including immigration. Ferrari said: "Fred annoyed me. And don't forget, I'm French. I was like, well, isn't it a bit rude to come from a different country and lecture the British electorate about the way the British people voted in 2016 "I just think it's out of place to be honest with you. But to be fair to Fred he sort of made peace with Nigel and then they shared a couple of jokes and that was it. Nigel's used to these discussions and, I mean, he didn't back down, did he It's easy-peasy. He's been dealing with enemies and attacks and jokes for decades. We're talking about actually serious stuff like death threats, threats on your family members and things like that. So having an argument with Fred is really not going to faze him at all." Turning to Nella she said: "I feel sorry for Nella. I think she epitomises that snowflake generation where they are told that they should be offended by every little thing. And it's not a good place to be when you're offended and upset all the time. I think he has been very gentle with her. But again that's the sort of man he is. Maybe ITV or people were expecting him to be a bit more punchy and a bit more aggressive. But he has lots of patience. He understands people and he actually understands this generation very well and that's one of the reasons why he's in there." The comments could make things awkward when Ferrari meets other families at the hotel where all the friends and family stay, as she is expected to join Farage in Australia. But she didn't stop there and spoke of plans for Farage to return to politics and defended him over claims of racism. Ferrari, 44, has been the rumoured partner of Farage for some time but has now confirmed they are an item in an interview earlier this week. Ferrari and Farage, 59, met in Strasbourg in her native France in 2007, when she was working as a waitress. Initially they were just good friends before it blossomed into more. Speaking to Patrick Christys in an interview broadcast on GB News, Ferrari also blasted claims she works for Nigel, and tipped him to one day be Prime Minister saying he was the only person who could turn around Britain's fortunes and that he felt he had a duty to serve. On his future, she said: "He might be considering going back to politics at some stage. And if you want to do that and if you want to win an election, of course you need to, to reach a larger audience especially to the young people who do not really do politics and will be voters one day. "The truth of the matter is, does he have a choice Nigel loves this country. And that's why he campaigned for Brexit, because it was too damning to see a country being run by a foreign body somewhere in Brussels. So that's why he was so determined and focused on Brexit. Brexit was delivered very badly. So it's heart-breaking for him, for people like me, for our friends, for family, for this country to see that we're being run by idiots, we are run by idiots, technically. I'm sorry for saying this. In that sense, Nigel probably will think that he has a duty to come back to politics." Asked if she'd like to end up in Downing Street alongside him she said: "It's really not on my bucket list, I'm going to be honest with you. But it's not about what you want. I think in life sometimes it's about what is best. The idea of it is scary. Much scarier than the jungle. I can tell you that. The jungle is just like a walk in the park really when you think about it because being Prime Minister is such a heavy responsibility on your shoulders. "But he would be a good Prime Minister. I would say that and I think he would do a good job at it. Of course I'm biased because he is the special man in my life. But you can see the potential in someone, and you can see he is clearly the best person in the UK right now to do the job." Since emerging on the political scene Nigel has had to face up to claims he is racist over some statements he has made over the years about immigration. These claims have left Ferrari furious. She said: "I've never heard Nigel say anything racist in my life. He's never said anything racist in front of me and if he was a racist, I wouldn't tolerate it myself. So it really annoys me. It couldn't be further from the truth." And hitting out at reports she's a "secret girlfriend" she told GB News "I've been reading all sorts of, you know, nonsensical articles about me being a secret girlfriend. I'm not a secret. I'm here. All our friends, family members know who I am. I do exist and I do support Nigel. It's very important for me to say that." Since entering the jungle, a war has waged over the amount of time Nigel is getting on air with accusations flying that ITV are editing him out. But, ironically, one person who wants to see him do as many tasks as possible is Laure. Explaining why she said: "I want to see him because the worst thing really in life is the fact we are not in touch. We can't communicate with the outside world. So I haven't spoken to him. So I'm pleased to see him, even if it's not always nice, you know, I'd rather see him doing nasty things than not see him at all. I believe in him. I know that if anyone can do it, it's him. He's so resilient. He has the resilience of a million men. He's mentally strong. And he likes a challenge. He likes a new challenge, and I think he sees this as a bit of an experience, a new experience. I think he's doing great and I'm fully confident." One of the most talked about scenes in the jungle so far was the moment Nigel bared his backside in the jungle shower. Laure said: "So the first time we saw his behind on TV, I was actually sat next to Nigel's mum! We watched the thing together and we looked at each other. We giggled because honestly at the end of the day it's just, a behind, it's just a bottom and it's clean. I don't believe in that nonsense of having your shower wearing your swimming trunks. "He's a clean man, you see. He's a clean man. He's very clean. He wanted a proper wash. He wants a proper wash. He likes the camp to be tidy, because it's very important."
