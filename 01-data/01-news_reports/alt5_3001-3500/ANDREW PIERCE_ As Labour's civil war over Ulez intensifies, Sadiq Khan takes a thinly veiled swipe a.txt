   ANDREW PIERCE: As Labour's civil war over Ulez intensifies, Sadiq Khan takes a thinly veiled swipe at Sir Keir Starmer over his silence on Brexit MailOnline July 30, 2023 Sunday 10:17 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: DEBATE; Version:1 Length: 640 words Byline: Andrew Pierce for the Daily Mail Body   Labour's civil war has intensified now that London's mayor Sadiq Khan has vowed to go ahead with the expansion of the Ultra-Low Emission Zone (Ulez) after winning a High Court challenge against it. Sir Keir Starmer is pushing to delay the expansion of the daily £12.50 tax on older cars, but Khan so far is refusing to back down. I hear there are other tensions between the mayor and the Labour leader, too - this time over Brexit. In a thinly veiled swipe at his boss, Khan has criticised the UK's policy towards Europe in The New York Times - a newspaper which loves to attack Britain. In an article headlined 'In the UK a disaster no one wants to talk about', Khan is quoted as saying: 'I'm frustrated that no one's talking about it.'  Describing Brexit as 'the elephant in the room', he told the newspaper the UK should forge closer trade and immigration ties with the EU. Starmer's Brexit policy is focused upon leaving behind 'arguments of the past'. Though he did, of course, demand a second referendum in the last Parliament, he's now desperate to avoid all discussion of Brexit for fear of alienating voters in the so-called Red Wall seats that turned blue at the 2019 election. For a supposed government- in-waiting, having their two most senior elected politicians in yet another dispute hardly inspires confidence. Joining the BBC's Test Match Special team at the Oval for the last encounter between England and Australia in the Ashes, Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy reminisced about his days as a chorister. 'I got this break when I was aged 11 and went to Peterborough as a choral scholar in the Cathedral School. I was a treble.' But he admitted it was hard to see that now. 'Haha. I'm a bit chunkier than I was then!'  In the 1990s, actor Brian Cox voiced Labour's political commercials when the party was led by Tony Blair. An avowed champion of Scottish independence, the Succession star then became cheerleader for Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP. Now, his politician of choice appears to be her ally-turned-foe Alex Salmond. Cox has recorded a video for the former SNP leader and Scottish first minister - now spearheading the rival pro-independence Alba Party - which will be broadcast during Salmond's Edinburgh Festival show The Ayes Have It! The Ayes Have It! Another nail in the SNP coffin?                      Cruise's new mission                    Tom Cruise can expect a call to give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee's new inquiry into the British film and television industry - but it could prove Mission Impossible. 'We'd like to hear from Cruise because his productions give a huge boost to UK studios,' says a source. MPs will accept evidence by Zoom if Cruise is unable to parachute into the Commons in person. Labour's membership has plummeted in the past 12 months to below the 400,000 mark. It's now around two thirds of the near 600,000 that Comrade Corbyn enjoyed. Members are deserting in their droves, perhaps fed up with the serial U-turning by Starmer.  Financier Warren Buffet's words, while chairman of investment bank Salomon Brothers during its own crisis of confidence in 1991, should be required reading for NatWest's directors: 'Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm and I will be ruthless.'  Chancellor Jeremy Hunt may be fumbling at the financial levers to get inflation under control, but he had a firm hand on the actual controls of a railway signal box in his Farnham constituency. The box at Haslemere, Surrey, dates from 1895 and is Grade II-listed but is to be replaced by a modern signals centre at Basingstoke. Hunt is backing a preservation campaign. 'It has so much history, and for me personally I realised a childhood dream to use the controls at a railway station,' the marathon-running MP told the Farnham Herald.
