   GOVE: BLOB STILL BITTER AT BREXIT; WHITEHALL 'WHINGERS' RAP The Sun (England) June 3, 2023 Saturday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 2 Length: 265 words Byline: NOA HOFFMAN Body   MICHAEL Gove last night openly attacked The Blob for treating Brexit as if it had been a big mistake. Mr Gove accused Remainer-minded civil servants of slowing down policy changes because they were still bitter about the divorce from Brussels. The Levelling Up Secretary claimed the Whitehall officials showed less enthusiasm for implementing Brexit policies. Mr Gove, a main cheerleader for the vote in 2016, told the Crisis What Crisis? podcast: "If we fast-forward to now, I think one of the issues, inescapably, has been the attitude that some people have had towards Brexit. "So there are some ministers who have been hard-driving, who have worried that across the civil service there was a sense that Brexit was a big, historic mistake. "Therefore, there hasn't been the same enthusiasm for some of the changes that are necessary as there might have been for other policy changes." Mr Gove is thought to have first used The Blob in 2013 to describe officials and teachers' unions he argued wanted to frustrate his changes when he was Education Secretary. In the podcast, meanwhile, Mr Gove also reflected on his sacking by Boris Johnson in July last year during his final days in office. He had been accused of disloyalty by allies of Mr Johnson when he visited Downing Street and urged the PM to step down. Mr Gove said: "I was at home with one particular very old friend. Boris rang. "He said, 'Look, I'm rearranging the Government and I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step back'. "And I said, 'So you're not going?'. And he said, 'No, no, I'm afraid you are'." noa.hoffman@thesun.co.uk Graphic    Blast ... Mr Gove Load-Date: June 3, 2023  End of Document
