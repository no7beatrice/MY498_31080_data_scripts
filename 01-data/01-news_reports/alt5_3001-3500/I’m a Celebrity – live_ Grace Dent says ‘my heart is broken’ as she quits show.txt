I have left the camp for medical reasons.                                         “My heart is broken, I have loved and enjoyed getting to know you all. You’ve held me up and it’s been a pleasure being your friend through this experience.                                         “Leaving you all at this stage will be one of the saddest things in my life.

We tried really hard,” she said. “She was trapped under a little side-by-side that we ride around our pond. This is in 2017. She was 8 or 9 or something like that. My father-in-law, my mother-in-law, me and my husband, we run to jump in to save her and you kind of in that moment you think, this is not real, she’s going to pop up, this isn’t real. I could feel her arm, and I’m jerking it, I couldn’t get her up because it’s a pretty heavy machine. In that moment you think, you know logically she’s been under water too long… nobody can live if they’ve been under water this long. You logically are thinking these things. “Then you hear the sirens coming. Thank god my mother-in-law, first thing she did was call 911… she was caught in the safety netting. So when they got there, she was not alive. They took her from me and they incubated her.” She continued: “I was sitting on the rocks, I’d thrown up on myself, the adrenaline, then I heard [my mother-in-law] call my mum and say, ‘Lynne, we’ve lost Maddie.’ Then the fire fighter came over 3 seconds later and was like, ‘We’ve got a pulse, we’ve got a pulse.’ They airlifted her… she’s hooked up on life support, breathing machines and all that… they come in, a priest to read her her last rights, and when they did, her body physically sat up, her spirit responded to it for whatever reason… She got better and better every day and walked out of the hospital. This has no repercussions. So that’s when I became Catholic. For about five minutes I thought I’d lost my daughter and then I was given the miracle of having her back. Jamie Lynn admitted: “My biggest fear was she was going to die thinking her momma wasn’t trying to save her.”                      Monday 27 November 2023 21:36 , Isobel Lewis Sam Thompson is imagining Jamie Lynn’s life in Louisiana. There’s a lot of crawfish involved in the fantasy, but turns out it’s not far off. “We’re from Louisiana, we love crawfish. My sister and all of us, we love crawfish so much, but [Britney] only wanted the good crawfish,” Jamie Lynn recalled. “So the company in Louisiana would have them overnighted in a box for her, in an ice chest… Even in Vegas, she’d have crawfish, [she’d be] eating crawfish in the Elton John suite. “You can imagine, it’s like the rednecks done come to town.”                      Monday 27 November 2023 21:34 , Isobel Lewis As pointed out by Nella, all the women in camp have now done a trial!

Monday 27 November 2023 21:30 , Isobel Lewis Josie and Danielle are doing well, with just one more star to get. It’s the big one, and they both have to lay face down and drop out of the tank. Josie goes first, followed by Danielle, earning them both two more stars. “I can’t believe I just did that!” Josie shouts from the air. She says she thought she was going to “pass out” at one point, but they got 10 out of 12 stars. Mega!                      Monday 27 November 2023 21:27 , Isobel Lewis So close! But they dropped this one, just as more critters are dropped on Josie and Danielle.                      Monday 27 November 2023 21:26 , Isobel Lewis “She’s on fire, the lass!” Ant says.

Monday 27 November 2023 21:24 , Isobel Lewis The first ball is an easy catch by Danielle, but then Josie drops the second one.
