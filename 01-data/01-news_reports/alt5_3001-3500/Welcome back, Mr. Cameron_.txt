Outside the doors of the Anglican parish of Emmanuel, on London's multicultural Harrow Road, a group of people - mostly women - chatted among themselves on Friday, clutching their shopping carts as they waited for the doors to open. Emmanuel Pantry (La Despensa Emmanuel) is a charity initiative that allows people to buy, for five pounds (about 5.70 euros), basic necessities worth about 20 (almost 23 euros). "For me and my family it has been saving our lives for years," admits Aisha, her hair covered by the Islamic hijab. Zhade, of Afro-Caribbean origin, nods and smiles. Fourteen years after David Cameron's Conservative government imposed austerity policies in the United Kingdom, designed to reduce public debt and recover from the 2008 crisis, the former prime minister has returned to the front line of politics - as head of the foreign portfolio in Rishi Sunak's government - to find a country that has still not recovered from the deterioration of public services and private pockets brought about by that policy. And paradoxically, Cameron's bailout is, moreover, an attempt to steer a Conservative Party completely transformed and radicalized by the Brexit that the former Prime Minister provoked in 2016 with a reckless referendum ill-conceived and of worse resolved, back to the center and moderation. "Austerity disappeared from the Conservative ideology in 2019, with Boris Johnson's electoral program in which he disavowed the concept and promised an increase in public investment, but we are still dragging the consequences of that," Anand Menon, professor of European Politics and Foreign Affairs at King's College London, and director of UK in a Changing Europe, the academic organization that continues to rigorously analyze the consequences of Brexit, explains to EL PAÍS. "The base on which we started to recover was very low, and we have not been able to make the necessary capital investment," he adds. It was the perfect storm. The pandemic arrived, and the British people had care services, especially public health care, reduced to the bone by the austerity measures of the Cameron years. That is why the figure of the former prime minister ended up becoming one of the most hated in the collective imagination of the British. "Cameron oozes failure from every pore of his skin. Brexit, Libya, the economy... all the problems our public services already had to deal with were compounded by years of austerity. Cameron's appointment as foreign secretary can only mean that Sunak is running out of rope," asserts philosopher and analyst John Gray in The New Statesman magazine. "Why on earth are they bringing back this loser, who is a leftover from the past,' the bulk of Conservative voters must be asking themselves," Gray finishes off. Nostalgia for a conservative past Rishi Sunak has a year ahead of him to try to overcome polls that are now devastating for the Tories. All of them give at least 20 percentage points of advantage to the Labor Party in a general election scheduled for the end of 2024. The Prime Minister, relatively new in politics and with a reputation as an effective technocrat, has played in recent months to cultivate an extreme right-wing message that, in theory, should please the ears of the party's rank and file and voters. The Brexit and Boris Johnson's electoral victory in 2019 ended up completely transforming a Conservative Party already slanted entirely towards populism, the anti-immigration and anti-Europe message, and a social authoritarianism of an almost reactionary cut totally at odds with what they define as woke: any denunciation of a colonial past, a latent institutional racism or an intolerant attitude towards gender policies. It was not Sunak's playing field, who in fact was increasingly overwhelmed by the "internal enemy": the former Minister of the Interior, Suella Braverman, backed by the hard wing of the Tories, increasingly brazenly led a rebellion against the Prime Minister which, after being expelled from the Government this week, she has elevated to a clear declaration of war. Faced with these moves, Sunak has finally chosen his cards. The incorporation of Cameron is a nod to those center-right voters, economically liberal and socially open, who felt orphaned by a radicalized Conservative Party. Cameron arrived at Downing Street with a team of collaborators belonging to cosmopolitan and modern urban elites. The Notting Hill Boys - alluding to London's chic neighborhood of restaurants and bookstores - sold a "compassionate conservatism," a defense of the environment and social advances such as gay marriage. Cameron was able to forge a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats in his first term, and won a surprising absolute majority in his second election, in 2015. But his finance minister, George Osborne, had already installed the seeds of dissatisfaction with the heavy-handed implementation of an austerity policy that took tens of billions of pounds in needed investment away from public services. "Austerity was never a necessity, but rather a very poor economic policy choice whose consequences have now been clearly exposed. Any return to further spending cuts, to rebound from the pandemic crisis, would impose another dramatic cost to a country that has barely recovered from the last round of cuts," warns Robert Calvert, professor at the University of Greenwich's Economic Policy Institute and author of a devastating report on the traces of austerity produced for the Progressive Economic Policy Forum. Calvert refers to the restrictive fiscal measures imposed by Sunak and his finance minister, Jeremy Hunt, to reverse the collapse of the UK's credibility caused by his predecessor, Liz Truss. After months of strikes by nurses, doctors, hauliers, railroad staff and teachers, the idea of restoring popularity with the man many point to as the main cause of a few years of hardship has a very short flight. It is true that Cameron has been appointed Foreign Secretary. He has no reason to influence the national policy debate in an election year. But putting at the helm of the UK's international image the person who isolated that island the most from its neighbors and partners, with the Brexit consultation of 2016, will not be to the liking of the core of Conservative voters in favor of remaining in the EU either. Economically, a bad memory. As an attempt to resurrect a Conservative Party that no longer exists, a mirage. Second chances are rarely good in politics. The only success achieved this week by Sunak, with his decision, has been to cover to some extent, for a few hours, the noise and fury of the rebellion led by Braverman with the exoticism and surprise that has meant for many Britons to see Cameron enter Downing Street again.
