   Why migrant arrivals to the UK have nearly tripled despite Brexit promises CE Noticias Financieras English June 5, 2023 Monday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

And they all ended their terms in office without achieving it. Reducing migration to the UK has been a constant commitment of the Conservative Party in the 13 years it has been in power. David Cameron and Theresa May spoke of bringing the figure down to "tens of thousands". Boris Johnson "learned the lesson of an overly specific promise" and simply stated that the numbers would go down after Brexit, notes Chris Mason, BBC political editor. However, Mason adds, the promises of all three politicians "were wiped out by reality." The rhetoric again clashed with the facts in the government of current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Net migration (people arriving in the UK minus those leaving) stood at 606,000 in 2022, according to data released in May by the British Office for National Statistics (ONS). The data are for people who arrived in the UK for at least 12 months. The figure represents an increase of 164,000 over the 2021 total. And it is almost triple the net migration in 2019, which was estimated at226,000. The pro-Brexit campaign promised first and foremost to regain control of the borders or "take back control", as the popular slogan of those who pushed for the exit from the European Union used to say. How can we explain then that almost 7 years after the Brexit vote, net migration is still on the rise?

Behind the rise are three main factors, according to ONS data and experts consulted by the BBC. 1-Internationalstudents The figure of 606,000 net migrants in 2022 results from subtracting 557,000 (those who left) from 1.2 million (those who arrived). Of that 1.2 million entrants, 925,000 came from outside the European Union. And of these, almost 40% arrived on student visas. "International students are a very important source of income for British universities," Mariña Fernández Reino, senior researcher at the Migration Observatory of the University of Oxford, told BBC Mundo. "Universities relied heavily on students from China, who were the vast majority of international students coming in recent years." "So the government promoted a diversification strategy so that, in case that flow of students went down, university admissions wouldn't suffer so much."

Peter Walsh, an expert at the same center at Oxford University, told the BBC that there have been initiatives by the government and the universities themselves to recruit students, for example, in India and Nigeria. "International students pay higher tuition fees that subsidize the education of local students in the UK," Walsh added. To attract students, the government introduced so-called "post study work" less than two years ago. "This means that if you come as an international student you can stay for two years working in any job, even if it is not related to what you have studied," explained Fernandez Reino. "That made the option of coming to the UK more attractive than what existed before, when you could come for a year but then you had to leave." Another factor that boosted the numbers is that students from India, Nigeria and other countries often come with their families. Fernandez Reino noted that "a high percentage come with dependents, with partners or with children. So this means that the number of people coming on student visas has increased a lot. Most of the students from China, on the other hand, came alone". Walsh told the BBC that last year international students brought "around 100,000 partners and children".

New restrictions for students The Rishi Sunak government recently announced limitations on the entry of students' dependents. Fernandez Reino explained that starting next  year,only those coming to pursue master's degrees or research doctorateswill be able to bring in dependents . "That of course is going to impact two things. One is that fewer will come, because only the student who enrolls will be able to do so. And another is that the change may make it less attractive to study in the U.K." "Research master's degrees are normally two years and are the ones that give access to a PhD program here. It's a very small percentage of master's degrees. And they have not been barred from bringing dependents because if you have a family you can't split four years." The Russell Group, which represents most of Britain's top universities, said the new restrictions will impact the ability of study centers to attract "the vital income" that international students bring. 2-Work visas The second largest driver of the increase in net migrants in 2022 was the number of workers from outside the European Union(EU). Their number nearly doubled from 137,000 to 235,000 in the space of a year. In the case of EU citizens, more people left the UK in 2022 (202,000) than arrived (151,000), according to the ONS.

Getty Images Care and health care workers were included in the skilled visas for the first time.        The increase in non-EU workers was primarily due to the extension of the skilled worker visa. That route, prior to Brexit, already allowed entry for skilled people sponsored by British companies or institutions, such as doctors or nurses. But in 2022 it included "more occupations that are often not considered fully skilled. The most important one is care workers with a bit of experience, what they call senior care workers, who can now come in and were previously excluded." "We are seeing that visas increased a lot because those workers coming with special visas for the health sector." The top three countries of origin for health care workers are India, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, according to ONS. Vidia Ruhomutally, who emigrated to the UK from Mauritius decades ago, owns a nursing home in Norfolk County, three hours from London. Ruhomutally told the BBC that she hires many of her workers in India. "Without India we wouldn't be here," she noted. "And without us, the local hospital would have busy beds that it couldn't free up for other patients."

The number of non-EU nationals arriving in the UK via humanitarian routes increased from 9% to 19% in 2022. In 2022, 114,000 Ukrainians and 52,000 Hong Kong nationals entered for at least 12 months. The latter were offered a special visa scheme after China imposed a national security law on the former British colony.

"The numbers are too high" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reacted to the figures released in May by insisting that migration is "not out of control." In a television interview on the day the data was released Sunak said, "The numbers are too high, it's as simple as that. And I want to reduce them." The net migration figure could go down in the future, according to Dominic Casciani, the BBC's home affairs and legal correspondent. "Inflows from Ukraine and Hong Kong are expected to cease and labor inflows may stabilize." On the other hand, "the outflow of international students should increase, while many new ones will no longer be able to bring their family members," Casciani added. For Fernández Reino, "it is always difficult to predict, there is uncertainty. But we are seeing from the data that came out for December 2022, compared to September, that migration has not continued to grow". As for inflows from Ukraine, "they were concentrated just in the months after the invasion and then have been gradually declining, although it is always difficult to make a forecast because it is true that there can be a very large deterioration in the conditions of the war."

For the expert, the influx of care and health workers could continue to increase, if there are no changes in the regulations. "We know there is a very big labor shortage in those two sectors. But even so, I think the overall numbers are going to go down because the number of people leaving will increase". On irregular migration, the government announced in 2022 a controversial plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. The initiative has not yet been implemented due to appeals to the British courts and an intervention by the European Court of Human Rights. For Dominic Casciani, the numbers entering the UK "could fall by another 70,000 people if the government's controversial plan to divert almost all asylum claims abroad works, but that's a conditional 'if' as big as the height of the Cliffs of Dover."

Costs and benefits Chris Mason points out that migration is much more than a question of numbers. It is also about "emotion, communities and public services. It's about promise, people and places. For Fernández Reino, it is important to keep in mind that often"politicians overestimate their ability to regulate migration flows". "Many times the capacity of politicians to be able to reduce these numbers is limited. Now they are going to try to do so with the issue of reducing the number of student dependents." The change may, however, come at great cost to universities. Migration measures often have a "heads and tails", adds Fernandez Reino. Reducing net migration "always benefits or hurts someone." "And even on the issue of irregular migration and asylum seekers, many times tightening measures don't have the intended effect of limiting people arriving."
