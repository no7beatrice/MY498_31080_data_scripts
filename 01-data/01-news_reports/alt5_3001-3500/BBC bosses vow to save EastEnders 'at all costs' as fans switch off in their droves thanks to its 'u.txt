   BBC bosses vow to save EastEnders 'at all costs' as fans switch off in their droves thanks to its 'unbearably woke' storylines - from 'Walford's own Greta Thunberg' to Sharon Watts likening Brexit to Covid MailOnline July 7, 2023 Friday 9:48 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:6 Length: 1706 words Byline: Katie Hind Consultant Editor Showbusiness Martin Robinson, Chief Reporter For Mailonline Body                        BBC bosses have vowed to save EastEnders 'at all costs', MailOnline has been told today, as viewers drift away claiming the soap has gone woke and lacks the East End family 'charm' of its past. There are fears for the show suffering its lowest ever viewing figures in recent years - as little as 1.3million - compared with 30million for its biggest episodes such as Christmas Day and 15million per episode after its launch.                      EastEnders' future has reportedly been ignited as fans have switched off in their droves over 'desperate' plots and woke storylines. This includes apparent snipes at Brexit and a focus on climate change and veganism. Others were also upset that popular characters such as Danny Dyer's character Mick Carter had left the soap. There have been bizarre moments such as Cindy Beale returning from the dead. But sources at the Beeb told MailOnline today that 'it is going nowhere' amid claims that the show's future is 'bleak'. The Beeb has recently spent £87million on a new set. One said: 'EastEnders still remains an institution as far as the BBC is concerned and the feedback is that young people are loving it. They were particularly glued to the recent pregnancy storyline where 11 year old Lily Slater announced she was having a baby. The figures are nowhere near what they were but as far as the bosses are concerned there is a huge appetite.' Here are some of the wokest moments of recent times:                       'Lecturing' on climate change and 'meat free Mondays' from schoolgirl branded soap's Greta Thunberg                    In 2021 schoolgirl character Bailey Baker stood outside Walford East station and urged the residents to sign a petition for meat-free Mondays.  She said: 'Global mass-produced industrial meat is killing the planet is literally killing the planet. One meat-free day a week is one step to saving the world. You need to start local, and think global. Small changes make a big difference.' 'Global livestock production makes a huge amount of greenhouse gases. They need to be reduced to save the planet. It causes deforestation and pollution. Don't you care that there are floods and droughts?' Later Bailey told residents of Albert Square: 'We need to cut down the amount of meat we eat to help save the planet before it's too late. The damage that has been done already is criminal. If we all stop eating meat for one day a week we can all help slow down climate change.' Her message was later tweeted by the official EastEnders' account, which drew criticism from viewers including several claiming this wokeness was why they no longer watch.                       Sharon compares Brexit to Covid and tells love rival: 'We don't need you here'                    Last year there was some upset when Brexit was likened to the Covid pandemic by Sharon Watts in EastEnders programme.  She threw a drink in rival Sam Michell's face and declared: 'We've had Brexit and Covid, we don't need you here'.  She continued: 'Go home Sam. There's something you should know about me sweetheart, I don't play so nice these days. Cross me and I'll put you down.'                      Polish worker says 'this is the Britain we live in now' after getting racist abuse post-Brexit                    EastEnders viewers were fuming at 'disgusting' Brexit-fuelled racism storyline on the BBC soap. Character Konrad Topolski was the subject of racism after 'Poles go home' was sprayed on the door of the Queen Vic in red paint. Mick Carter then removed it using a jet washer as Konrad said: 'This is the Britain we live in now'. The racism was rejected by viewers who accused the show's writers of a hamfisted attack on Brexit. One tweeted: 'Oh, look at that, a bit of Brexit related xenophobia. EastEnders.' 'Eastenders trying to do a racism story. Pathetic #BBC'                      £1,000 lip fillers gone wrong to make soap more 'relatable' to young people                                         EastEnders fans were left in shock when Tiffany Butcher-Baker's face swelled-up after she got bad filler injections.  The character, played by Maisie Smith, had spent over £1,000 on cosmetic work in a bid to impress her chef husband Keegan and his entourage.  In dramatic scenes, Maisie's character was seen with bruises on her cheek and her lips had become swollen.  Tiffany had lied to Keegan and claimed she was going for a facial before coming clean that she'd actually had the troublesome cosmetic procedure.  In a tense altercation afterwards, she wept as she told him: 'I got fillers. I just wanted to look my best. We're a brand now, I've got to be the same standard as everyone else.  'It's an investment - I'm doing this for us. It's fine, I'll pay them off - it was £800 today and £400 the first time.  Keegan lambasted her for getting the procedure and he criticised Tiffany for spending so much money trying to look like 'every next girl'.  BBC chiefs are clear that EastEnders will not be axed. One source also point out that EastEnders won all of the publicly voted for categories at the recent British Soap Awards, which is 'a big deal' for them. Danielle Harold won leading performer. Best Villain was Aaron Thiara. Lily Slater won best young performer and they then won Best Soap. Viewers have been put off by ludicrous plots such as soap legend Cindy Beale returning from the dead - which has been branded a 'desperate move' - while there are also claims that the stories have gone 'woke'.  In recent years there has been story lines with a focus on climate change and veganism, with mentions of Greta Thunberg. Critics have pointed out that the majority of EastEnders' viewers are over 50 - and the vast majority are over 65, according to research, and probably have other interests. Peter Dean, who played Pete Beale for 20 years, said EastEnders had gone too far from its roots - and had too many characters.  He said in 2020: 'We started off with 15 characters, maybe one or two more, now you get people turn up and you don't see them for about five weeks. Then they turn back up in it for a couple of weeks and then they disappear again. 'Its charm was actual families, now it's families but they're all arguing, people just want to see the comedy of it and that, or the social comment of it, now everyone is having a row with this one or shouting at this one.' He added: 'The writers now, they just want to know about rapes and what goes on in the world and people arguing and fighting.' The decision to build an eye-watering £87million new set is also said to have come under scrutiny on the show. And now, according to The Sun, it's said to be a 'worrying time' for EastEnders, with bleak predictions that viewers may be watching the 'final days' of the BBC soap. A source told the publication: 'It's a worrying time for EastEnders. 'It used to be the show which everybody was talking about but it's now in a precarious position where older viewers are switching off, and younger viewers have no interest. 'Bringing back presumed dead characters is a desperate move which rarely works, but EastEnders is really running out of options. We could be watching its final years.' Despite the concerns, an insider said: 'EastEnders still remains an institution as far as the BBC is concerned and the feedback is that young people are loving it... 'They were particularly glued to the recent pregnancy storyline where 11-year-old Lily Slater announced she was having a baby. The figures are nowhere near what they were but as far as the bosses are concerned there is a huge appetite.' A spokesman for EastEnders told MailOnline: 'EastEnders episodes are made live to the audience at 6am every morning on BBC iPlayer giving the audience the choice to watch when and where they choose. 'So when episodes are moved to a different day, or channel, due to a live sporting event it is no surprise that this is reflected in the regular overnight audience... 'Over the last two weeks EastEnders has been streamed almost 18million times on BBC iPlayer and remains one of iPlayer's most popular programmes.' EastEnders shocked viewers last month as Cindy Beale came back from the dead and Michelle Collins reprised her role after 25 years. It emerged that she'd been in witness protection after her former cell mate wanted her dead - with Cindy also revealed to be George Knight's long-lost wife 'Rose', who's been hiding out in France with her ex Ian Beale. However, despite the shocking twist, The Sun claims that Executive Producer Chris Clenshaw's 'desperate move' of being her back failed to spark 'the desired upturn'. With actress Michelle herself saying she thought it was a 'ridiculous idea' upon first hearing the plot. And figures show that the BBC drama is struggling to compete with ITV rivals Emmerdale and Coronation Street, who regularly draw in four millions fans. The soap has also reportedly had big name former stars sharing criticism over storylines, with Mick Carter actor Danny Dyer previously stating of his character: 'I didn't quite know who I was playing any more.' He noted that he'd had several people ask him over the years if he was still in the soap as they no longer watched it. Elsewhere, Heather Trott actress Cheryl Ferguson was said to have claimed that the show was no longer 'relatable' as it was too violent.  It comes as it's been revealed that the soap's writers have got some viciously dynamite fights planned between the Cindy and her former mother-in-law, Kathy Beale - played by Gillian Taylforth. They infamously despised one another after Cindy cheated on Kathy's son Ian with David Wickes - and now EastEnders executive producer Chris Clenshaw has described the moment they come face to face 26 years after Cindy left as 'absolute dynamite'. Chris said: 'Cindy's a little softer through everything that has gone on, after 25 years of living a different identity and living a lie to her other family... 'What comes quite apparent later in the year when she returns to Walford is it doesn't take long before we see flashes of the old Cindy Beale and she still has it, there's some absolute dynamite between Cindy and Kathy... 'It doesn't take long and it's still the same Cindy at the core, she's just been on one hell of a journey since we last saw her.' Load-Date: July 7, 2023  End of Document
