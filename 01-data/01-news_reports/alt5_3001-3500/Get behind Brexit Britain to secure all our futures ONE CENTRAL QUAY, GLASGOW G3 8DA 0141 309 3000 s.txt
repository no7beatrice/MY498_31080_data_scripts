   Get behind Brexit Britain to secure all our futures; ONE CENTRAL QUAY, GLASGOW G3 8DA 0141 309 3000 scotexpress@express.co.uk EDITED, PRINTED AND PUBLISHED IN SCOTLAND Scottish Express July 8, 2023 Saturday Edition 1, Scotland  Copyright 2023 Express Newspapers All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 14 Length: 233 words Body   BREXIT has brought enormous benefits to the United Kingdom. It allowed us to press ahead with lockdown-ending Covid vaccinations and to lead the way in supporting Ukraine. We've joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a huge trading bloc including Japan, Canada and Australia, while retaining free trade with our EU partners. Despite gloomy predictions during the Brexit referendum, there are no tariffs and no quotas on British-made goods exported to the EU. The threat of being forced to give up our independent foreign policy, or join an "ever closer union" controlled by an unelected European Commission, has been lifted. And this is just the start. It may feel as if we've been discussing Brexit forever, but the UK only left the EU in 2020. Despite the best efforts of MPs such as David Jones, writing in today's Express, we don't hear as much about the benefits of Brexit as we should. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak must talk up Brexit, and Britain, to offer a positive vision for this country's future.And he should remember that this approach gave the Tories a stunning election win in 2019. We're in a tough period, but the British people aren't daft.They know global events have given economies a battering.They want to know who has the ideas and the enthusiasm to lead us to better times. Many voters aren't impressed with Sir Keir Starmer, but they need to hear good reasons to stick with the Tories. Load-Date: July 8, 2023  End of Document
