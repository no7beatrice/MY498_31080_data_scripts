   Jaguar Land Rover picks UK for battery factory Scottish Express July 19, 2023 Wednesday Edition 1, Scotland  Copyright 2023 Express Newspapers All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 8 Length: 215 words Byline: Steph Spyro ; David Maddox Body   TOP Tories declared a huge Brexit victory as Jaguar Land Rover bosses picked Britain for a new multi-billion pound electric car battery plant. The Somerset factory, to be announced today, is set to create 9,000 jobs and help secure the future of UK electric vehicle production. Britain plans to end sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. The Government, which will provide £500million in subsidies, is understood to have pipped Spain in its bid for the factory. Former Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg said: "This was only able to happen because we are free to help JLR without being bound by the EU's state aid rules." Tory MP Marco Longhi added: "Brexit Britain is beginning to deliver. "The transition out of the EU was always going to be sluggish and bumpy, but neither did we think that the EU would be as difficult as it has been. "This investment has only been possible because of Brexit." Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis said: "This is excellent news for the UK. Car batteries have a key role to play in the future of green transport." Some experts have described the Jaguar Land Rover plant as the most significant UK automotive investment since car giant Nissan came to Britain in the 1980s. MP Sir Simon Clarke called the battery factory "serious good news" for the country. Graphic    Electric dreams…Jaguar I-PACE Load-Date: October 26, 2023  End of Document
