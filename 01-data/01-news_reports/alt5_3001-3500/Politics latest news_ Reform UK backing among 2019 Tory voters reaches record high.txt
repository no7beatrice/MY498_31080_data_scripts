   Politics latest news: Reform UK backing among 2019 Tory voters reaches record high telegraph.co.uk January 30, 2024 Tuesday 4:01 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 4610 words Byline: By Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor Body   The percentage of 2019 Tory voters who now say they intend to vote for Reform UK has increased to its highest ever level, according to a new Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll.  The survey, conducted on Jan 28, found 47 per cent of 2019 Conservative supporters said they would vote the same way if a general election were held tomorrow.  But 19 per cent said they would vote for Reform and another 19 per cent said they would vote for Labour.  The Reform number was up by one point when compared to the company’s previous poll conducted on Jan 21. Redfield & Wilton Strategies said the latest backing for Reform among 2019 Tory voters was a “record high in our polling”. The numbers illustrate the potential electoral threat to the Tories posed by Reform as Rishi Sunak tries to steer the Conservative Party to its fifth general election victory in a row.

The DUP leader told broadcasters in Stormont this afternoon: “I look forward to the publication so that finally people will be able to see the extent of what has been achieved by the DUP in delivering that change for Northern Ireland.”  Sir Jeffrey said he believed the DUP had secured “significant” changes to GB-NI trading arrangements and “there will no longer be physical checks or identity checks, save where as is normal in any part of the UK there is a suspicion of smuggling, of criminal activity and that is the same for every part of the United Kingdom”.                       30 Jan 2024-03:35PM GMT                                         Poll: Labour lead Tories in all voter age groups but one                    Labour lead the Tories among every age group of voters apart from the over-70s, according to YouGov.  The company looked at data collected between October 31 and January 17 to determine the voting intention for different age groups.  It found that in the over-70s group, the Conservatives were backed by 43 per cent of people, with Labour in second place on 23 per cent.

In a statement, a spokesman for Mr Varadkar said: “Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had a good call with the UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak today about the restoration of the powersharing institutions in Northern Ireland. “The Taoiseach and Prime Minister welcomed the developments overnight, and both leaders said they hope this paves the way for the early restoration of the Northern Ireland executive and the assembly, and that North-South Ministerial meetings will resume again. They agreed to keep in touch over the coming period.”                      30 Jan 2024-02:38PM GMT                                         Lib Dems and Labour criticise Tory economic record after IMF warning                     Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have responded to the International Monetary Fund’s warning about the affordability of future tax cuts (see the post below at 14.16).  Labour’s Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “This is yet more evidence of 14 years of Conservative economic failure. The Tories have left Britain with high debt, flatlining growth, high taxes and working people worse off. “It’s time for change. We need an election now to give the British public the chance to vote for a changed Labour Party that will change Britain for the better.” Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury spokesman, said: “The IMF’s damning verdict confirms that this Conservative Government is mismanaging our economy in the worst way, condemning the UK to years of sluggish growth. “For all the Prime Ministers and Chancellors that have changed, the Conservative party’s failed approach to our economy has stayed the same.”                      30 Jan 2024-02:16PM GMT                                         Hunt vows to forge ahead with tax cuts despite IMF warning                    Jeremy Hunt has vowed to forge ahead with tax cuts even as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned Britain’s growing debt pile and ageing population meant they were unaffordable. The Chancellor insisted “smart tax reductions” would boost the British economy as the IMF predicted a rapid drop in inflation would pave the way for the Bank of England to cut interest rates twice this year. Mr Hunt was forced to defend his tax-cutting plans following the IMF rebuke, as officials at the Fund also suggested a post-election departmental spending squeeze was unrealistic and was not included in its own forecasts.

Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, said: “The higher net migration figures reflect 14 years of Conservative failure on the economy and immigration. The Tories’ record high net migration figures include a 65 per cent increase in net migration for work and a 156 per cent surge in health and social care visas as a result of their failure on skills, training and domestic workforce planning here in the UK.  “Labour would reform the points-based immigration system to boost training and better link it to the needs of the economy.”                       30 Jan 2024-01:23PM GMT                                         Return of Stormont a 'long time coming', says Sinn Fein leader                     Mary Lou McDonald, the leader of Sinn Fein, welcomed the prospect of Stormont getting back up and running.  She told a press conference: “It has been a long time coming but we are very pleased that we are at this juncture.  “We are conscious that there is a huge amount of work to be done, that society has really suffered from the absence of government over the last two years.  “We are almost two years away from the last assembly election. I very much welcome the fact that the DUP have now moved to explicitly recognise and respect the outcome of that assembly election.”                       30 Jan 2024-01:11PM GMT                                         ‘All the conditions are now in place’ for Stormont to return, says NI Secretary                     Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland Secretary, said he believed “all the conditions are now in place” for Stormont to return. He told a press conference in Westminster: “As agreed with Sir Jeffrey (Donaldson, the DUP leader), and subject to the finalisation of all-party talks today, I will tomorrow publish the details of the proposal we have made to secure Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market and to strengthen the union. “I believe that all the conditions are now in place for the assembly to return. I look forward very much to the restoration of the institutions as soon as possible. “There was a financial package worth over £3 billion offered to the parties before Christmas. This will absolutely be available to an incoming executive. “The parties entitled to form an executive are meeting today to discuss these matters and I hope we will be able to finalise this deal with those parties as soon as possible and move forward.”                      30 Jan 2024-01:08PM GMT                                         No10 ‘open’ to strengthening minimum service level rules                     Downing Street said the Government will consider if they can “strengthen” minimum service level (MSL) rules after train operators opted not to use the new law during the latest wave of rail strikes. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “This is something that the rail companies have asked for and we have delivered it for them. “We believe they should be ready to use the legislation to reduce the impact of rail strikes on passengers, but we are always open to looking at how we can strengthen the rules around MSLs to ensure they deliver for the best interests of passengers. “That’s something we will continue to look at and of course we will keep discussing with the rail companies themselves.” The minimum service level powers allow train companies to insist workers provide a specific level of service during walkouts to minimise disruption for passengers.                      30 Jan 2024-01:05PM GMT                                         Cleverly unveils timetable for rolling out measures to curb legal migration                    James Cleverly, the Homes Secretary, has set out the timeframe for introducing new measures designed to curb legal migration numbers.  Mr Cleverly said he had been “clear that migration is too high and we must get back to sustainable levels”.  The measures and timelines include:                                                                       Into force March 11: Reforms that will restrict care workers from bringing dependants and require care providers to register with the Care Quality Commission if they are sponsoring migrants to come to the UK.                                                Into force March 14: New immigration rules will be put in place which will include removing the 20 per cent going rate discount for occupations on the shortage occupation list (the going rate currently lowers the salary threshold for people filling those roles).                                                Into force April 4: A new increase to the minimum salary required for those arriving on the Skilled Worker visa, from £26,200 to £38,700.                                                Into force April 11: The minimum income requirement threshold for family visas will rise in stages, starting at £29,000.                                                              30 Jan 2024-12:36PM GMT                                         Urgent question to be asked in Commons on sale of The Telegraph                    A senior Tory MP has been granted an urgent question in the House of Commons on the proposed takeover of The Telegraph.  Alicia Kearns, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, has asked for a statement to be made by ministers on the proposed sale of the newspaper to the Abu Dhabi-backed RedBird IMI investment fund. Lucy Frazer, the Culture Secretary, recently ordered a further investigation into the attempted takeover by RedBird IMI, a fund that is 75 per cent funded by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the vice president of the UAE.                      30 Jan 2024-11:58AM GMT                                         Sunak feeling confident ahead of election despite Tories' polling woes                     Rishi Sunak insisted he is feeling confident ahead of the next general election despite the Tories languishing behind Labour in the opinion polls.  The Prime Minister refused to give any more specifics about when the next election could take place as he repeated that his “working assumption” is that it will be in the second half of 2024.  Asked during an appearance on ITV’s This Morning programme when the election will be and if he believed the Tories will win it, Mr Sunak said: “I’ve been very clear. We have been through a tough time over the past year as a country, still dealing with the legacy of Covid backlogs in the NHS for example, war in Ukraine, energy bills. But I really believe that this year, at the start of this year, we have turned a corner and we are heading in the right direction. And the plan we have put in place is working and you can see that most obviously with the economy.”  Asked again when the election will be, he said: “That I have already said, the working assumption about that.”  Finally, asked if he was feeling confident, the Prime Minister replied: “I am. Yeah, absolutely.” Labour has maintained a comfortable double digit poll lead over the Conservatives in recent months.                       30 Jan 2024-11:48AM GMT                                         Government giving police 'powers they need' to tackle knife crime, says PM                    Rishi Sunak said that “every life that is lost is a life too many” as he was grilled about the Government’s efforts to tackle knife crime.  The Prime Minister said the Government was ensuring there are more police officers and that those police officers are given the “powers that they need”.  Asked if he believed people respect the police in the UK, Mr Sunak replied: “Yeah, I do.”                      30 Jan 2024-11:42AM GMT                                         No 'magic money tree' for junior doctor pay rises, says Sunak                     Rishi Sunak said “we don’t have a magic money tree” after he was asked why the Government was not offering junior doctors a higher pay rise.  The Prime Minister told ITV’s This Morning programme that “we have to be fair to everybody” as he pointed to pay deals being agreed across a variety of other public services.  Junior doctors are yet to agree a new pay deal amid a long-running standoff with the Government.                       30 Jan 2024-11:39AM GMT                                         PM admits Government needs to do better job on GP appointments                     Rishi Sunak said “we do need to do a better job of that” when it comes to increasing the availability of GP appointments.  The Prime Minister said that from tomorrow people will be able to see a pharmacist for help with seven common ailments.  Asked about the potential for people to be misdiagnosed by a pharmacist, Mr Sunak told ITV’s This Morning programme that they are “incredibly highly trained”.                      30 Jan 2024-11:34AM GMT                                         Sunak: Fasting provides a 'little reset' at the start of the week                    Rishi Sunak described his much publicised decision to fast at the start of each week as a “little reset”.  The Prime Minister, appearing on ITV’s This Morning programme, said he had now broken his fast, joking that he had “already had my second pastry today”.  Mr Sunak said “I wish I was as disciplined as has been reported” and that he tried every Monday “after an indulgent weekend to try to have a day of fasting”.  But he admitted he would occasionally have a snack during his fast.                      30 Jan 2024-11:28AM GMT                                         Jenrick: Immigration fuelling population growth will not create united country                    Robert Jenrick said an almost 10 per cent projected increase in the UK population, overwhelmingly driven by immigration, is “not how you create a united country”.  The former immigration minister has responded to today’s population projection published by the Office for National Statistics (see the post below at 10.12).  He said annual net migration in the hundreds of thousands will “only deepen the housing crisis”.  He argued that “there is no democratic consent for this outcome” and the “pace of change is far too fast”.  2/There is no democratic consent for this outcome.

He told a reception in London yesterday evening that the move would help to make a two-state solution – currently stalled with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, opposed to it – an “irreversible” process. Lord Cameron discussed the need to give the “Palestinian people a political horizon” under efforts to end the Israeli-Hamas war as he addressed a reception for Arab ambassadors in Parliament. Meanwhile, the Tory peer will pledge that Britain will “do everything” it can to prevent the conflict from “spilling over borders” during a visit to the Middle East today.                       30 Jan 2024-10:52AM GMT                                         Poll: Public expectation of Labour election win hits new high                    Public expectation of a Labour general election victory has hit a new high, according to the latest Redfield & Wilton Strategies survey.  A poll conducted on Jan 28 found 58 per cent of people believe either a Labour majority (45 per cent) or minority (13 per cent) government would be the most likely outcome if an election was held in the next six months. Redfield & Wilton Strategies said that this was “the highest percentage to say they would expect such an election to result in a Labour government that we’ve recorded”.  Less than a quarter – 23 per cent – expect a Tory victory. Some 15 per cent said a Tory majority would be the most likely outcome and eight per cent said a minority administration.

The Office for National Statistics published its latest national population projections this morning.  It said that over the 15 years from mid-2021 and mid-2036, the UK population is projected to grow by 6.6 million people – 9.9 per cent. That would take the population from an estimated 67 million to 73.7 million.  The ONS said this includes 541,000 more births than deaths and net international migration of 6.1 million people.                      30 Jan 2024-10:02AM GMT                                         Tice tells Tories to ‘stand aside’ for Reform UK at next election                     The Conservatives should “stand aside” for Reform UK at the next general election, Richard Tice said this morning.  It was suggested to the Reform leader during an appearance on Jeremy Vine on Channel 5 that his party could take votes from the Tories and hand victory to Labour.  He said: “The whole point of democracy is if people have got a view as to how the country should be run you put it out there.  “We stand in every single seat. Our view is look, the Tories have had their chance, we stood aside for them in 2019, gave them an 80 seat majority, they have completely blown it, they have messed up, they have broken the country.  “Frankly, they should now stand aside, if they had any moral decency and say ‘we are so sorry, we messed up’ and actually let me take on Keir Starmer and I tell you head-to-head we win 24/7, seven days a week.”                       30 Jan 2024-09:47AM GMT                                         Farage ‘sitting on the touchlines’ at election ‘least likely option’, says Tice                    Richard Tice suggested Nigel Farage will ultimately decide to return to the political frontline to help Reform UK at the next general election.  Mr Farage, the party’s honorary president, has not ruled out a return to the frontline but is yet to announce a final decision.  Mr Tice, the Reform leader, said this morning that he believed Mr Farage “sitting on the touchlines” at the next election “is the least likely option”.  Asked during an appearance on Jeremy Vine on Channel 5 if he was annoyed at constantly being asked about Mr Farage, Mr Tice replied: “No, not at all actually. We are going up in the polls, we are now at 13 per cent and I have been very clear that if Nigel can give some help, the more the better frankly.  “We speak weekly, he is our honorary president and he has got a big decision to make. I think the likelihood of him, given the state of the country, everybody knows the country is broken, the likelihood of him actually sort of just sitting on the touchlines is the least likely option.”                      30 Jan 2024-09:27AM GMT                                         Tice predicts autumn election as Sunak knows he will ‘lose and lose badly’                    Richard Tice said he believed the general election will take place in the autumn of this year because Rishi Sunak will want to stay as Prime Minister for as long as possible.  The Reform UK leader told Jeremy Vine on Channel 5 this morning: “We will be ready whenever there is a general election, there will be one this year for certain.  “We think it will be in the autumn. If you are the Prime Minister with all the prestige that goes with that, why would you give up a job early when you know you are going to lose and lose badly?  “So yes, we are on an election footing, we are getting ready and onwards and upwards.”                      30 Jan 2024-09:05AM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak’s net zero targets are ‘path to ruin’, says leading Tory MP                    Rishi Sunak is putting Britain on a “path to ruin” with his pursuit of net zero targets, the leader of an influential Tory group has warned. Craig Mackinlay accused the Prime Minister of overseeing a “shameful acceptance of decline” in the name of the green agenda.

He said a two per cent cut to National Insurance which took effect this month “very much is the start”.  Mr Holden told GB News: “There’s no point in doing a tax cut which then either gets eaten up by inflation or isn’t sustainable in the long term.  “We’ve seen the start of that, and it very much is the start, with the two per cent off national insurance.  “And I’m sure we’re going to see more of that down the line in the March budget and going forwards.”                      30 Jan 2024-08:23AM GMT                                         Ministers cautiously optimistic Stormont will return after DUP agrees deal                    The Government is cautiously optimistic that power-sharing at Stormont will now be restored after the DUP agreed to a deal late last night.   The deal relates to the removal of post-Brexit trade checks in the Irish Sea and is subject to new legislation being passed in parliament and an agreement on its timetable.  Lee Rowley, the housing minister, said the deal was “tentatively good news”. Asked if he was “cautiously optimistic”, he told Sky News: “Hopefully, yes. We believe in devolution. We want devolution to work whether it is in Northern Ireland or elsewhere.  “We want the assembly back, we want the executive back, we hope it will be successful but there are still a few more steps to go.”                      30 Jan 2024-08:17AM GMT                                         Small boat crossings should be labelled ‘national security crisis’, says Farage                     Rishi Sunak should designate the small boats situation in the English Channel a “national security crisis”, Nigel Farage has argued.  The former leader of the Brexit Party said the approach to the crossings should be reevaluated because people are entering the UK “often from war torn areas” and without documentation. He told GB News: “I personally believe we need to rethink the English Channel crisis. I think we need to absolutely rebrand it as a national security crisis.  “Tens of thousands of young men coming into our country, often from places that are not even friends of ours, often from war torn areas, without documentation.  “We have no idea whether some of them were even fighting for ISIS in Syria. I think this is a question of national security and that is the right approach going forwards.”                      30 Jan 2024-08:13AM GMT                                         Archbishop of Canterbury wrong over small boats crisis, suggests Nigel Farage                    Nigel Farage has criticised Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, over comments he made about small boat crossings and the Government’s Rwanda Bill.  The Most Rev Welby said yesterday that “we can as a nation do better” than the Bill as he said the legislation paving the way for migrant deportation flights to take off is “damaging for our nation’s unity”. But Mr Farage said the Most Rev Welby had not offered any alternative “whatsoever”.  The former leader of the Brexit Party told GB News: “He talks about unity. I tell you what, Archbishop, if there was a referendum on this, there would be real unity because a very large majority would say that those that cross illegally shouldn’t be allowed to stay. They shouldn’t be coming via this route. “But he says we can do better and yet I don’t hear him offer any alternative, whatsoever.” Load-Date: January 30, 2024  End of Document
