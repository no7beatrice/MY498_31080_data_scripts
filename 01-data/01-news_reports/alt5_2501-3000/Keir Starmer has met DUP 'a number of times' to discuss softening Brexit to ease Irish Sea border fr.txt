   Keir Starmer has met DUP 'a number of times' to discuss softening Brexit to ease Irish Sea border friction MailOnline October 13, 2023 Friday 3:42 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 628 words Byline: James Tapsfield, Political Editor For Mailonline Body   Keir Starmer has been in talks with the DUP about the prospect of softening Brexit, it was revealed today. The unionists' leader Jeffrey Donaldson said there had been discussions with Sir Keir about solutions to ease friction in trade between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland. However, speaking ahead of the DUP conference he insisted he was focused on securing a deal with the current Government that would allow his party to return to the Stormont Assembly. Labour has been vowing to restore close ties with the EU if Sir Keir wins the next election, although he has stressed that does not mean rejoining the single market or customs union.                      Tories have warned that the Opposition has an agenda of unwinding Brexit.  Rishi Sunak agreed the Windsor Framework with European commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier this year, arguing that the new terms solve the problems caused for Northern Ireland by the original Brexit deal.  However, DUP has refused to get behind the package and is refusing to participate in powersharing until its concerns are addressed. Sir Jeffrey said the Northern Ireland Protocol must be replaced with arrangements that 'respect and protect' the region's ability to trade within the UK and its internal market. Talks have been ongoing between the DUP and the Government for months but speculation has heightened in recent weeks that they may be close to concluding. Sir Jeffrey confirmed his party has had 'a number of conversations' with both Sir Keir Starmer and shadow secretary of state Hilary Benn. He described them as 'interesting discussions', adding: 'Labour does have a plan in terms of how it will deal with some of the issues that confront us, including on EU regulations and veterinary agreements'. 'If Labour were to proceed on the basis they have spoken of, for the United Kingdom as a whole, that would help to ease many of the difficulties that we have in moving goods, particularly from Great Britain to Northern Ireland,' he told the BBC on Friday. But he insisted he is working to get an agreement now with the current Government. 'I don't want to wait another year. If we can get this right now, if we can have measures that respect our economic rights as part of the United Kingdom, that restore our place in the UK internal market, why wouldn't I take that now?' he said. He added: 'Realistically, if we reach the end of the year, we're into the trajectory for a general election and I think it is likely in those circumstances Government are going to focus elsewhere. That's why I'm keen to make every effort that we can to get agreement. I don't know if that's going to be possible but I will continue working at this to try and get that solution.' Speaking before his party's conference this weekend, Sir Jeffrey said he will update members on the talks with the Government. Asked if they are close to a deal, Sir Jeffrey declined to speculate on a timeline, saying: 'Nothing is certain when it comes to negotiations of this nature but we have made progress.' The DUP withdrew first minister Paul Givan from the Stormont executive in February 2022 in protest against the internal UK trade barriers created by Brexit's Northern Ireland Protocol. Powersharing is unable to function in Northern Ireland without the participation of the largest unionist party. The UK and EU agreed the framework earlier this year in a bid to address unionist concerns about the protocol, but the DUP has indicated it will not return to the Stormont Assembly until the Government provides further assurances over Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market. One of the main parts of the framework - the green/red lane system for the movement of goods - became operational at Northern Ireland ports earlier this month.
