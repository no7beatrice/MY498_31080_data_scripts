   Scotgov: Scotland 'losing 3bn a year of public revenue due to Brexit' Herald Scotland June 23, 2023 Friday  Copyright 2023 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Length: 402 words Byline: Jody Harrison Body   Brexit has led to an expected loss of 3 billion a year to public revenues in Scotland, the Scottish Government has claimed. It has published a new paper to mark the seventh anniversary of the referendum on the UK-s membership of the European Union, which sets out the consequences of the vote. While almost two-thirds of Scots voted to remain in the EU, the UK as a whole narrowly opted to leave. As well as the loss of public revenue, the Scottish Government paper claims leaving the European Union is responsible for about a third of the -rampant- food price inflation currently being experienced across the UK.

Some 45% of tourism businesses in the Highlands and islands are dealing with staff shortages as a result of the UK quitting the EU, the paper claimed. Constitution Secretary Angus Robertson also highlighted the -hundreds of millions of pounds- of European funding that have been lost to Scotland-s rural and research sectors. Mr Robertson said: -Seven years after people in Scotland resoundingly rejected Brexit, the Scottish Government has published a paper that lays clear the damage it has inflicted. -Brexit means Scotland has now left the world-s biggest single market and no longer enjoys freedom of movement, resulting in labour shortages across the NHS, agriculture, and our hospitality sector. -Consumers and businesses continue to face a cost-of-living crisis driven by rampant food inflation, while produce rots in the ground, and obstructive trade barriers that are making it harder to import and export goods from the EU. -Scotland-s rural and research sectors have lost out on hundreds of millions of pounds worth of EU funding, which the UK Government has been unable to match.
