   Picardo renews fourth mandate in Gibraltar CE Noticias Financieras English October 14, 2023 Saturday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC. All Rights Reserved Copyright 2023 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved Length: 731 words Body          Fabian Picardo renews the post of chief minister of Gibraltar for a fourth term after the socialist coalition he leads, GSLP/Lib, won yesterday the elections held on the Rock in the exceptional context of the final stretch of the Brexit negotiations. Since the British bet on leaving the EU in 2016, the Rock - whose "border" with Spain, along with that of Ireland is the only land now linking the UK with the community bloc - has been in limbo. The aim is to abolish controls at the fence, but negotiations are proving complicated. During the election campaign, Picardo insisted that, having been in the talks from the beginning, he knew all the ins and outs, so changing interlocutor now would be a bad option. With a turnout of 76.41%, the socialist alliance GSLP/Lib won 9 of the 17 members of the Gibraltarian parliament, which allows it to form a government for a fourth legislature. However, beyond a Brexit that the Yanites did not want, the pandemic, the problems in primary health care and the delays in the construction of official development have been wearing down the socialist leader, so the victory was far from guaranteed. The polls of the last few days were extremely close so it was not ruled out that he could lose to the GSD conservatives led by Keith Azopardi. In his first speech after being re-elected, Picardo yesterday sent a message to the acting Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez. "It is time for you too to form a government and finish the agreement we started," he said. Earlier this year, for a moment, it was thought that the announcement of white smoke for a post-Brexit agreement on Gibraltar would be immediate. After London and Brussels managed to put an end to the controversy over the Northern Ireland Protocol in February, with all the complexities that this entails for a territory of difficult coexistence between Catholics and Protestants, it was thought that the necessary momentum would be achieved to resolve the only stumbling block that remains to be closed of the historic divorce. But the negotiations ended up running aground and the elections in Spain have left them at a standstill. Political paralysis benefits no one. The Brexit forces Madrid and the Rock to find a pragmatic solution of coexistence. Around 30,000 people cross the fence every day. Among them, 15,000 workers, of whom 10,000 are Spaniards from an area such as Campo de Gibraltar, where unemployment rarely drops below 30%. On New Year's Eve 2020, a few hours before the end of the Brexit transition period, London and Madrid managed to close "in extremis" an agreement in principle to avoid the strict controls at the border. The text contained the guidelines to close a treaty between the European Commission and the United Kingdom on the Rock. But it is only a temporary solution that can be rescinded at any time and that could have a different course depending on whether the PP or PSOE finally governs in Spain. If you want flexibility in the fence, the Schengen border must be outsourced to the port and airport of the Rock. But that requires the presence of agents from Spain (Schengen member). And therein lies the "crux" of the matter. Especially considering that the land where the airport is built was not contemplated in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713-1715). The British took it over in the 19th century, when epidemics forced the population to move to the isthmus. In the negotiations there is talk of "a zone of shared prosperity", a euphemism to avoid talking about sovereignty over the British colony. But it is sovereignty, after all, that has set the context for the last 300 years. And the issue that, in the end, now hinders the longed-for white smoke. Nobody wants to close a fence that would shake both the economy of the Rock and the surrounding Spanish regions. But, at the same time, nobody wants to sign any term, any point, any comma that could affect the sovereignty issue in an international treaty. In Brussels, there is an interest in getting the negotiations to move forward. In any case, there is a desire to give its place to Spain which, as a member of the bloc, after Brexit managed to get the EU to guarantee it veto power for any pact reached regarding the Rock. Likewise, Madrid got the EU to mention, for the first time, Gibraltar as a colony, thus joining the criteria that the UN has maintained on the territory since 1967.
