   Cornish EU rejoin supporters march across London Cornish & Devon Post October 13, 2023  Copyright 2023 Tindle News  All Rights Reserved  Section: EUROPEAN UNION NEWS, UK news & LONDON NEWS Length: 282 words Body   Cornish EU rejoining supporters from Penzance, Truro, Victoria and Launceston took part in a march across London.  The march went from Park Lane to Parliament Square, waving banners, chanting and singing campaign songs through the streets of the capital. Members left at 4am from Penzance with pick-up points at Truro, Victoria and Launceston.  Howard Farmer the chair of Cornwall for Europe: "It was great to be with so many others who believe that Brexit has been a disaster.  "In Cornwall we have seen our fish exports to Europe decimated, the supply of seasonal labour has dried up and imported goods, such as spare parts for machinery, have longer delivery times and freight charges.  "A big majority of people would now vote to reverse this failed Brexit." Beverley Haigh-Jones has been organising street stalls for Cornwall for Europe for several weeks.  She said: "We are gaining in membership and meeting many people who now regret voting leave in 2016. The campaign continues to grow in strength as the results of Brexit become clearer and clearer." One of the local marchers was Pam White from St Austell  whose banner read 'Hell hath no fury like a woman against Brexit'.  Pam said: "I think the worst problem with Brexit is that it has restricted our freedom to live and work in Europe, as well as the travel restrictions at borders and how long you can stay abroad."
