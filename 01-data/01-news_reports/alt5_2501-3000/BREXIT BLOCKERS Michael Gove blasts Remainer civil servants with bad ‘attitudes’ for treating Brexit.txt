   BREXIT BLOCKERS Michael Gove blasts Remainer civil servants with bad ‘attitudes’ for treating Brexit like a ‘big mistake’ thesun.co.uk June 2, 2023 Friday 1:16 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS,BREXIT,CONSERVATIVE PARTY,UK POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 243 words Byline: Noa Hoffman Body   MICHAEL Gove today launched a spectacular attack on Remainer civil servants for treating Brexit like a “big mistake”. The Levelling Up Secretary  revealed some Whitehall officials continue to be bitter about Britain’s divorce from Brussels.  He told the Crisis What Crisis podcast  that across the civil service there’s “a sense that Brexit  was a big, historic mistake”. And he admitted sour partisan feelings are slowing down the ministers from making positive policy changes.  Mr Gove said: “If we fast-forward to now, I think one of the issues inescapably has been the attitude that some people have had towards Brexit. “So there are some ministers who have been hard-driving, who have worried that across the civil service  there was a sense that Brexit was a big, historic mistake. “Therefore there hasn’t been the same enthusiasm for some of the changes that are necessary as there might have been for other policy changes.” In the podcast the leading Brexiteer also reflected on his brutal sacking by Boris Johnson.  During his final days as PM, Borisdealt one final blow  to his ally-turned-nemesis by sacking him days before being toppled from the top job.  Mr Gove said: “I was at home with one particular very old friend, Boris rang, he said, ‘look, I’m rearranging the government,’ and all the rest of it, ‘and I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to step back,’ and so on. “And I said, ‘so you’re not going?’ And he said, ‘no, no, I’m afraid you are’.” Load-Date: June 3, 2023  End of Document
