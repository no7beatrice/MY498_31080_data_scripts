The demonstration, organized by the National Rejoin March, was the largest pro-European rally since October last year and was attended by civil society activists and members of the European Parliament, such as former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt. The aim of the march has been to make visible an increasingly clear trend in the polls: the support for a new referendum for a possible return of the United Kingdom to the community club.          One of the latest polls on Brexit, published by YouGov in early August, shows that 46% of Britons are in favor of holding a new vote in 10 years' time, compared to 36% who are against. In the event of such a referendum, 49% of respondents say they would vote in favor of returning to the EU, while 33% would opt to remain outside. This data demonstrates the change of opinion that many Britons have had in recent years, as a result of the turbulent negotiations and the unfulfilled promises of successive Conservative governments.   Slow process          "I think a lot of people are disappointed by false and unpleasant political rhetoric. The truth is starting to come out, although unfortunately this situation has already done a lot of damage," explains Amanda Simmons, a retired teacher who attended the demonstration. Simmons admits however that a future reinstatement to the club will not happen instantly and that there is still some way to go. "Change will take time but I think we can move closer, get better agreements, work in a friendlier way with our neighbors. It will be incremental rather than immediate," he says.          Simon, another attendee, believes that demonstrations of force in the street are a first step in getting public opinion convinced. "It won't happen overnight, a lot of changes have to happen first, but we have to become a European country again. Unfortunately many people still defend the UK's imperialist past and believe it should stay that way," he explains. "The EU is an organization that promotes better living standards: of course we will align ourselves with it. It is incomprehensible to me that anyone would not want to be part of this movement," he adds.  Labor rapprochement          The debate about a possible rapprochement between London and Brussels has been growing in recent days at the hands of Labour Party leader Keir Starmer. His visit to Europol headquarters, in which he opened the door to a new migration agreement with the EU, and his meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, have put on record Labour's interest in renegotiating some of the Brexit agreements should it win the next general election. Starmer, however, continues to move cautiously on an issue that remains thorny and may affect the good results projected by the polls for his party.          "I have repeated on multiple occasions that there is no room for a return to the EU, and that includes the single market and the customs union," the Labour leader said this week following the publication of statements in which he said he "did not want to diverge" with Brussels. "Laws will continue to be passed in Parliament in the national interest, but that does not mean that a Labour government wants to lower standards in terms of food safety or labor rights," he said.          The Labour leader is aware that any false step on this issue will be used by the Conservative Party to try to gain electoral advantage. Something of which the detractors of Brexit are also aware. "We don't know if Starmer will change his mind in case he wins the election, but for now he doesn't want to venture," explains Peter Yearsly, an attendee at the demonstration, surrounded by European flags and posters with messages such as "give us back our star" or "freedom of movement". For Yearsly, the only way to return to the EU is with a majority support of the population, but he recognizes that many Brexit voters still reject that it was a mistake. "Unfortunately it' s not yet possible. We will see further down the line."  Load-Date: September 24, 2023  End of Document
