   Braverman sacked and a shock return to Cabinet-how Sunak's reshuffle unfolded telegraph.co.uk November 13, 2023 Monday 7:06 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:3 Length: 10552 words Byline: By Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor and Dominic Penna, Political Correspondent Body   A former minister published her letter of no-confidence in Rishi Sunak on Monday evening, amid a backlash to his reshuffle from the Right of the Conservative Party. Dame Andrea Jenkyns, who served in the Department for Education under Boris Johnson, shared her letter on Twitter after Mr Sunak carried out sweeping changes to his top team aimed at shoring up the moderate wing of the party. These included the shock return of David Cameron, the former prime minister, who has been elevated to the House of Lords to serve as the new Foreign Secretary. In her letter, Dame Andrea wrote: “Enough is enough. If it wasn’t bad enough that we have a party leader that the party members rejected, the polls demonstrate that the public reject him, and I am in full agreement. It is time for Rishi Sunak to go.” She accused Mr Sunak of deciding to “purge the centre-Right from his Cabinet” and criticised his decision to sack Suella Braverman from her post as home secretary, saying Mrs Braverman was “the only person in the cabinet with the balls to speak the truth of the appalling state of our streets and a two-tier policing system” in the wake of a row over her comments about pro-Palestinian protests. Dame Andrea added: “I [submit this letter] to stand up and fight for true conservatism. We must be a party that delivers low taxes, be trusted on the economy and turbo charge our skills to power our economy. We must be strong on law and order, take control of our borders, be energy independent as a nation and stand up for freedom of speech.” A confidence vote in Mr Sunak’s leadership of the Conservative Party would be triggered if 15 per cent of his MPs submitted letters indicating that they wanted a change of leader.                      13 Nov 2023-07:05PM GMT                                         That's all for today...                    Not many days bring with them a political appointment or dismissal that sends shockwaves through Westminster. But Monday saw both before midday as Rishi Sunak not only sacked Suella Braverman from her post as home secretary after days of speculation about her future but brought former prime minister David Cameron into the fold, elevating him to the House of Lords so that he can serve as the Foreign Secretary. Mr Sunak proceeded to conduct a wide-ranging reshuffle in which James Cleverly, the previous holder of Lord Cameron’s new post, succeed Mrs Braverman at the Home Office, along with a range of promotions for members of the 2019 intake of MPs. In what was widely viewed as a demotion, Steve Barclay was moved to Environment Secretary, with Victoria Atkins, a former Treasury minister, taking his place at the Department for Health. The character of Mr Sunak’s top team change today, with Lord Cameron’s appointment and Mrs Braverman’s sacking in particular seen as an attempt to pull the Conservative Party towards the centre ground with around a year to go until the next general election. As the most dramatic day of Westminster politics in 2023 ended with the publication of a single letter of no confidence in the Prime Minister, Mr Sunak does not need to worry about his political survival. But with the Tories continuing to trail Labour by 20 points in the opinion polls, and key pledges on immigration and the economy still to meet, he must hope his reshuffled Cabinet can do enough to secure his party what would be a historic fifth term in a row.                      My colleague Jack Maidment will be back early tomorrow to guide you through the latest.                                         13 Nov 2023-06:56PM GMT                                         Pictured: Rishi Sunak at Guildhall for foreign policy speech                                         13 Nov 2023-06:54PM GMT                                         David Cameron: Greensill scandal is 'in the past'                                         13 Nov 2023-06:40PM GMT                                         Nadine Dorries: 'Utterly bizarre' for Sunak to appoint Cameron                    Nadine Dorries has branded Rishi Sunak’s decision to ennoble David Cameron and appoint him as Foreign Secretary as “utterly bizarre”. Ms Dorries, a former Tory cabinet minister, said: ”[David Cameron] has gone to the House of Lords – it’s so easy for someone who went to Eton to be just popped into the House of Lords overnight but if you went to a council school… it’s not so easy. “That sounds like sour grapes from me and it isn’t really, he’s an ex-prime minister who had a long career leading the party.” She added: “David Cameron went to the EU to get some concessions to try and prevent a referendum, he failed, the referendum happened and it was incredibly divisive. Remain lost, and then he took his bat and ball home and resigned which he should never have done.”                      13 Nov 2023-06:31PM GMT                                         Paul Scully sacked as minister for London                    Paul Scully has been sacked as the minister for London and small businesses, The Telegraph can confirm.                      13 Nov 2023-06:27PM GMT                                         Tim Loughton calls fellow Tory MP 'pantomime dame'                    Tim Loughton, a former minister on the ‘One Nation’ wing of the Tory party, has called Dame Andrea Jenkyns a “pantomime dame” after she submitted a no-confidence letter in Rishi Sunak in the past hour: Where can we submit a letter of no confidence in the Pantomime Dame? https://t.co/teqqAWWBdJ                      13 Nov 2023-06:15PM GMT                                         Rishi Sunak: Today we have built a united team                    The Prime Minister wrote on X: “Today we have built a united team ready to deliver the changes this country needs for the long term.

Mr Khan, the Labour Mayor of London, told Times Radio: “It’s just great to see that the prime minister has finally grown a backbone. “I think some of the words, action and behaviour from Suella Braverman over the course of the last couple of weeks has been astonishing. I’ve never known a Home Secretary to undermine the police in the way she has sought to do so.” Last weekend, Mr Khan accused Mrs Braverman of stirring up the far-Right and said violent clashes involving counter-protesters on Armistice Day were a “direct result” of her words after she had accused the Metropolitan Police of bias towards “pro-Palestinian mobs”.                      13 Nov 2023-05:43PM GMT                                         Esther McVey currently in Downing Street                    Esther McVey, a Tory MP on the Right of the party, is currently in Downing Street.

And of course this government my role in it all of that will be accountable to the electorate at the general election when it comes. But in the meantime I want to do everything to strengthen our alliances, to work with our friends, to build those vital partnerships, to make sure our country is secure and prosperous in a difficult and dangerous world. “That work starts now and I’ve got to get on with it.”                      13 Nov 2023-05:11PM GMT                                         Lord Cameron: Greensill row 'all dealt with and in the past'                    Asked about past criticism by the Treasury select committee of his “significant lack of judgment” in lobbying Rishi Sunak  over financial firm Greensill Capital, Lord Cameron replied: “Well the most important thing I’ve done since leaving office is to act as president of Alzheimer’s research and to raise millions of pounds and help our scientists to get closer to a diagnosis and a cure for something that affects almost one million people in this country. “But today I resigned from all of those things, from all of the businesses I’ve been helping and all of the other things I’ve been doing, including being a professor at NYU, that all stops. I now have one job as Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom and I’m very proud to work with our Prime Minister to make sure our country can be as secure and as prosperous as possible.” Pressed on the criticisms, Lord Cameron said: “I think all those things were dealt with by the Treasury select committee, by other inquiries at the time, and as far as I’m concerned that is all dealt with and in the past, and I now have one job, as Britain’s Foreign Secretary as part of Rishi Sunak’s team to try and make sure this country can be secure and prosperous in a difficult and dangerous world.”                      13 Nov 2023-05:09PM GMT                                         David Cameron: I'm a member of the team                    Lord Cameron insisted he will adhere to collective Cabinet responsibility in his new post as Foreign Secretary. Since his initial departure from frontline politics, he has criticised successive Conservative governments over various policy decisions including Boris Johnson’s abandonment of a commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on foreign aid and Rishi Sunak scaling back the HS2 rail project last month. But the peer told Sky News: “On the whole, as an ex-prime minister I’ve tried to keep quiet about politics, stay out of politics. It’s hard enough being prime minister without having your predecessors endlessly giving a running commentary. But look of course I’ve disagreed with some individual decisions but politics is a team enterprise. “I’ve decided to join this team as I believe Rishi Sunak is a good Prime Minister, doing a difficult job at a hard time, I want to support him. I’m a member of the team and I accept the Cabinet collective responsibility that comes with that.”                      13 Nov 2023-05:05PM GMT                                         Breaking: Lord Cameron speaks for first time as Foreign Secretary                    Speaking to Sky News, Lord Cameron, the new Foreign Secretary, said: “Well I know it’s not usual for a prime minister to come back in this way but I believe in public service. The Prime Minister asked me to do this job and it’s a time where we have some daunting challenges as a country, the conflict in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine. “And of course I hope that six years as prime minister, 11 years leading the Conservative Party, gives me some useful experience and contacts and relationships and knowledge that I can help the Prime Minister to make sure we build our alliances, we build partnerships with our friends, we deter our enemies, and we keep our country strong. That’s why I’m doing the job and I’m delighted to accept.”                      13 Nov 2023-04:53PM GMT                                         'Of course' David Cameron believes in making Brexit work, says No10                    Asked whether David Cameron believes in Brexit, the Prime Minister’s press secretary told a lobby reporters’ briefing: “Yes, of course.

Mr Sunak’s press secretary said: “Conservatives don’t do tick-box diversity. We’ve had three female leaders… We do not feel the need to do that kind of tick box diversity.”                      13 Nov 2023-04:52PM GMT                                         No10: Suella Braverman had to go as ministers must 'speak with one voice'                    Government ministers must “speak with one voice”, Downing Street has said as it defended Rishi Sunak’s decision to sack Suella Braverman. The Prime Minister’s press secretary told reporters: “I would say there were differences of style and it’s right that we can move forward now and focus on what matters to people.” She added: “Our Prime Minister believes that collective responsibility is an important principle and therefore senior ministers speak with one voice. So you can take from that what you want. ”Clearly there were some issues around language. The Prime Minister reserves the right to change the team sheet around the time at which he sees fit.”                      13 Nov 2023-04:44PM GMT                                         Janet Daley: It would be a mistake for the Tory Right to go with Suella Braverman                    Of course it was inevitable, writes Janet Daley. Suella Braverman was so clearly defiant of Cabinet collective responsibility that she made it impossible for the Prime Minister, struggling to maintain his credibility, to keep her in office. But leaving the more squalid power struggle aside for a moment, let’s look at the substantive matter.This is the heart of it: what the former home secretary was saying about the most dangerously contentious issue of the day was inherently – presumably deliberately – inflammatory. It may not have been factually incorrect to say that the police were taking too soft an approach to militant Palestinian activism. It was not necessarily wrong to suggest that the British people were being let down by the Government’s apparent failure to get to grips with a volatile minority in its midst.What was unacceptable was that she framed these opinions in inflammatory terms which undermined the moral argument that might have been made against the “hate” she wanted to condemn. At a time when irrationality and loathing were becoming serious threats to civil order, she was raising the temperature rather than lowering it. What she advocated sounded more like recrimination and revenge than an attempt to bring reconciliation.

Sir Lindsay told MPs: “This is not the first time in recent years that a Cabinet minister has been appointed in the House of Lords, but given the gravity of the current international situation, it is especially important that this House is able to scrutinise the work of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office effectively. “I have therefore commissioned advice from the clerks about possible options for enhancing (scrutiny) of the work of the Foreign Secretary when that post is filled by a member of the other House. “I also look forward to hearing the Government’s proposals on how the Foreign Secretary will be properly accountable to this House.”                      13 Nov 2023-02:42PM GMT                                         Science minister George Freeman resigns                     Science minister George Freeman said he was resigning from the Government. In a letter to the Prime Minister he said he would be standing down “with a heavy heart” and that he had made his decision in the summer.  After 13yrs working to champion Science, Research, Technology & Innovation as Minister of the Crown in 5 roles under 4 Prime Ministers, I decided in the summer it was time to move on at the next reshuffle.

James Cleverly was wanted by Tory election strategists to have a domestic-facing role for the election campaign. So he moves from the Foreign Office to the Home Office.  Richard Holden, the 2019-intake Tory MP who led the charge against Sir Keir Starmer over what the Tories dubbed “Beergate” to some effect, is the new Conservative Party chairman.  Meanwhile, Thérèse Coffey, a close Liz Truss ally whose skills on the media round were questioned by some in Downing Street, is gone as environment secretary.  And David Cameron, who managed to win two general elections as Conservative Party leader, if you count the 2010 vote which led to a coalition but with him as prime minister, is back. This all suggests a reshuffle with eyes fixed firmly on the next general election.                       13 Nov 2023-02:24PM GMT                                         Victoria Atkins appointed Health Secretary                    Victoria Atkins has been appointed Health Secretary, replacing Steve Barclay who has moved to be Environment Secretary.

A party source said: “This retro reshuffle shows the Conservatives are openly running scared of the Lib Dems in the Blue Wall.  “Bringing back David Cameron just looks desperate. If the Tories think this will save them seats in their southern flank, they have got another thing coming. “Blue Wall voters abandoned this chaotic government some time ago and aren’t coming back in a hurry.”                      13 Nov 2023-01:35PM GMT                                         Sir Simon Clarke appears to criticise reshuffle                    Tory MP and Liz Truss ally Sir Simon Clarke appeared to take aim at Rishi Sunak’s Cabinet reshuffle this lunchtime. In a post on Twitter, the former business secretary shared a post about Gareth Southgate’s decision not to include Raheem Sterling in his England squad. He warned it is “never wise to lack options on the right wing”:  Some controversial choices here from the manager, putting it very mildly.

Kemi Badenoch wrote on Twitter: “Very sorry to see you leave government, Rachel. You were an excellent minister, always attentive to MPs and their constituents and got some very tricky legislation over the line!” Ms Maclean’s departure means that her successor will be the 16th housing minister since the Conservatives took office in 2010, and the eighth since the 2019 general election.                      13 Nov 2023-01:08PM GMT                                         PM 'doing the right thing' with Cabinet reshuffle, says Kwarteng                     Rishi Sunak is doing the “right thing” by restructuring his top team in the wake of the row surrounding Suella Braverman, Kwasi Kwarteng has said. Mr Kwarteng, a former chancellor, told Times Radio his party is still facing a “really difficult election” but added: “That will be so much worse if you have Cabinet ministers essentially going off piste, doing their own thing, jockeying for position after the election. “And what he needs actually is a team that’s loyal and that’s able to deliver on his priorities. And I think having ministers essentially going solo, it doesn’t lead to that. So I think that he’s doing the right thing and I think this probably should be his last reshuffle.” Describing Mrs Braverman’s sacking as an “inevitability”, Mr Kwarteng added: “She was acting with increasing independence for months actually before today. And I think that she made the Prime Minister’s position very difficult.”                      13 Nov 2023-01:02PM GMT                                         Sunak thanks Coffey for 'years of dedicated ministerial service'                     Rishi Sunak has thanked outgoing environment secretary Therese Coffey for “years of dedicated ministerial service and your friendship to me personally”. He said her “teamwork and positivity” had “helped bring everyone together” during a “difficult time for our party” when she took on roles as both health secretary and deputy prime minister. “I want to express my gratitude to you for your years of dedicated ministerial service and your friendship to me personally,” he said in a letter to Ms Coffey.                      13 Nov 2023-12:57PM GMT                                         Richard Holden arrives at 10 Downing Street                    Richard Holden, the roads minister, has just arrived at 10 Downing Street.                       13 Nov 2023-12:52PM GMT                                         Housing minister Rachel Maclean 'asked to step down'                    I’ve been asked to step down from my role as Housing Minister.

The now former environment secretary said in a resignation letter to Rishi Sunak: “Having been a minister since July 2014, and having served all five Conservative prime ministers, I consider it is now the right time to step back from government.” She added: “I look forward to supporting you from the backbenches and working together for a Conservative majority at the next election, which I believe to be profoundly in the national interest.”                      13 Nov 2023-12:41PM GMT                                         Steve Barclay arrives at 10 Downing Street                     Steve Barclay, the Health Secretary, has just been spotted going into 10 Downing Street.  There has been some speculation in recent days that Mr Barclay could be moved to a different Cabinet brief.                       13 Nov 2023-12:30PM GMT                                         EU Brexit chief thanks Cleverly and welcomes Lord Cameron                    Maros Sefcovic, the executive vice president of the European Commission, has thanked James Cleverly for the “good and constructive work” they had done on Brexit.  He also welcomed Lord Cameron as Mr Cleverly’s replacement as Foreign Secretary.  I congratulate @JamesCleverly  on his appointment as Home Secretary.

Here is the data which could provide some clues as to why he has been brought back to the political front line by Rishi Sunak:                       13 Nov 2023-12:13PM GMT                                         Tory MP fears Sunak 'wants to turn clock back to Cameron liberalism'                    A senior Tory MP who represents a Red Wall constituency said they feared Rishi Sunak wanted to “turn the clock back to Cameron liberalism”.  Responding to the appointment of Lord Cameron as Foreign Secretary, they said: “I just despair. The optics are all wrong. It is almost as though he is ignoring the Brexit referendum and 2019 election. He wants to turn the clock back to Cameron liberalism. “It is very alarming. Most of the key offices of state are now held by people who don’t really understand what is happening in British politics. I am predicting a softening on small boats, a softening on legal migration. I would not be surprised if the ban on conversion therapy returns.”                      13 Nov 2023-12:03PM GMT                                         SNP: Cameron appointment shows UK 'not a serious country'                    Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s leader in Westminster, said the UK is “not a serious country” after Rishi Sunak decided to appoint Lord Cameron to the role of Foreign Secretary.  Mr Flynn pointed out that because Lord Cameron is a peer and will be speaking for the Government in the House of Lords, MPs will no longer be able to ask questions of the foreign secretary in the House of Commons.  He tweeted:  Truly remarkable that during a time of huge international unrest, not least in Ukraine and Gaza, the House of Commons will not be able to directly scrutinise the work of the actual Foreign Secretary. The UK is not a serious country.                      13 Nov 2023-11:59AM GMT                                         More Cabinet changes likely after Sunak visits office in Parliament                     Rishi Sunak was in his Parliament office for part of this morning and he is now back in No10, The Telegraph understands.  This is significant because normally when a prime minister sacks people from his top team he will do so in Parliament-in part to spare departing people a difficult walk in front of the media in Downing Street.  The Prime Minister’s movements would therefore suggest that there could be more Cabinet changes in the coming hours.                       13 Nov 2023-11:50AM GMT                                         Lord Heseltine: Tory 'right wing lurch' has been 'put to bed'                    Lord Heseltine, the former Tory deputy prime minister, said the appointment of Lord Cameron as Foreign Secretary was a “signal” that the Conservative Party’s “lurch” to the right had been “put to bed”.  Asked to sum up the return of Lord Cameron in one word, Lord Heseltine told Times Radio: “Excellent. If you limit me to a word, but that’s not a bad start. But of course, I am delighted at the news. I am a great admirer of David Cameron and worked for him for many years.  “I think this will send an important signal to the country, but also to the world. So it’s excellent news.” Lord Heseltine said it was the “clearest signal that the sort of right wing lurch that we’ve seen and the anti-European movement that we’ve seen has been put to bed, and that will get a message across to people”.                      13 Nov 2023-11:41AM GMT                                         Mark Harper hails Lord Cameron as 'real team player'                     Transport Secretary Mark Harper said the decision to appoint Lord Cameron as Foreign Secretary was “an excellent move”. He told the media during a visit to a pothole-repair project in Surrey this morning: “I was in David Cameron’s government as his chief whip. He’s a team player, hugely experienced. “Given the challenges facing us with the war in Ukraine (and) what’s going on in the Middle East, having a really experienced person coming in as Foreign Secretary, I think, is an excellent move. “He’s a real team player and I look forward to seeing him around the Cabinet table.”                      13 Nov 2023-11:34AM GMT                                         Braverman ally hits back at criticism of ex-home secretary                    An ally of Suella Braverman has responded to the criticisms aimed at her by government insiders in the post below at 10.55.  On the claim of failing to deliver, the ally said: “That’s funny because the Prime Minister said our plan is working and boat numbers are down by 30 per cent, while we’re getting migrants out of hotels. They sound a bit all over the place, which isn’t new.”                      13 Nov 2023-11:28AM GMT                                         Why can David Cameron attend Cabinet if he is not an MP?                     While the overwhelming majority of Cabinet ministers are MPs, you do not have to be an MP to be in the Cabinet. There is no such rule and peers can be given Cabinet roles too.  Nor do you have to be an MP to be appointed to one of the great offices of state-although it is certainly very unusual in modern times for a peer to be given one of those four major positions. Currently there is only one peer who is in the Cabinet and that is Lord True who is the Leader of the House of Lords. Lord Cameron will take that number to two.                       13 Nov 2023-11:23AM GMT                                         Appointment of Cameron shows Tories are 'tired', says SNP                    The SNP’s Westminster deputy leader Mhairi Black said the appointment of Lord Cameron showed the Government was “tired”.  She said: “The fact that Rishi Sunak has had to resurrect David Cameron shows how tired this Tory government is. “People in Scotland will be appalled that the architect of thirteen years of Tory austerity cuts, and the disastrous Brexit referendum, is back in government.”                      13 Nov 2023-11:12AM GMT                                         Sir Iain Duncan Smith ‘astonished’ by return of Lord Cameron                    Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, said he was “astonished” at the appointment of David Cameron, now Lord Cameron, because of his links to China, writes Charles Hymas.  “I am astonished at this appointment. It seems to send a signal to China that we are pursuing business with them at all costs and any costs,” said Sir Iain who has been sanctioned by the Chinese regime. “Those who have been sanctioned now feel more abandoned than at any time. Those facing genocide and persecution will feel more abandoned than at any time.” Mr Cameron previously served as the vice-chair of a £1bn China-UK investment fund. His coalition government also hailed a “golden era” of relations with Beijing.                      13 Nov 2023-11:10AM GMT                                         Cleverly 'absolutely committed to stopping the boats'                    James Cleverly said it had been a “huge privilege” to serve as Foreign Secretary as he spoke to broadcasters outside the Home Office.  The new Home Secretary said he was “absolutely committed to stopping the boats as we promised but also making sure that everybody in the UK feels safe and secure going about their daily business, knowing that the Government is here to protect them”.  He said he believed being Home Secretary is a “fantastic job”.                       13 Nov 2023-11:04AM GMT                                         Decarbonisation minister Jesse Norman resigns                    Very grateful to the Prime Minister for accepting my resignation.

And it is wider than just what happened in recent days, writes Ben Riley-Smith.  One is that she has been undermining Government unity. “To be blunt, she is just not a team player,” said a government source about why she was moved on. The second is that-again, more bluntness-the Home Secretary was not delivering in the role in Number 10’s eyes. “Substance and policy has to follow rhetoric,” the source added.  It is being argued that Mrs Braverman’s removal was not specifically over her Times article accusing the police of bias or what happened this weekend, with dissatisfaction in Downing Street preceding that.  The Prime Minister is said to have been weighing changes to his Cabinet team for some time. Plus, there is a political gamble-that Mrs Braverman has overstated her support in the party.  Figures arguing that last point are pointing to the backlash to the then home secretary’s comments about rough sleeping in tents being a “lifestyle choice”, which was criticised by some Tory MPs.                      13 Nov 2023-10:52AM GMT                                         Health minister Will Quince stands down                     Will Quince, a health minister, has announced he is stepping down from his Government role.  Mr Quince, who is not standing at the next general election, said in a letter to Rishi Sunak that “now feels like the right time to leave HM Government”.  I have asked the Prime Minister that I be allowed to step down from my role as Minister of State at @DHSCgovuk  and he has kindly agreed.

Sir Jacob, a former business secretary, insisted Mrs Braverman – who was dismissed by Mr Sunak this morning – “has been saying what people are thinking” on immigration.  “I think firing her is a mistake, and that she understood what the country wanted and needed in terms of migration, and I think it raises questions about the seriousness of the Government in tackling illegal migration,” he told The Telegraph. Asked for his thoughts on David Cameron’s return to politics, Sir Jacob replied: “Governments don’t stand or fall on the appointment of a Foreign Secretary.”                      13 Nov 2023-10:44AM GMT                                         Cameron's disagreements with Sunak                     David Cameron accused Rishi Sunak last month of throwing away a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” by scrapping High Speed Two (HS2).  The former prime minister took to Twitter to post a long, critical message after Mr Sunak confirmed the move at Conservative Party conference on October 4.  He wrote: “I regret this decision and in years to come I suspect many will look back at today’s announcement and wonder how this once-in-a-generation opportunity was lost.” Mr Cameron was also highly critical of the Government’s decision in November 2020 to break the commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of gross national income on international aid. Here is his tweet:  I deeply regret today’s decision to break our promise to spend 0.7% of GNI on development.

The last occasion was at the end of Gordon Brown’s Labour government, when these roles were held by Mr Brown, Alistair Darling, Alan Johnson and David Miliband respectively.                      13 Nov 2023-10:30AM GMT                                         Pictured: James Cleverly arrives at Home Office                                          13 Nov 2023-10:27AM GMT                                         Cameron concedes he has disagreed with Sunak in the past                     David Cameron said he hoped his experience as Tory leader and PM would help Rishi Sunak to meet “vital challenges” on the world stage.  In a lengthy statement posted on Twitter following his appointment as Foreign Secretary, Mr Cameron also said that while in the past he had disagreed with some of Mr Sunak’s decisions he believed the latter is a “strong and capable” premier.  He said: “I want to help him to deliver the security and prosperity our country needs and be part of the strongest possible team that serves the United Kingdom and that can be presented to the country when the General Election is held.” The Prime Minister has asked me to serve as his Foreign Secretary and I have gladly accepted.We are facing a daunting set of international challenges, including the war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East. At this time of profound global change, it has rarely been more…                      13 Nov 2023-10:22AM GMT                                         Analysis: Sacking was not a surprise for Braverman                     Suella Braverman was not surprised to receive the call from Rishi Sunak on Monday morning ending her 12-month tenure as Home Secretary, writes Charles Hymas, The Telegraph’s home affairs editor.  Sources said she “pretty much knew” on Sunday night that she was about to lose her job after a series of controversies over her outspoken criticism of police bias in tackling the pro Palestinian protests and street vagrancy. She was said to be calm over the decision ending her second stint as Home Secretary when she was reappointed to the post by Mr Sunak on October 25 having previously quit the post under Liz Truss’s brief premiership. This summer, in an interview with The Telegraph, she insisted she had no qualms about speaking frankly, even if this may have cost her her job.  Polarised views, she said, came with the territory the Home Office covers of migration, law and order and security. “We live in an open democracy, we need to exchange views and I’m up for the debate and I’m not shy about prosecuting my viewpoint energetically,” she said.                      13 Nov 2023-10:19AM GMT                                         Return of Cameron a 'life raft' for Sunak, claim Labour                    Labour claimed the return of David Cameron to government amounted to Rishi Sunak attempting to deploy a “life raft” to keep his premiership afloat.  The party’s national campaign coordinator Pat McFadden said: “A few weeks ago Rishi Sunak said David Cameron was part of a failed status quo, now he’s bringing him back as his life raft. “This puts to bed the Prime Minister’s laughable claim to offer change from 13 years of Tory failure.”                      13 Nov 2023-10:17AM GMT                                         Therese Coffey enters No10                     Therese Coffey has entered 10 Downing Street amid the ongoing ministerial reshuffle.                      13 Nov 2023-10:14AM GMT                                         Analysis: Cameron return proves Sunak's inner circle can keep a secret                    David Cameron’s return confirms one thing-that Rishi Sunak’s inner circle can keep a secret, writes Ben Riley-Smith, The Telegraph’s political editor.  For such a major political move it is eye-catching that the news did not leak in any form.  At the core of the Prime Minister’s team is a group of advisers who have largely carried over from his time in the Treasury when he was made chancellor back in February 2020.  There is delight in parts of Downing Street this morning that their ‘rabbit out of a hat’ moment had not been preceded by speculation, as often happens with big government announcements.                       13 Nov 2023-10:13AM GMT                                         Jeremy Hunt to stay on as Chancellor                     Jeremy Hunt will remain as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Downing Street has said.                       13 Nov 2023-10:03AM GMT                                         David Cameron appointed Foreign Secretary                    David Cameron has been appointed Foreign Secretary, Downing Street has announced. Mr Cameron has been made a life peer to enable him to take up the Cabinet role.                      13 Nov 2023-10:00AM GMT                                         Historical significance of Cameron's expected return to Cabinet                     The historical significance of David Cameron’s expected return to the Cabinet should not be underestimated.  It will be only the second time since the Second World War that a former prime minister has returned to Cabinet.  The rarity of the move was pointed out on Twitter by Politico’s Dan Bloom:  As far as I can tell.. David Cameron will be only the second time since WW2 that an ex-PM has returned to Cabinet. The other was the 1970s, when Alec Douglas-Home become foreign secretary.(I think before that it was Chamberlain serving in Churchill's war cabinet)                      13 Nov 2023-09:55AM GMT                                         New Home Secretary leaves Downing Street                    James Cleverly has now left Downing Street after being appointed the new Home Secretary. Reporters shouted questions at Mr Cleverly to ask if he was happy with the move from the Foreign Office but he did not appear to respond as he walked away.                       13 Nov 2023-09:43AM GMT                                         James Cleverly appointed Home Secretary                    James Cleverly has been appointed Home Secretary following the sacking of Suella Braverman.

Sir Ed said in a statement: “Suella Braverman was never fit to be Home Secretary. Rishi Sunak knew this and he still appointed her. “It was the Prime Minister’s sheer cowardice that kept her in the job even for this long. We are witnessing a broken party and a broken government, both of which are breaking this country. “This whole sorry saga has shown the Conservative party for what they truly are. An unruly mob more focussed on fighting and undermining each other rather than standing up for their constituents and fixing the country that they have broken. “They need to put us all out of our misery and call a general election now.”                      13 Nov 2023-09:36AM GMT                                         Tory MP criticises Sunak over sacking of Braverman                    Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns has criticised Rishi Sunak for sacking Suella Braverman, labelling it a “bad call”.

It is unclear whether it is in the Cabinet, which would involve the former prime minister presumably becoming a peer, or a looser position that does not need him to become a Lord.                       13 Nov 2023-09:09AM GMT                                         Schools minister Nick Gibb quits                     Schools minister Nick Gibb said he had quit the Government and would not stand at the next general election. “Over the last few weeks I have been discussing taking up a diplomatic role after the general election,” he said. “To enable me to do so I have asked the Prime Minister if I can step down from the Government at the reshuffle and he has agreed.” He added: “I campaigned for Rishi last summer and I remain an enthusiastic supporter of the Prime Minister’s leadership.”                      13 Nov 2023-08:57AM GMT                                         David Cameron arrives at 10 Downing Street                    A stunning development in Westminster this morning as David Cameron arrives in Downing Street amid Rishi Sunak’s Cabinet reshuffle. The former prime minister entered No10 just before 9am.  There is speculation that Mr Cameron could be handed a seat in the House of Lords to allow him to become a Cabinet minister.  Mr Cameron has been away from the political frontline for more than seven years after his exit from No10 in July 2016 in the wake of the Brexit referendum                      13 Nov 2023-08:48AM GMT                                         James Cleverly spotted going into No10                     James Cleverly, the Foreign Secretary, has just been spotted going into Downing Street.

The armed forces minister was asked during an interview on Sky News this morning if he thought Mrs Braverman should be sacked.  He replied: “That is a matter for the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister alone. There is plenty for all of us to be getting on with in our departments rather than worrying about speculation of a reshuffle.”                       13 Nov 2023-08:24AM GMT                                         ‘Incorrect’ to blame Braverman for counter-protest disorder, says minister                    James Heappey, the armed forces minister, said it would be “incorrect” to blame Suella Braverman for counter-protests to the pro-Palestinian march which took place on Armistice Day.  Asked how much of the disorder at the weekend could be laid at the Home Secretary’s door, Mr Heappey told Times Radio: “I wouldn’t have used some of the words that the Home Secretary used in her article but I also think that it would be incorrect to say that those protests, the counter protests, were entirely a consequence of what she wrote.  “Tommy Robinson and his EDL thugs were planning their counter protest well before the Home Secretary published that article.”                      13 Nov 2023-08:14AM GMT                                         Minister unable to say if Braverman will be Home Secretary in a week’s time                    A minister was unable to say if Suella Braverman will still be Home Secretary in a week’s time amid uncertainty over her future.  Speculation is rife at Westminster that Rishi Sunak could carry out a ministerial reshuffle as soon as today which could see her moved. James Heappey, the armed forces minister, was asked this morning during an interview on Times Radio whether he could say if Mrs Braverman will still be in her job in a week’s time.  He replied: “I don’t think that I can. I think that is an issue for the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister alone, I’m afraid.” Load-Date: November 14, 2023  End of Document
