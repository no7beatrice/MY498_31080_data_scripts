   Labour's possible victory in 2024 reopens Brexit debate CE Noticias Financieras English September 24, 2023 Sunday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

It took time to assimilate the historic divorce and even longer to negotiate a break-up that was not abrupt, in order to avoid economic collapse. But it seems that the British are unable to turn the page. Can the United Kingdom become the new "associate member" of the bloc by 2030?   In the midst of the pre-campaign for next year's elections and with all the polls predicting a new Labour government led by Keir Starmer (who once voted to remain in the EU), Brexit is once again on the front pages in the face of the promise of the now leader of the opposition, once negotiated by Boris Johnson. The pact was sealed between London and Brussels on December 24, 2020. But it was not the final chapter of the tortuous divorce. Nothing could be further from the truth. Article 776 provides for a review every five years, so it provides an opportunity for both sides to sit down at the table again. And the timing coincides with a key moment, as the Franco-German axis has put forward a proposal for EU enlargement with four levels of integration. Not that in Brussels there is an obsession with wanting to win back the United Kingdom, the world's sixth largest economy, at all costs. The priorities now for the EU club are different, especially as it faces one of its most serious challenges in recent years with the massive influx of migrants to the Italian island of Lampedusa that has exposed the deep divisions between member states. But the invasion of Ukraine has marked a before and after. The enlargement of the bloc really has Ukraine and the Western Balkans in mind to prevent them, one way or another, from ending up under Russian control. In any case, European diplomatic sources assured The Times that the idea of a four-speed EU has also been designed with Starmer in Downing Street in mind. The proposal is carefully balanced politically to be a potential possibility for London without the need for rejoining or a referendum. The possible enlargement is set out in the report prepared by a group of twelve experts convened by the French and German governments to further assess increasing the EU's capacity for action and strengthening the rule of law and democratic legitimacy. The text has had more impact in the British media than in the rest of Europe, especially after Starmer has said he does not want the UK to opt out of EU rules. "Obviously, the more values we share, the more future together we will have. There will be less conflict and, in fact, we will have more different ways of solving problems," he said on his international tour. Facing criticism from Euroskeptics, who accuse him of wanting to "betray Brexit," Starmer insists there is no reason to rejoin the EU. Leading members of his team, such as Jonathan Reynolds, have ruled out the possibility of "associate membership." But what they say in public is one thing; what they say in private is another. A clear majority of Labour members favor exactly the kind of "associate membership" offered by the Franco-German plan. They know they cannot say so openly because there is no desire to reopen the Brexit pandora's box and risk a repeat of their 2019 election defeat. But privately they believe that the status quo is unsustainable in the long term and that, at the very least, the UK needs a closer Norway-style relationship with what is its largest trading partner. The U.K. already belongs to the existing European Political Community, the 40-plus nation conversation forum created by France. What's more, the next summit in the spring of 2024 will be hosted by London. Load-Date: September 25, 2023  End of Document
