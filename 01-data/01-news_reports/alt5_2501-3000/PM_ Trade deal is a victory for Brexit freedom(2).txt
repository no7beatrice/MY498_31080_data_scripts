   PM: Trade deal is a victory for Brexit freedom Scottish Express July 17, 2023 Monday Edition 1, Scotland  Copyright 2023 Express Newspapers All Rights Reserved Section: NEWS; Pg. 14 Length: 283 words Byline: Michael Knowles Body   POST-Brexit freedoms paved the way to a blockbuster trade deal, the Prime Minister claimed yesterday. International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch signed an agreement with 11 countries in the Indo-Pacific trade bloc, giving businesses access to a market worth £12trillion. But she admitted the chances of a similar pact with the US were "very low" as President Biden has different priorities. Ms Badenoch said the American administration has told multiple countries that Washington does not want to do free-trade deals and "we need to respect that". It is hoped that joining the Indo-Pacific group - the biggest trade agreement since Brexit - will boost UK exports by cutting tariffs on goods such as dairy and British beef and lamb, cars, gin and whisky. Other members include major economies such as Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, Japan and Singapore. Reacting to the historic deal, Rishi Sunak, inset, said: "The Conservatives are delivering on our Brexit freedoms to grow the economy. "If we hadn't defeated Keir Starmer's campaign to reverse Brexit, this simply would not have been possible." Ms Badenoch said there was "so much potential" to unleash from joining the group. She added: "This is the fastest growing region. The Asia Pacific is going to be responsible for at least 50 per cent of global growth expected between now and 2035." Officials estimate the deal will come into force in the second half of next year, when the UK becomes a voting member of the bloc. Business lobby group the British Chambers of Commerce said: "We see particular relevance for small and mediumsized businesses in reduced costs to import components from member countries to use in manufactured goods for export."
