   Many benefits of Brexit; Letters East Anglian Daily Times July 20, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 26 Length: 232 words Body   JOHN Dell wrote (June 26, Johnson's role in Brexit) that time and time again we hear only of the damage Brexit is doing to our country. There is a reluctance to look for the good things from Brexit and not all of our troubles are Brexit related. In my opinion, there is considerable damage being done to us by ongoing strikes, for example. But the obvious Brexit benefit for us was the Covid vaccine which I believe was rubbished by our EU friends who then wanted to prevent us from importing it. But there are benefits to being out of the EU. Germany is in recession and has told Brussels that the magic money tree is not being continued and that member countries will need to either raise taxes or find efficiencies. We have escaped compensating the member Mediterranean countries (who include France, Spain and Italy) for damage done to their economies by illegal immigration. We have escaped being told by Brussels how many migrants we should accept and that we should pay fines if we refused to accept their numbers. So, life may not be perfect. A lot of the damage being done to us is self-inflicted. Just look at the lack of competence by the Bank of England in controlling inflation. But on the whole I'm glad we are out of the EU using our freedoms rather than chafing against foreign unelected bureaucrats who I believe would like to bend us to their wills.
