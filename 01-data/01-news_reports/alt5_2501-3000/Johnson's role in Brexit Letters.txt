   Johnson's role in Brexit; Letters East Anglian Daily Times June 26, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 24 Length: 276 words Body   MR Johnson's history of being 'economical with the truth' is well known. Until recently that was all just a supposition albeit one borne out by multiple episodes of a similar nature. But they had never been tested and proven in front of peers and the public. Last Monday that changed. A Parliamentary Committee presented a report to the House of Commons which established that our former Prime Minister not only lied to the Committee but also to Parliament and multiple times. The House of Commons voted to accept the report and the penalties imposed on Mr Johnson. Given that Mr Johnson had a long history of lying both before he became Prime Minister, indeed before he became an MP, I think it would be reasonable to assume that it is a wellestablished and probably lifelong pattern of behaviour. I mention that mainly to point out that Mr Johnson, of course, led the Leave Campaign and later, as Prime Minister fronted the 2019 General Election for the Conservatives primarily fought on the issue of Brexit. The Leave campaign had little interest in facts. Mr Gove, another of its leaders, memorably said in the midst of the 2016 campaign that "people have had enough of experts". We were told that if we voted to Leave the European Union then miraculously Britain would be reborn, realise its potential and become once again a world-class player on its own merit. Time and time again we hear only of the damage Brexit is doing to our economy, our environment and our country as a whole. Mr Rees-Mogg as Brexit Minister spent much time looking for and failing to find a Brexit benefit. Frankly it's not surprising he failed given its main author. JOHN DELL, Shotley.
