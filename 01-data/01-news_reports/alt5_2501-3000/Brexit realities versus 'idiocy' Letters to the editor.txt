   Brexit realities versus 'idiocy'; Letters to the editor The Press and Journal June 13, 2023 Tuesday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Aberdeen Journals Ltd All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 26,27 Length: 270 words Body   Sir, - George Emslie (Letters, June 8) delivers another self-indulgent effusion of nonsense. His description of the SNP and EU leaders of being guilty of "Venezuelastyle" preaching is ludicrous given that Venezuela has suffered economic collapse, hyperinflation and a humanitarian crisis. Neither Scotland nor the EU conforms to this dystopian description. Until Brexit, Britain was a participating and influential EU member with the ability to make sovereign decisions: how else can you explain Brexit? I cannot recall an instance of Britain being "dictated to by the European Commission". On what basis does he envisage an independent Scotland, on attaining EU membership, being treated in this way? Perhaps he can enlighten me. For his edification, the EU Parliament comprises 705 elected members: a vivid contrast to the House of Lords with 776 unelected members. Furthermore, the EU's accounts are audited annually by the European Court of Auditors, an independent auditor representing the interests of EU taxpayers. Did the EU attempt to hijack the London Stock Exchange? If Mr Emslie is referring to the attempted merger with Deutsche Borse, this was blocked by European regulators. The greatest threat to an already shrinking London stock market, identified by entrepreneur Hermann Hauser, co-founder of ARM, is "Brexit idiocy". Pleasingly, an anti-Brexit momentum is growing. According to YouGov, twothirds of Britons are "less proud" of the UK than five years ago. They feel the country is in decline, with 61% in favour of reversing Brexit. Will "patriotic" Mr Emslie be the last Brexiteer standing? Ian D McCormick, Aboyne. Load-Date: June 13, 2023  End of Document
