   'DISGRACEFUL' Fury as doctor behind strike action appears to call Brexit voters racist thesun.co.uk June 28, 2023 Wednesday 11:01 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS,POLITICS,BREXIT,CONSERVATIVE PARTY,EXCLUSIVES,GPS AND DOCTORS SURGERIES,NHS,STRIKES,THE SUN NEWSPAPER,TWITTER; Version:2 Length: 238 words Byline: Natasha Clark Body                        A DOCTOR behind NHS strike action appeared to call Brexit voters racist and accused the Tories of “enabling pond life”.                    Mike Henley, the deputy chairman of the Consultants Committee and a member of the BMA, made the remarks in response to a pronoun debate on Twitter.  He wrote: “In the same way that Brexit enabled racists, the Tory leadership contenders falling over themselves to ‘wage war on woke’ is enabling another section of pond life.”  He also said the UK had been “manipulated into Brexit by Russian influence and money to destabilise Europe”. Tory  MP Ben Bradley called the Derby -based NHS  surgeon’s comments “utterly disgraceful”. Fellow Tory Paul Bristow, who is on the Health Select Committee, accused the BMA of being “more interested in knocking the Government than getting a fair and reasonable pay award”. He added: “They should call off the strike, negotiate in good faith and prioritise patient care.” It comes after consultants  on an average salary of £128,000 voted to strike for a 35 per cent pay rise.  They will walk out in England on July 20 and 21. Junior doctors  are holding strikes from July 13 to 18. Last night the BMA claimed the comments, made last year, were not calling Brexit  voters racist or saying Tories were “pond life”.  It said its focus was on fixing pay and “not being diverted to discussing personal and often historic activity on social media sites”. Load-Date: July 24, 2023  End of Document
