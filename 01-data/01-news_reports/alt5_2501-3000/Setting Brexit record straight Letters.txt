   Setting Brexit record straight; Letters Evening News (Norwich) July 1, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; TEASERS; Pg. 18 Length: 226 words Body   THE constant flow of claims that Brexit continues to decimate our trade with Europe is worrying. That is if it is true. If our exports to Europe have fallen to the extent that the remoaners would have us believe that we would already be in recession. I am grateful to Derek Richardson, (letters, June 24), for bringing to our attention that not only are our exports to Europe at a record high, but we have the lowest unemployment figure amongst European nations. Then there is the widely spread myth that crops are rotting in the ground as Brexit is the sole reason for low numbers of migrant workers. Those for whom Brexit is the root of all evil do not take into account other factors such as Covid which led to many workers returning home. This leads me to an article in the Agricultural Review in which an established vegetable producer has invested in new machinery to offset reliance on migrant labour. He said the company's traditional pool of labour had dwindled long before Brexit, due to strengthening economies in countries such as Poland lowered the need to seek work abroad. If we have seasonal jobs for unskilled labour why do we see many fit young people wandering the streets with nothing to occupy them? There, surely is a vast pool of immigrant workers who could help with seasonal employment peaks. BILL WOOLNOUGH, Hilton Rd, Swanton Morley. Load-Date: July 1, 2023  End of Document
