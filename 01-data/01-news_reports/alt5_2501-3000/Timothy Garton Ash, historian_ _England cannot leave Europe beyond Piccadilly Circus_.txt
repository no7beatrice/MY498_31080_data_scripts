   Timothy Garton Ash, historian: "England cannot leave Europe beyond Piccadilly Circus". CE Noticias Financieras English January 5, 2024 Friday  Copyright 2024 Content Engine, LLC. All Rights Reserved Copyright 2024 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved Length: 2113 words Body            Europa (Taurus) is an unusual book, written with rage and illusion, as if its author, Timothy Garton Ash (1955), were writing a letter to his father, who fought against Hitler in a war that was decisive for the existence of today's Europe. Garton Ash has been traveling for half a century in search of that paternal trace, which is multiplied in every corner of a continent to which his own country, the United Kingdom, once belonged, and to which he predicts a European future once again, like the one his own father enjoyed...          There is not a line in this book, in terms of the memory that drives it, that has not been lived by the author. This adds to his writing, which is fast and deep, like that of his admired Stefan Zweig in The World of Yesterday, a verisimilitude that sometimes reaches the extreme of the emotion that surrounds the different events lived by what is now called the European Union.          We spoke on Zoom, and at all times it seemed that we had the author of the book next to us, laughing and telling, or serious and listening. An English academic and, as such, a meticulous teller of true stories... in the first person. Q. This is Europe written in the first person          A. I only needed fifty years to write it. Half a century attending the great events, meeting many people, worrying about Europe... And it is a love letter to Europe. As well as a letter from a European concerned about the fate of the continent he loves. Q. A lover of Europe.          A. That's right, someone who thinks that we have built the best Europe we could ever have and that this Europe is under a lot of tension at the moment. Q. Are these tensions for you disappointments, pending accounts? What do you miss today of the European spirit?          A. The two leitmotifs of my life have been Europe and freedom. When I started traveling in Europe I was very young, in the early 1970s, when most of the continent was still living under dictatorships throughout Southern Europe. I don't need to remind a Spaniard of that, exactly. Then we have had an extraordinary history of freedom and democracy, as well as the establishment of the European Union, where many states now converge... Since 2008 we have had a real cascade of crises, starting with the global financial crisis, followed by the Eurozone crisis. Then there were the problems of Georgia and Crimea; the annexation of the latter by Russia was not just a disappointment. It was a call to my fellow Europeans to stand up, mobilize and defend a better Europe... A call to defend the best Europe we have ever had... Most of us still want that Europe. Q. You are a historian, but you have the soul of a journalist. You arrive in Spain [when we do this interview] when the news breaks that the prime minister who called for what would later become the Brexit, David Cameron, has just been appointed foreign minister of his country... News that must have shaken you... How do you see this very English episode?          A. I find it festive, to begin with... Thank you for understanding that I am also a journalist... I wear both jackets, mine is a friendly relationship with history and with journalism: it is a very tense border... It is true that this English news is very interesting, but nothing is comparable at the moment to the political moment in which Spain is immersed... So here, like fifty years ago all over Europe, in my little notebook I am taking notes of what is happening, as I have done all my life. As for Mr. Cameron... It is one of the strangest political situations I can remember in recent years... We have overcome the Brexit, and in fact this current government is taking small steps to get back closer to the European Union. Cameron was never a Euro-enthusiast, but it was unthinkable that he would be the one to lead us out of the European Union. He was more of a Euroskeptic. That he has now been appointed Foreign Secretary is a sign of absolute desperation on the part of the British government. It is evidence that this government is in its death throes and that the return to Europe is going to start next year, when the prime minister is changed.  The British government is in its last throes and the return to Europe will begin next year, when the prime minister is changed. Q. In your book you say you are angry with your country... In that anger you include Cameron, obviously. What other angers are there in your displeasure with Great Britain?          A. Quite simply: England cannot leave Europe beyond Picadilly Circus... It cannot leave London, we are and will always be Europe. Ours is a European country, where we have always been and where we will always be... What is more: the Brexit vote was anything but inevitable. It was perhaps 35% or 40% of the population, including my father, whom I include in the book, who would have voted for Brexit... Contributing to the failure was the weakness of the campaign in favor of remaining in Europe. That is why I hold Cameron responsible, and that the Labour leader at the time was Jeremy Corbin. If the Labour Party had had another leader surely the story would have been very different and the United Kingdom would be in Europe and in the European Union. There is still much to fight for. Incidentally, it is clear that the British Government has been instinctively involved in supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia. In other words, Britain has simply not left Europe. The real chapter of Britain's return to the EU will come after the next election. We are now in an intermission. Q. It is interesting to think that a group of people would decide something as serious and as long-lasting as to break away from a commitment that seemed to be a consequence of the common war against Hitler...          A. Oneofkey points I try to get across in the book is that we Europeans knew where history was heading. The Berlin Wall fell, the Cold War ended, and yet we had the Brexit, and all of this was by virtue of individual attitudes that had an immense impact, because, in effect, individuals have a very important weight in history... In this case, the populisms that pushed for the very dissolution of our relationship with Europe ended up producing our separation.  The populisms that led to the dissolution of our relationship with Europe ended up producing our separation. Q. In this book, you deal with all these episodes, sometimes with undoubted personal melancholy... In the beginning you went to Europe in search of the traces of your father, a soldier in the war against Nazism. And you have been asking all over Europe, to write, as I said before, a very first-person book. Radically personal. What led you to get so involved humanly with this story?          A. It is my leitmotiv, Europe is my struggle and my life. It was fifty years of my life, traveling constantly. This is a book about the real Europe, the real Europe, the Europe of each and every one of its countries, of its different cultures and of its different languages, gastronomies, ways of being of men and women... It is not a book about Brussels or the European Union... And the fact is that we now have a generation of young Europeans who have grown up in the same common space of peace, of relative freedom, where they can travel unhindered from one side of the continent to the other... They can leave on Friday morning and spend the weekend in another part of Europe and nobody stops them or asks them where they come from or where they are going... My challenge as a young man was different, now everything is different and everything is better. To tell all this, as it was, and now as it is, can only be done from the perspective of a writer who, from a young age, is witnessing this immense human flow. Q. It is a very shared story.          A. It is the story of my friends in East Germany, before the Berlin Wall fell, and it is the story that follows, so it is the story of the European heart, from what the youngest people felt to what the new young people are living now, those who were born when Europe was already the Europe we all know. Q. You have made a book with people, unknown or new, anonymous beings with whom you have shared uncertainties as if they were all from the same homeland.          A. I thought about the idea of this book for a long time. You can check it on my website, where there are even my oldest notes related to this long journey since the early 70's... I had to pile them up on all the stairs of my house because I kept a huge amount of material. Since 2015 I decided to put in order this memory, which goes from that Yugoslavia to this Ukraine, passing through the feeling of threat that has always existed about the future of this great idea... Now that I have passed by the Retiro, in Madrid, I have seen a big banner celebrating that great European book that is The World of Yesterday, by Stefan Zweig... Europe was falling apart, and would be remade later, when he wrote that memory of what was happening.... Q. And he committed suicide without that Europe of dreams taking place          A. For a few years, it is true, he missed it... He died in 1942. Europe was totally destroyed, literally destroyed... Stefan Zweig was so desperate that he committed suicide after finishing that book... What I claim now is not Zweig's fatalism, the impulse he had before reaching his worst conclusions, the ones that led him to death, but the optimism of someone like my dear Václav Havel, who believed, for example, in the hope that saved Czechoslovakia, even in times of despair, when it seemed impossible that, seven years later, his country would proclaim him its president. I believe in that spirit.  What I am calling for now is not the fatalism of Stefan Zweig, but the optimism of my dear Václav Havel. Q. So to speak, you write after Stefan Zweig's pessimism, with Havel's optimism and with the awareness that there is no turning back for Europe          A. I agree... This book is now present in twenty-one different editions, all over Europe... I have been traveling in pursuit of each of these European editions. And in each country I see a kaleidoscope of what I call a tapestry of Europe with different tastes... Just as Zweig himself had, because each of us has his own European Zweig, each from each country... It's the same book, then, but each one contains different national versions of the story. The whole explains Europe. A unity, from Rome, in diversity, a very difficult balance that was made possible by the European Union, a miracle that was put to work in the midst of skepticism that no longer exists. Q. This book is also a walk through solitude. For Europe aspires to be a companion, but in many moments of this time it has been loneliness and incomprehension. It is not a raft of oil. Sometimes it looks like a raft of boiling oil. In fact, the Hungarian Viktor Orban has told you that you have not understood anything, after reading your book. How do you see now the power relations that manage Europe?          R. If it were an easy path it would have been very boring, so it is very good that there is competition of ideas, such as those put forward by Orban, of course, who was a student of mine at Oxford... He is in fact the man who has destroyed democracy in Hungary... If we think that European values are only those of the Enlightenment, which are in article two of the Treaty on European Union, we would be wrong, because, and it pains me to say it, Orban is right: there are also other elements, such as xenophobia, ecclesiastical tradition, nationalism, which are also, so to speak, European values... Just a few weeks ago a government, the Polish government, which had the values that Orban defends, anti-European, nationalist, anti-German, retrograde, reactionary, was removed from power by those who defend the European values that we are defending... The Polish people have swept it away in the most beautiful way, simply by voting in massive numbers. More young people voted than older people and more women than men... It is a fantastic European moment, which gives me reason to feel hope that the set of European values I believe in will in the end prevail.  Orban was a student of mine at Oxford. He is the man who has wrecked democracy in Hungary. Q. Professor Garton Ash, if Europe were a person, what would be its characteristics? Would it be a friend of yours, an enemy of yours, would it be a playmate? Would it be a dream?          A. She would be an incredibly fascinating woman. A brilliant woman capable of enormous courage and extraordinary actions.  'Europe.
