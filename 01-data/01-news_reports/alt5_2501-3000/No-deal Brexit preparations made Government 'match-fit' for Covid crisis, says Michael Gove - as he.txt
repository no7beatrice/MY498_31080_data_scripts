   No-deal Brexit preparations made Government 'match-fit' for Covid crisis, says Michael Gove - as he dismisses claims that ministers' focus on leaving the EU harmed pandemic readiness before 2020 MailOnline July 13, 2023 Thursday 2:25 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:1 Length: 585 words Byline: Greg Heffer, Political Correspondent For Mailonline Body   Cabinet minister hails how ministers and officials had learned to work 'at pace'                      Michael Gove told the Covid Inquiry today that Britain's preparations for a no-deal Brexit helped make Whitehall 'more match-fit' to deal with the pandemic crisis. The Cabinet minister, who held a senior role during work on leaving the EU without an exit deal, hailed how ministers and officials learned to work 'at pace'. Mr Gove, now the Levelling Up Secretary, stressed it was 'helpful' for ministers and officials to have had experience of operating at such speed prior to the pandemic. He also dismissed claims that work on a no-deal Brexit prior to coronavirus outbreak in 2020 had harmed the UK's pandemic preparedness. Mr Gove, who has held a series of top roles in Government, suggested Brexit made Britain able to 'significantly better' deal with the Covid crisis. In his first appearance before the Inquiry, Mr Gove outlined his role in chairing the powerful 'XO' Cabinet committee after Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019. He described how the select group of senior ministers and officials met daily to help prepare the UK for Brexit, including the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal. 'One of the challenges that Whitehall and ministers faced is, because there was a deadline - of course the deadline was extended - but because there was a deadline, we knew that with a ticking clock at our back we needed to proceed at pace,' Mr Gove told the Inquiry. 'That meant the normal tempo of papers being produced within Whitehall was accelerated. 'I think it's fair to say that outside crisis situations or big projects in which the prime minister has invested an enormous amount of interest, the rhythm that XO maintained - the daily battle rhythm - would be difficult to sustain. 'But I do believe it was helpful for all of government to be operating at that pace because we made government more match-fit overall for the terrible events this inquiry has been set up to look at.' Mr Gove also argued that planning for Brexit 'was some of the best preparation' possible for the pandemic. 'The nature, the pace and the intensity of the work undoubtedly placed pressure on individuals and the system, but it also ensured a greater degree of match fitness for what none of us anticipated but what was to come the year after,' he added. 'I would argue that the skills acquired, honed and refined during EU exit preparation helped us not only to have an organisational system that was better in dealing with the crisis, but having a cadre of people who'd been through an intense process that enhanced their ability to respond. 'The preparation for EU exit in and of itself was some of the best preparation that could have been undergone for any future crisis.' Last month, the Inquiry heard from former Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon that planning for a no-deal Brexit took resouces away from preparations for a possible pandemic prior to 2020. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has also blamed the fallout from Brexit for dominating ministers' time ahead of the Covid crisis. But Mr Gove, who co-fronted the Vote Leave campaign with Mr Johnson at the EU referendum, dismissed such claims. Asked if he accepted that preparing for Brexit had had a 'detrimental effect' on pandemic planning, he replied: 'No. 'Because I haven't seen any activity that has been identified that would have enable us to significantly better deal with the Covid pandemic that did not occur as a direct result of EU exit.'
