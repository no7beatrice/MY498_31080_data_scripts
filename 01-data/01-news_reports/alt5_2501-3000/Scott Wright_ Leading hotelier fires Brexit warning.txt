   Scott Wright: Leading hotelier fires Brexit warning Herald Scotland June 22, 2023 Thursday  Copyright 2023 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Length: 383 words Byline: Scott Wright Body   No matter how much the UK Government tries to make a virtue of Brexit, the decision to quit the European Union and so curb the freedom of people from the bloc to live and work on these shores continues to haunt one of Scotland-s most important industries. Stephen Leckie, chairman of the Scottish Tourism Alliance, declared today that staff recruitment continues to represent a -serious challenge- to the sector, stating that the -removal of a significant part workforce as a result of Brexit is curtailing the ability of businesses to operate with a full service, deliver the experiences we would wish to and invest in our product with the ambition we hold.- For anyone who has followed the ups and downs of the Scottish tourism industry in recent years, it will not be the first time they have heard a senior figure from the industry speak out about Brexit and its corrosive effect on its ability to hire the staff it needs. Indeed, only yesterday, Bill Costley, founder of Ayrshire-based Costley & Costley Hoteliers and a long-standing critic of Brexit, said the industry is plagued by a -dearth of talent-, telling The Herald: -There are not enough people to go round.- READ MORE: Nearly 40 jobs go as Glasgow construction supplier collapses Shutting off a vital pipeline of staff for Scottish industries such as tourism, hospitality, agriculture, and technology has been a major barrier to growth since the UK formally quit the European Union on January 31, 2020. But matters have since been compounded first by Covid and more recently a cost of doing business crisis, which has seen labour costs pushed higher still amid the ongoing shortage of staff across the economy. Mr Leckie is correct to call on the UK Government today to ease the crisis by staging a -meaningful intervention- with regard to working visas and immigration policy, stating that the shortage of staff when combined with -continued cost pressures on tourism and hospitality businesses- is undermining the sector-s ability to be profitable, enhance the quality of its product, and improve its competitiveness on the world stage. But as we know by now, it is highly unlikely any action will be taken by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and co, who continue to believe Brexit has been a success despite mounting evidence to the contrary.
