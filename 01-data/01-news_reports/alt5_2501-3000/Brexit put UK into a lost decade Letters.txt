   Brexit put UK into a lost decade; Letters Evening News (Norwich) June 30, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NLA Media Access Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: LETTERS; Pg. 22 Length: 237 words Body   ON June 20 Arthur Pooley wrote that Brexit is damaging UK trade performance which is the correct conclusion. On June 24 Derek Richardson wrote stating the opposite view which is incorrect. Let's take some statements from those authorities who produce detailed analysis of the picture. The centre of European Reform state that UK GDP is down 5.5%, investment is down by 11%, and trade is down by 7.0%. The Bank of England states that since Brexit the UK has lost growth of GDP in the order of 29bn which is equivalent to £1,000 per UK household. The Office of Budget Responsibility says the GDP will be down 4% over the longer term. Bloomberg quotes £100m in lost UK output. Exchange rates since Brexit $1.32 down to1.26 - the (EURO)1.36 down to 1.16. Yes, the EU has dipped into a small recession, but they were not flat lining like the UK. The EU has fallen back from a position of growth. I've only quoted a few sources; the list goes on and, in my search, I can find no positive statements of how the UK is doing. All analysts agree that Brexit has produced a negative economic result. These negative figures vary but none are small, and they all point the same way. Remember in addition there are all the other facets of culture, education, science, art and our world status that has also fallen. Brexit was a grave mistake, and the UK is now into what appears to be a lost decade. MICHAEL WOODHOUSE, Marston Lane, Eaton. Load-Date: June 30, 2023  End of Document
