   British Labour leader visits France with an eye on Brexit renegotiation CE Noticias Financieras English September 19, 2023 Tuesday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

The renegotiation of the agreement in several areas, including economic, scientific and security, will mark the meeting with the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, and will lay the foundations for a new relationship between London and Brussels in the event that the Labour victory in the next general election, predicted by all the polls, is confirmed.          Starmer has uncovered some of his cards in recent days, far from the prudence that has so far characterized his time in opposition. To the willingness to conclude an agreement with the EU on migration, expressed last week in a visit to Europol headquarters in The Hague, has been added his intention to review trade relations and open a new chapter in economic matters from 2025. "Almost everyone recognizes that the deal[Boris] Johnson came to is not a good deal: it's too meager," the Labour leader has pointed out in an interview to the 'Financial Times'.  International attrition          Starmer has ruled out a return to the customs union, but has shown his intention to review the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, negotiated by Johnson, as well as further rapprochement on energy and international mobility. "I feel very strongly that, since Brexit, there is a sense that not only have we left the EU, but we have somehow turned our backs on the world. Everywhere you go people feel the absence of the UK: once a major voice, now rarely consulted," he told 'Politico' on the sidelines of an international gathering of left-wing leaders held this weekend in Montreal and also attended by Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.          Tuesday's meeting with Macron marks a new step in Starmer's strategy to reposition the UK on the international stage. A path that the current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has also tried to take with the rapprochement with powers such as the United States, China and India in recent months and with new agreements with the EU after a period of international disrepute under Johnson's leadership. However, the Conservatives have been quick to criticize the plans of the Labour leader, whom they accuse of wanting to return to the pre-Brexit model and who they remind of his support for remaining in the EU club during the referendum campaign.          The Trade and Cooperation Agreement is up for review in 2025, but it remains to be seen to what extent the European authorities are willing to modify it. Although Starmer's will is to strengthen ties with Brussels in the event of winning the elections, there will be no hot air in the EU capital when it comes to demanding a counterpart from the London government, which would establish a balance between the rights and obligations of the two parties. In the case of migration, the Labour leader has shown himself in favor of reaching an agreement with the EU for the distribution of immigrants, but has refused to enter into the model of quotas proposed by the European Commission to the member countries. This has raised questions about the viability of a possible agreement.  Atypical meeting          The UK's fit in Europe in the post-Brexit era is the main topic on Tuesday's agenda in Paris, in a meeting that has been described as atypical, as the French president does not usually hold meetings of this type with opposition leaders from political families other than his own. Starmer's lead in the polls, about 20 points over the Conservative Party, has justified the exception, although the British government has tried to play down the matter and pointed out that meetings between heads of government and foreign opposition leaders are commonplace. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama already did it with Tony Blair and David Cameron, respectively, before they won the elections.          The French government has insisted that the relationship between Macron and Sunak is fluid and stressed that the meeting with Starmer is part of the normality in relations between the two countries, just over a year before the general election in the UK. In a gesture of cordiality, Macron himself informed the British 'premier' of his meeting with the Labour leader at the G20 summit held earlier this month in New Delhi.
