Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday morning to launch Reform’s election campaign, Mr Tice also claimed a Labour  government would usher in “Starmergeddon ”.  He claimed Sir Keir Starmer  would drag Britain back toward the EU as he branded the opposition and the Tories  as both part of the same “socialist coin”.

Leonard Farruku was found unresponsive on board the accommodation vessel at Portland Port, Dorset, on December 12. An inquest opened by Dorset coroner Rachael Griffin heard that a post-mortem examination found he had died from “compression of the neck” caused by “suspension by ligature”. The hearing last month was told there were no suspicious circumstances and the case was adjourned for a full hearing to be held at a later date. Mr Farruku’s family set up a GoFundMe page to raise £10,000 to repatriate the 27-year-old’s body, which remains in a Dorset mortuary. By Wednesday, the campaign had reached £18,784.

The failed London  mayoral candidate, who attended a lockdown-breaking “jingle and mingle”  Christmas party, said “she can’t be both”. Speaking to GB News  about the former countdown star, Lord Bailey said : “On one hand… she’s a serious political commentator, and then if you look at her Instagram it’s all pictures of her bum and of her boobs. So what is it here?

In a move that piles yet more pressure  on Rishi Sunak , Reform leader Richard Tice  vowed to field candidates in every constituency in England, Wales and Scotland. Speaking at the party’s election campaign launch on Wednesday, he insisted Reform would not do a deal with the Conservatives under any circumstances. In 2019 the group formerly known as the Brexit Party stood down hundreds of candidates to help Boris Johnson secure a majority.

But the MP for Ashfield, in Nottinghamshire, said that Mr Farage was doing “fantastic things” and had to stand in the next election and become party leader for Reform to make inroads. Mr Tice said: “Lee is very worried, he’s terrified that we’re going to basically put him out of the job. “The honest truth is, there are quite a number of Tory MPs in a similar position -stop staying with the toxic Tories, stop defending the indefensible, be brave, be bold, come on over.”                      Reform rules out Tory pact                    Reform UK has ruled out entering into any electoral pacts with the “terrified” Tories as Rishi Sunak came under fresh pressure from his political opponents to call a general election. Richard Tice, the leader of the Nigel Farage-linked party, said he could be “absolutely categoric” there will be no deals despite the alleged pleading of some Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, demanded that the Prime Minister should launch a general election for May rather than “clinging on to power”. Holding a press conference near Parliament, Mr Tice said the country wants to go to the polls “sooner rather than later” as voters want to “punish the Tories for breaking Britain”. “The truth is the Tories are terrified,” he told an audience gathered at a plush hotel on Wednesday. “Yes, in the new year the special pleading has already started: ‘Oh, please don’t stand here, please don’t stand there, I’m one of the nice guys, I believe in everything that you believe in.”’                      No money for public service reform in Scotland budget -Cosla                    The Scottish government’s budget contains no money for public service reform, local council leaders have complained.They also hit out at increases in the government’s “internal costs” while their own budgets are disproportionately affected by cuts to capital funding. Cosla, (the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities) has been voicing its unhappiness with the budget following a meeting of council leaders in December. Deputy first minister Shona Robison’s budget offered £144 million to local authorities as compensation for freezing council tax. However, Cosla said this would not fully fund the freeze, warning services would be at “breaking point” with “cuts in every community”.In a statement on Wednesday, Cosla said: “The budget as it stands leaves not a single penny for transformational public service reform – there is very limited scope for a focus on spend to save. “The 2024-25 budget shows a clear difference between the treatment of local government and other public bodies, with local government disproportionately impacted by cuts to capital funding.”                      ‘Stop the boasts’ is a good soundbite on immigration, but what would Labour actually do?                    “Stop the boasts” is a good soundbite on immigration, but what would Labour actually do?

The Reform UK  leader, 59, held a news conference on Wednesday 3 January, where he lashed out at both Rishi Sunak  and the Labour leader. “We are facing a catastrophic cocktail of economic incompetence and cultural pillage that will be a disaster for the United Kingdom,” Mr Tice said on a potential Labour government. The party leader doubled down on his criticism, adding: “In every Labour Government, in every socialist way, they want more taxes, they want more of your money.

Richard Tice wraps up Reform UK press conference                    Richard Tice has wrapped up Reform UK’s press conference, after criticising Labour and the Tories. The party’s leader doubled down on his pledge to fight in every seat in the UK at the next election and warned against what he described as “Starmageddon” -claiming Labour’s plans for the country would bankrupt the country. He accused Rishi Sunak of failing on four out of his five pledges and urged the prime minister to call an election sooner rather than later. Despite rumours before the press conference, Nigel Farage did not make an appearance at the event although Mr Tice said he was “very confident” the party’s founder would have a role to play in the election campaign.                      ‘We will not step aside in any circumstances,’ Tice says                    Richard Tice has said “categorically” that the party will not do any deals with the Conservatives ahead of the next general election,Archie Mitchell reports. In 2019 Reform UK, then the Brexit Party, stood hundreds of candidates down to help the Tories win a majority. But Mr Tice told a press conference in London: “I can be absolutely categoric that we are not doing any deals with the Tories. We will stand everywhere in England, Scotland, Wales, absolutely under any circumstances.”                      Tice: I’m ‘very confident’ Farage will play a role                    Richard Tice is “very confident” his predecessor as leader Nigel Farage will take a formal role for Reform UK in this year’s general election, he told a press conference in London,Archie Mitchell reports. He said the former leader is still “assessing” what role he will play in the campaign, and that “nothing should be rushed”. “Patience is a virtue,” he said.

Reform, formerly the Brexit Party, poses a threat to the Conservatives, and the prospect of Nigel Farage returning in a prominent role risks adding to the threat. But, amid speculation he is considering a comeback, Mr Tice, who took over as leader of the party in 2021, said he looks forward to letting everybody know. “A good poker player does not show their hand too early, Nigel is the master of political timing, but I am very clear, the job at hand is so big, to save Britain, the more help Nigel is able to give in the election campaign the better,” Mr Tice said.

Tice: ‘Starmergeddon is a risk near you in 2024'                    The leader of Reform UK has claimed Labour and the Conservatives are both part of the same socialist coin in a bid to offer his party as an alternative, Archie Mitchell reports.

The two regions will be hardest hit by the government’s decision to freeze income tax thresholds -which have been branded “stealth” taxes -rather than raise them in line with inflation. About 1.1 million taxpayers in London and the South East will be pushed into the higher 40p rate of income tax by 2027-28, according to the research commissioned by the Liberal Democrats, first reported by the Financial Times. Just under 1mn people in the two regions will be dragged into paying income tax at the lower 20p rate, the research found. The analysis did not include numbers for the highest 45 per cent rate of tax.
