   Politics latest news: Public concern over immigration hits six-year high amid Rwanda plan battle telegraph.co.uk January 26, 2024 Friday 4:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 4273 words Byline: By Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor Body   Public concern about immigration has hit a six-year high, according to a new poll conducted by Ipsos.  The survey found that in December 2023 almost one in three people-29 per cent-believed immigration was an important issue for the UK.  That was up by seven points in just one month and represented the highest score recorded by the company on the issue since April 2017.  The survey also found that concern about immigration was higher among Tory supporters, with 52 per cent naming it as an important issue.  The findings illustrate the political importance of Rishi Sunak’s pledge to stop the boats and curb immigration numbers as the Prime Minister battles to get his Rwanda plan off the ground.  Immigration was the third most popular choice of respondents when asked what they believed to be the most important issues facing the UK. Inflation was top as it was selected by 34 per cent of people and the economy was second with 31 per cent.

Harriett Baldwin, the chairman of the Commons Treasury Committee, proposed tripling the number of MPs required to submit a no-confidence letter to the 1922 Committee to trigger a ballot. She wanted the threshold raised from 15 per cent to 50 per cent of the parliamentary party, or 175 MPs rather than 53. The idea is understood to have been discussed on Wednesday evening at a meeting of the 1922 Committee but was firmly rejected.

The chairman of the Conservative Party said: “On ITV’s This Morning Sir Keir Starmer could not say what he would do differently because he does not have a plan. All he does is just snipe from the sidelines. “He cannot say how he would fund his £28 billion-a-year spending spree and that is because he hasn’t got a plan. For as long as Labour continue to commit to their £28 billion of spending without a plan to pay for it, the British people should expect Labour to raise their taxes-tearing up the progress we’ve made on the economy and taking us back to square one.  “Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives are sticking to the plan which will deliver a stronger economy with lower taxes and a brighter future for you and your family.” You can see all of the updates on Sir Keir’s interview between 10.54 and 11.38 below.                      26 Jan 2024-02:23PM GMT                                         Join the conversation                     Readers in the comments section of today’s live blog are discussing Sir Keir Starmer’s remarks from this morning that “almost nothing daunts” him about the prospect of becoming prime minister (see the post below at 11.20).                       Andy F said: “Not at all daunted by becoming PM of a G20 country of almost 70 million people at this point in history? That’s about the scariest thing I could hear him say. I know he wants to project confidence, but all that statement does for me is suggest complacency and that he has no idea what he is taking on.”                      David W said: “Keir Starmer thinks he’s ahead in the polls because people are desperate for his socialist answers to the country’s problems instead of people’s disgust at the faux Tories’ ineptitude. I suppose Mr Starmer believes he can breeze into office, spraying an air freshener, hoping it will cover up the stink emanating from the establishment, and his party will be regarded as a breath of fresh air.”                      Bobs Y said: “The political scene is so depressing-Mr Starmer, boasting; Rishi Sunak, not the man for the job. The Tories are now a party run by careerist idiots and liberal frauds. ‘One Nation Conservative’ is an oxymoron and pathetic. Everyone, still terrified of switching to Reform, clinging to the sinking wreck of the Tories in the hope of a miracle change. It’s not going to happen.” You can join the conversation in the comments section here.                        26 Jan 2024-02:02PM GMT                                         BBC does not have 'God-given right' to exist, says Tory chairman                    The chairman of the Conservative Party has said the BBC does not have a “God-given right” to exist. In an interview for the Telegraph’s Politics newsletter (you can sign up here ), Richard Holden raised questions about the impartiality of the national broadcaster and said it too often pursued “blind alleys” after a review of its output suggested bias in coverage of some issues. Taking questions from Telegraph subscribers for an interview with the Politics newsletter, Mr Holden said: “Some aspects of the BBC are things they do really well. I actually really like its regional news coverage, and the World Service side of things is fundamentally important for Britain. “But does it go down some blind alleys at times, a bit like the Civil Service does? Absolutely, and they need to really think about that. “I think that the BBC needs to properly, a bit like a lot of other institutions, stop thinking about itself, stop believing it’s got a God-given right to exist, and actually reflect the broadest views of British society. That doesn’t mean it’s got to go down every rabbit warren going – but it needs to understand the country that it’s there to serve.”                      26 Jan 2024-01:48PM GMT                                         No obvious way back for Sunak and Tories, says pollster                    There is no obvious route back for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives before the next general election, a polling expert has warned. Scarlett Maguire of JL Partners argued Downing Street was not able to escape the “underlying truth” behind the call by Sir Simon Clarke, a former housing secretary, for Mr Sunak to resign as the Tories continue to trail Labour by around 20 points. Speaking to The Telegraph’s Politics newsletter (you can sign up here ), Ms Maguire said Sir Simon’s one-man revolt was “a bit of a damp squib” but insisted his fundamental point about the plight of his party could not be ignored. “The way it has been dismissed out of hand by MPs might have even made Sunak safer in his party, for the time being,” she said. “But Sunak and the Conservatives can’t get away from the underlying truth. They are suffering terribly in the polls, and it doesn’t seem like there is much of a route back to them before a general election – whenever in 2024 it is called.”                      26 Jan 2024-01:39PM GMT                                         Sunak’s leadership in ‘real danger’ over Budget and by-elections                    Rishi Sunak faces a “pretty bleak” few months ahead that could pose a “real danger” to his leadership, a polling expert has said. Chris Hopkins, director of political research at the polling firm Savanta, said he could “absolutely see the appeal” to Tory MPs of replacing Mr Sunak before the general election, which is expected later this year. Sir Simon Clarke, a former housing secretary, called on the Prime Minister to quit earlier this week in the wake of a revolt over his Rwanda Bill which saw more than 60 Tory MPs defy the Government to call for a tougher approach. Mr Hopkins told The Telegraph’s Politics newsletter (you can sign up here ): “I think there is potentially a real danger for Rishi Sunak. I can absolutely see the appeal to the Conservative Party of rolling the dice on a new leader. “There is still a path to Rishi Sunak getting a more respectable general election result, depriving Labour of an outright majority, but it does require everything to go right for him and the Government – and time is running out. “Add in things like the Budget on the horizon, local election results, by-election results that are expected to be pretty bleak for the Conservative Party, and it’s hard to see that the disquiet is going to go away. The louder that disquiet gets, I think the more Conservative MPs would be tempted just to roll the dice.”                      26 Jan 2024-12:53PM GMT                                         Downing Street says all potential trade deals must work for UK                     No 10 insisted leaving the European Union had given the UK greater control over trade negotiations. A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the “benefit of our independent trading status [is] that we are able to insist on the detail of each and every deal to ensure that it works specifically in the UK as interests”. She said: “We remain open to restarting talks in the future, where we can build a trading relationship that benefits businesses and consumers on both sides. “There’s no schedule for those, we’ve paused negotiations given that was not what was being presented to us. But we’re open to speaking again, where we have a deal that’s in our interests.”                      26 Jan 2024-12:35PM GMT                                         No 10 'open' to restarting Canada trade talks                     Downing Street said it is “open” to restarting trade talks with Canada in the future. A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said: “We will only negotiate deals that deliver for the British people, and that we reserve the right to pause negotiations where progress is not being made. We’re open to restarting talks with Canada in the future.” But she added it was important to ensure “those negotiations and the deal works in British interests”.                      26 Jan 2024-12:20PM GMT                                         SNP claims Brexit ‘damaged UK’s potential for global trade’                     The SNP claimed Brexit had “damaged the UK’s potential for global trade” as it responded to UK-Canada trade talks collapsing (see the post below at 08.46).  Richard Thomson, the SNP’s international trade spokesman, said: “In the same week the Tories tried to pass the buck on US-UK Trade Deal negotiations breaking down, the UK’s trade talks with Canada have come to a halt. Trade with the EU also faces difficulties with new import controls coming into play next week. “The common denominator here is the UK Tory government, and the reason for all of this mess is Brexit. Westminster’s Brexit has damaged the UK’s potential for global trade and has dragged Scotland’s economy down with it.”                      26 Jan 2024-12:11PM GMT                                         Labour accuse Tories of 'another significant failure' after UK-Canada trade talks collapse                     Labour accused the Tories of “another significant failure” following the news that trade talks between the UK and Canada have collapsed (see the post below at 08.46).  Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business and trade secretary, said the lack of a deal represented “another blow to the British economy”.  He said: “This is very concerning news and another significant failure from the Conservatives to honour their promises. Rather than strengthening our trading position post-Brexit these failures have left us in a weaker position, particularly for the automotive sector. “This is another blow to the British economy because of Conservative incompetence. It is clear that they are unable to deliver what we need to get our economy growing. “Labour would pursue a proper trade strategy, focusing on the UK’s strengths and working to ensure trade supports our industrial and foreign policy objectives while protecting our high standards.”                      26 Jan 2024-11:38AM GMT                                         UK needs a ‘reset moment’ to restore public trust in politicians, says Starmer                     British politics needs a “reset moment” to restore public trust in politicians, Sir Keir Starmer said this morning.  The Labour leader was told during an interview on ITV’s This Morning programme that the public had potentially never been more distrusting of politicians than now.  Asked how that trust could be restored, Sir Keir said: “I think you have identified probably the single biggest problem in politics at the moment which is when we say we want to rebuild the NHS and make it fit for the next 75 years, people don’t say ‘I don’t like that’, what they do say is either ‘things are so broken now after 14 years of this Government I don’t think it is possible’, sort of defeatism, or they say ‘we have heard it all before and don’t believe you’.  “We have to come in, we have to explain what we are going to do, be mission-driven on it and in the end it is the actions that we take that will persuade people.”  He added: “We need a reset moment and one of the things I want to try and achieve if we get the chance is to restore the idea that politics is about service.”                       26 Jan 2024-11:20AM GMT                                         Prospect of becoming PM is not daunting, insists Starmer                     Sir Keir Starmer said “almost nothing daunts” him about the prospect of becoming prime minister but he admitted he is worried about the impact the job could have on his children.  Asked if he and his family were ready for him to become PM, Sir Keir told ITV’s This Morning programme: “I am never letting you near my shadow cabinet because every week I have to say to them ‘ignore the polls, fight like we are five points behind’.  “But obviously this is election year, this is the year we have been waiting for, working for, and Vic and I, we take one step at a time, we cross each bridge as we get to it.  “Almost nothing daunts me about the job I have got to do. The thing that worries me is our kids. My boy is 15, he is going on 16, doing his GCSEs and… our girl is 13 going on 16 and so they are at an age where what I do impacts them almost more than at any other age.”                      26 Jan 2024-11:11AM GMT                                         Pressure on NHS is ‘unbearable’ under Tories, says Starmer                     Sir Keir Starmer said a Labour government would introduce a “preventative model” for health care in order to alleviate some of the pressure on the NHS.  The Labour leader said the health service is currently “on its face” and a Labour government would “pick it back up”.  He said: “We have got to do some original thinking here because the pressure on the health service is just unbearable under this Government.”                       26 Jan 2024-11:06AM GMT                                         Labour promises to roll out 'no-go zones' in towns to tackle anti-social behaviour                     A Labour government would roll out no-go zones in towns to crackdown on anti-social behaviour, Sir Keir Starmer announced this morning.  The Labour leader told ITV’s This Morning programme: “I was in Milton Keynes with the police yesterday and I was really impressed with what they are doing to intervene to stop it.  “They are doing, it is almost no-go zones, and I am very keen on this, which is anti-social behaviour no-go zones in towns.  “What Milton Keynes are doing is where they have identified one and we if we come into power would have more of these no-go areas, zero tolerance areas for anti-social behaviour, they are patrolling every 15 minutes, really visible and so every 15 minutes they are back and it is having an effect.”  Labour is promising to introduce new powers to allow authorities to ban problem individuals from the zones and to crackdown on things like street drinking.                       26 Jan 2024-10:54AM GMT                                         Starmer admits knife crime worries                     Sir Keir Starmer said he worries about his children when they go out on their own because of the spectre of knife crime.  The Labour leader told ITV’s This Morning programme: “I have got a 15-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl. I worry, of course I do. I think any parent, particularly with teenaged children, worries about how safe they are on the streets, of course they do.  “I am not pleading anything special for my children, I am just expressing the concerns of a father which any parent would share across the country.”                      26 Jan 2024-10:30AM GMT                                         Labour: Time to ‘turn the page’ on Tories in power                     Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth said it was “time to turn the page” on the Conservative Party being in power.  The shadow paymaster general was asked whether he believed the Tories should change their leader after Sir Simon Clarke called for Rishi Sunak to be ousted.  He told the BBC’s Question Time programme: “After 14 years when people are paying more on their mortgage because the Conservatives wrecked the economy, when families are paying £1200 more on average on tax because of the weakness of the economy, when you can’t get an appointment with a GP or you are waiting longer for an operation on the NHS because of 14 years of the Conservatives, frankly the British public deserve better than this constant division, infighting, this sort of circular firing squad, this shambolic approach that we see from the Conservative Party.  “I just think now, after 14 years, what we have seen this week is the clearest reminder that people want change. It is time for change, it is time to turn the page on this mess because they simply cannot be trusted with the future nor make amends for the past.”  “The British public deserve better than… this sort of shambolic approach that we see from Conservative party”Labour’s Jonathan Ashworth calls for change, stating the Conservatives “cannot be trusted with the future, nor make amends for the past”#bbcqt https://t.co/T4ayL2Se9T pic.twitter.com/rfiSPpoHb3                      26 Jan 2024-10:03AM GMT                                         Public concern about immigration hits six-year high                    Public concern about immigration has hit a six-year high, according to a new poll conducted by Ipsos.

Alex Burghart, a Cabinet Office minister, defended the Prime Minister during an appearance on the BBC’s Question Time programme.  He said: “I think the truth is that Rishi Sunak has been doing an incredibly good job in very, very difficult circumstances.” Some members of the audience started laughing after this comment but Mr Burghart continued: “Hear me out.

The IMF says that the UK is going to grow faster than Japan, faster than Germany, faster than France, faster than Italy.

He told the BBC’s Question Time programme: “I think Simon is wrong. I have been slightly dreading this question… because Simon is one of my best friends… he knows my views and my views are not his.  “I think he is wrong and I think he has made a mistake.

Diplomats paused talks on Thursday with each side accusing the other of obstructing progress. The major sticking points in the deal are understood to be exports of British cheese and imports of beef from Canada to the UK.

The former shadow chancellor said Labour needed a “big U-turn” in order to take the sting out of Tory claims that Sir Keir would be irresponsible with the public finances.  The intervention comes after the pledge has already been watered down amid growing speculation it could be further downgraded.  Mr Balls told his Political Currency podcast: “So I would say there is going to be a U-turn and they won’t resile from a green plan, they won’t resile from the idea that that’s a way to growth and jobs, they won’t resile from the idea that you can spend now to strengthen the economy in the long term.  “But I think they’ll have to come off this £28 billion number. They’ll have to say the £28 billion number has gone, that it’s ditched or else they are going to be open to this attack.” He added: “You need something which looks like a U-turn. And I think that that’s what they’re going to end up doing. They’ve tried partial U-turns. It hasn’t worked. They need a big U-turn.” Labour originally promised to spend £28 billion a year on green investment from the first year of being in power. But that was reduced to a commitment to hit the annual number in the second half of a first term.  Sir Keir then appeared to downplay the significance of the pledge earlier this month  as he that “the mission isn’t writing a cheque, the mission is green power by 2030”.                      26 Jan 2024-08:24AM GMT                                         Osborne: Tory MPs 'not persuaded' Sunak can win next election                    George Osborne said Tory MPs are “not persuaded” Rishi Sunak can lead them to a general election victory.  But the former chancellor said it would be a “huge mistake” to oust the Prime Minister. He made the comments after Sir Simon Clarke’s call earlier this week for Mr Sunak to be replaced  stunned Westminster.  Mr Osborne told his Political Currency podcast: “Let me be absolutely clear, I think it would be a huge mistake to replace Rishi Sunak, who’s brought order and sense after years of chaos to the leadership of the Tory Party…” “Simon Clarke’s intervention is a sign that the Tory party is not persuaded”-George Osborne and Ed Balls discuss the implications of the failed coup against the PM. Listen to Political Currency: https://t.co/9qA6ffqmXP pic.twitter.com/TvEcs3phi0 He continued: “The only leadership strategy that works in the Tory Party is having a poll lead. The only thing that works as a unifying strategy is the promise that you might win the election. And you can announce any amount of policy, you can make any amount of promises to the Conservative Party. If you don’t look like you’re going to win, you’re going to have huge leadership problems.  “And I think this is a sign of that. Simon Clarke’s intervention is a sign that, you know, the party is not persuaded, partly because of this opinion poll funded by the Conservative Britain Alliance … the Conservative Party at the moment thinks it’s going to lose. And that is very destabilising for the leadership.” Load-Date: January 26, 2024  End of Document
