Campmates mourn Marvin’s departure from the jungle                    Sam Thompson, who has already made it clear that he’s a huge JLS fan, said in the Bush Telegraph: “Marvin, my brother, my rock.

I just couldn’t be happier to have had this experience [with him].” “I’m just so lucky I got to meet him.”                      This Morning’s Josie said she was shocked and added that Marvin has a “lovely energy” that was nice to have around. Tony added: “What a lovely, lovely man and just a voice of an absolute angel. I’m going to miss Marvin really bad.” After the remaining four campmates waved Marvin off, Sam taught Tony and Josie the JLS dance to “Everybody in Love” as a tribute.

He’s flew all the way from LA.’”  He added:: “The fight scenes were brilliant, I was able to have input. Sly had input, I had input, MBJ [Michael B Jordan] had input… three months we were together doing choreography, Mike hit me once, I clipped him once, but I clipped him on purpose as that’s where he supposedly gets knocked out.” He added: “Sly was amazing.
