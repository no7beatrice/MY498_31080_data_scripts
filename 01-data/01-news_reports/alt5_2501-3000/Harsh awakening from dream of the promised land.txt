   Harsh awakening from dream of the promised land The Australian September 28, 2023 Thursday Australian Edition  Copyright 2023 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved Section: COMMENTARY; Pg. 12 Length: 752 words Byline: BOOKSHELF DOMINIC SANDBROOK Body   It was four o'clock in the morning of Friday, June 24, 2016, and Nigel Farage had reached the promised land. "Dare to dream," he told his supporters, "that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom â€¦ This will be a victory for real people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people â€¦ Let June 23 go down in our history as our Independence Day." Seven years on, how does Farage's victory look? Well, the world can see that Brexit hasn't quite gone to plan. One poll this northern summer found just 31 per cent of the British public think it was right to leave the EU. Another found only 18 per cent of Leave voters think Brexit has gone well. And Farage himself? "We've mismanaged this totally," he told the BBC. "Brexit has failed." Peter Foster, formerly the Europe editor for Britain's The Daily Telegraph, agrees that something has gone badly wrong. Coolly, meticulously, Foster builds his case that business has been well and truly f..ked. He tells the story of Hampstead Tea, founded in 1989 to import high-grade Darjeeling from India. By 2016 its founder, Kiran Tawadey, was selling 100,000kg of tea a year to customers including supermarkets in Italy, France and Germany. Brexit wiped out her export trade overnight. "Her first consignment to Italy," Foster writes, "was stuck in customs for eight weeks before it was cleared." The Italians needed certificates and photographs for every shipment. When she went to a trade show in Germany, clients turned away once they heard she was based in Britain. In the end, Foster writes, "she took the advice of the HM Customs and Excise experts and shifted her business to the Netherlands". That says it all. What puzzles Foster is why so many businesses chose to "stay out of the political fray", creating a "climate of silence" during the Brexit negotiations. The answer, of course, is that they feared being denounced as anti-democratic "doomsters". So they abandoned the field to Britain's politicians - who, in Foster's view, could scarcely have done a worse job. With cold fury he lists the broken promises, the wild oversimplifications, the refusal to admit that a clean break would involve costs as well as benefits. He reserves particular scorn for those who denied there were downsides to Brexit, only to change their tune when it became personally convenient. Life outside the single market, the head of the Scotch Whisky Association predicted in 2016, would be "more complex, burdensome and uncertain" - a sentiment of which Brexit negotiator Lord Frost surely would disapprove had he not been the man who said it. And who's this ardent Remainer? "This is why that EU market is so precious; because we share the same regulations, we share the same rules over things like food safety, over animal health and welfare." Why, none other than Liz Truss - the same Truss, Foster dryly remarks, who later vowed to tear up 2400 EU regulations in 15 months. The only thing that saved her from breaking her promise is that she didn't last long enough to do so. Although I agree with almost every word of Foster's book, I became steadily more conscious of what was missing. His title implies that there was an alternative path on which Brexit could have gone right, but he never really says what it was. Neither does he pause to address the deeper causes, from the genuine anxiety about national sovereignty to the instinctive Euroscepticism of large swathes of the public. For all its merits, therefore, Foster's book reminds me of a Remain campaign pamphlet from 2016: at once intellectually plausible and emotionally unsatisfying. He is very good at showing how Britain's politicians consistently underplayed the inevitable trade-offs of leaving the EU, and he's excellent on why things such as VAT rules matter to small businesses. But Remainers were making these arguments in 2016 and millions of voters simply shrugged. VAT may be important, but it's boring. A skilful politician recognises both parts of that equation and crafts their message accordingly. In his closing pages Foster suggests it's time for another debate on the future of EU-UK relations, laying the foundations for a "new settlement" and recognising the need for realignment. But the nature of a national debate is that people are bound to argue back. And the lesson of 2016 is that to win that argument, the Remainers need to appeal to hearts as well as minds.
