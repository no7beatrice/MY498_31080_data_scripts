   ITV I'm A Celebrity viewers say the same thing about Nella Rose in 'relatable' jungle moment with JLS star manchestereveningnews.co.uk November 20, 2023 Monday 9:14 AM GMT  Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved  Section: TV; Version:1 Length: 748 words Byline: By, Ellie Kemp Highlight: The YouTuber and presenter, 26, amused fans as she met Marvin Humes for the first time Body   I'm A Celebrity returned to our screens on ITV with a jam-packed opening episode on Sunday evening November 19. Fans were excited to see the stellar line-up of famous faces as they got acquainted with the Australian jungle -and each other.  Amongst this year's line-up is actress Jamie Lynn Spears, TV personality Sam Thompson, ex politician Nigel Farage and JLS star Marvin Humes. Sunday night's launch episode saw each of the stars arrive down under as they were forced to take on challenges overseen by hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly, before entering the camp. The programme began with an entrance like no other, which saw This Morning presenter Josie Gibson, former UKIP leader Nigel and YouTuber Nella Rose dropped right into the middle of the scorching Australian Outback with no idea what they were facing. But viewers were particularly amused by presenter and YouTuber Nella as she met JLS star Marvin Humes. The 26-year-old gave him a big hug as she gushed: "Big fan! Squeeze me tight! It's happening!" Viewers quickly took to X, formerly Twitter, to share that they would've reacted in the exact same way if they ever met Marvin -who found fame with the boyband alongside members Aston Merrygold, Oritsé Williams and JB Gill after entering the X Factor in 2008.  @ZaraMcNally said: "Nella Rose hugging Marvin and not letting go is relatable content #ImACeleb" as @dahable__ agreed: "nella rose was so real for that SQUEEZE ME TIGHT id do the same for marvin humes". @grace_is_sugoi wrote: "Nella Rose hugging Marvin and saying BIG FAN fair play exactly what I'd do on entry as well #ImACeleb" as @kay3ann3 said: "Nella-Rose fan girling over Marvin...MOOD #ImACeleb" as @beccarosemaryx agreed: "Nella's reaction to meeting Marvin is a big mood #ImACeleb".

Nella, 26, regularly posts content around fashion, beauty and lifestyle on social media and boasts nearly 800,000 subscribers on YouTube and one million followers on TikTok. She moved to the UK with her parents from Belgium when she was seven years old. In 2015 she started a degree in sociology at the University of Leicester, graduating three years later in with a 2:1. It was while she was at university that began posting on YouTube in 2016. Away from social media she has built up a career as a TV presenter and was digital host of the BRIT Awards in 2022 and 2023. She has also presented Catfish on MTV since 2022. Elsewhere on Sunday's I'm A Celebrity, viewers reckoned they've spotted their winner already -after Josie made a Brexit jibe to Nigel. Having been dropped in the middle of nowhere ahead of their first task, Josie said to Nigel: "I did not think I'd be seeing you here Mr Farage". She then admitted: "I thought this was a good idea until they dropped us off in the middle of nowhere. I've never been so petrified." Nigel then replied: "It's something different in life, it's an adventure. It's a challenge, it's not going to be easy, but why not". But Josie then quipped: "It can't be worse than Brexit," in a cheeky dig to the politician. Nigel laughed: "Oh... didn't take long did it Didn't take long. I had a feeling we'd get a bit of that!" Laughing too, Josie said: "Only joking..." But as soon as the scene aired, viewers quickly took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to commend Josie for her Brexit comment. @onlyjoekin_ wrote: "It can't be worse than Brexit" Josie's already my winner #imaceleb." @SophieShipton_ said: "Can't be worse than Brexit, Josie you are a legend!!," as @fwaqa wrote: "I love Josie #ImACeleb." @x3ChelseaLouise wrote: "Josie Gibson is my winner already x #ImACeleb," as @BeckyMorrish13 agreed: "Ok Josie is already my winner #ImACeleb." @Alison_King_Fan typed: "not josie already making a brexit dig my winner #imaceleb," as @Derekosullivan_ said: "Hasn't even started yet and I just know Josie is gonna be an iconic camp mate." @thecaseybyrne also laughed at one of Josie's earlier comments: "I love snakes I've fallen enough with enough of them" I love Josie, what a wonderful human #ImACeleb #ImACelebrity."                      I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! continues Monday at 9pm on ITV1 and ITVX.                    Load-Date: November 20, 2023  End of Document
