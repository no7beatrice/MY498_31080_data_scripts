The 51-year-old Frenchman branded Farage's Brexit campaign as "shameful" as he pressed him for answers on how leaving the EU has helped the people of Britain. It came during a heated row in camp, the Mirror reports. Fred said he believes the average person has "lost out" as a result of the vote. But Farage disagreed.

He replied by referring to Johnson as "surprisingly introverted."  "I think he's one of the most disorganised human beings that possibly ever lived," continued Farage. "The whole thing's bloody chaos. Shambles." In the 'bush telegraph' Danielle said: "I found it so interesting to listen, sat with him picking his brains, having a chat. Then it got a little bit heated."  Fred asked Farage what the benefit of Brexit was, to which the former UKIP leader replied: "To know that we're independent, we stand on our own two feet in the world." Fred then countered: "Brexit was about immigration, I remember your poster. I thought it was shameful what you did, Nigel. Shameful." Farage replied: "Sadly, sadly it was absolutely true. It was a poster showing mass young men moving illegally across borders."  The exchange continued with Fred alleging Brexit was about "demonising migrants" and Farage insisting it was not. "In your view it was, but it wasn't," he said.  UKIP's controversial "breaking point" anti-EU poster in 2016 showed a long queue of migrants. A number of politicians attacked the 2016 poster, featuring a photo taken in Slovenia, with George Osborne saying at the time it had "echoes" of 1930s' literature and was "disgusting and vile". Reflecting on his row with Fred, Farage said in the bush telegraph: "I knew it wouldn't take long, I knew politics would rear its head as indeed it did. And Fred feels very strongly about it." During the conversation, Farage also said: "Brexit is about one thing and one thing only; being self-governing. "We're in charge. We can get it right, we can make an absolute mess of it but we're in charge and the people who make those decisions we can hire and fire at elections where they have real power." Fred said: "I think the average person in the UK has lost out because of what you've done." Farage said: "They haven't lost out." The First Dates star also addressed the conversation in the bush telegraph by saying it was "only a matter of time". Said Fred: "Look, Nigel Farage is in the jungle with me. We're bound to have this conversation. At the end of the day nothing is going to change, Nigel believes what he believes, I believe what I believe..."  I'm A Celeb viewers have now picked their winner following tonight's exchange between the pair. One said: "Fred attacking Nigel about politics, is one of the best moments I've seen on reality tv this year. He spoke for the people. Fred to win x."  While another added: "Fred not hiding his distaste for Farage, my winner."  Load-Date: November 20, 2023  End of Document
