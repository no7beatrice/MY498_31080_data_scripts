   THE SUN SAYS Sneaky Starmer cannot admit wanting to rewrite Brexit – but he can get much of the way there by stealth thesun.co.uk September 22, 2023 Friday 10:24 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS,OPINION,BREXIT,CONSERVATIVE PARTY,LABOUR PARTY,SUN SAYS,THE SUN NEWSPAPER; Version:2 Length: 493 words Byline: The Sun Body                                               Slippery Labour                                         WHO should we believe over Labour’s plan to neuter Brexit? Keir Starmer, caught off guard in Canada  admitting that as PM he would stick slavishly to EU  rules? Or shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves , sent out to smooth over his disastrous gaffe and reassure Leavers? Truth is, Starmer  has always loathed Brexit.  Labour  cannot admit wanting to officially rejoin any part of the EU , but he can get much of the way there by stealth. Brussels won’t just give him the “better deal”  he claims he could secure — not without him sacrificing some key aspect of our hard-won independence. Which? Starmer has let that slip.  He would follow Brussels diktat. Later, having done so long enough, he could perhaps argue we might as well be back in. Labour was every bit as sneaky and undemocratic under Blair  and Brown — and again when Starmer himself tried to reverse the 2016 referendum verdict.                      The Remainer-in-chief would not “make Brexit work”. He wouldn’t even keep it safe.                                         Get tax down                                         WE are baffled why Jeremy Hunt would ignite Tory infighting by glibly crushing hopes of a tax cut in a radio interview.                    We accept we needed a steadier Chancellor  after the Liz Truss  debacle. And inflation  and our massive debt payments are still worrying. But no Tory  Government should readily maintain the highest tax burden in 70 years as it kills growth and hurts families. It should be bold, slash public spending , free up money to ease households’ pain and attract job-creating investment. Labour would do none.                      So Mr Hunt can still remind the public of one key reason to vote Tory: Lower taxes.                                         Doesn’t add up                                         A-LEVELS are ripe for reinvention. But we cannot see the merit in making kids study maths to 18, as Rishi Sunak wants.                    Yes, employers would love school-leavers witha wider range of skills a new “British baccalaureate”  might provide. But most jobs never require maths  beyond the level of, say, a 14-year-old. Plus, we don’t have enough maths teachers. And Mr Sunak  wouldn’t act until after the next election  anyway.                      It may, then, all be academic.                                         Secret justice                                         OUR courts must never hold rape trials in secret, as the Law Commission proposes.                    It claims excluding the public and almost all Press would ease victims’ stress. But they are already anonymous for life and can testify via video link. Open justice is sacred. Abandon it for certain cases and they will go unreported . . . so a rapist’s further victims would never know to come forward.                      It is sinister — and must be rejected.                    Load-Date: September 22, 2023  End of Document
