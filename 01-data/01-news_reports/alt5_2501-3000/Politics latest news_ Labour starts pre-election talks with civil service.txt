   Politics latest news: Labour starts pre-election talks with civil service telegraph.co.uk February 2, 2024 Friday 4:00 PM GMT  Copyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: POLITICS; Version:1 Length: 3554 words Byline: By Jack Maidment, Politics Live Blog Editor Body   Labour has started formal access talks with the civil service in preparation for a potential change of government at the next general election. Sir Keir Starmer wrote to Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to request to start the preparations last month after Rishi Sunak authorised that the talks could begin. The meetings are an opportunity for Labour to discuss its agenda for government and establish relationships with senior officials in Whitehall. A Labour spokesman said: “Access talks have commenced. Shadow cabinet teams will begin to meet with departments.” Mr Sunak has said it is his “working assumption” that the next election will take place in the second half of this year. Access talks are held in the run-up to every general election in the UK and are designed to ensure there is a smooth transfer of power should the opposition win.

The latest update to the tracker puts Labour on 45 per cent and the Tories on 25 per cent.  Labour first took the lead over the Tories back in November 2021.                       02 Feb 2024-02:46PM GMT                                         Labour starts pre-election access talks with civil service                     Labour has started access talks with the civil service in preparation for a potential change of government after the general election. Sir Keir Starmer wrote to Cabinet Secretary Simon Case to request to start the preparations last month after Rishi Sunak authorised that the talks could begin. The meetings are an opportunity for Labour to discuss its agenda for government and establish relationships with senior officials in Whitehall. A Labour spokesman said: “Access talks have commenced. Shadow cabinet teams will begin to meet with departments.” Mr Sunak has said it is his “working assumption” that the next election will take place in the second half of this year.                       02 Feb 2024-02:44PM GMT                                         Home Office asks for extra £2.6bn                    The Home Office has asked for parliamentary approval for an emergency £2.6 billion in cash after spending more than expected on asylum accommodation. James Cleverly made the request for a “contingencies fund advance” via a written statement, which the Home Office said will enable the department “to deliver services with unpredictable final costs, such as the asylum system”. The Home Office spent around £8 million a day last year for migrants to be put up in hotels, with official figures last summer showing more than 50,000 were housed in hotel rooms.                      02 Feb 2024-02:27PM GMT                                         Lord Frost says Tories must be ‘prepared to defend’ Brexit                     Lord Frost said the Conservative Party must be “prepared to defend” Brexit because if voters believe Britain’s split from the EU is failing then the Tories will “inevitably fail too”.  The former Brexit minister wrote in a piece for The Telegraph:  “We left the EU four years ago this week. Sadly, with a couple of exceptions, no current minister acknowledged the fact. Yet the Conservative Party owns Brexit.  “Whether ministers like it or not, or maybe even wish it hadn’t happened, it’s the central policy of the Party and the government. They must be prepared to defend and explain it – to show why it’s so important that Britain is a proper democracy once again.  “For if voters come to believe Brexit is failing, then the Conservative Party will inevitably fail too.” You can read the piece in full here.                        02 Feb 2024-02:07PM GMT                                         Pictured: Sir Jeffrey Donaldson arrives at Stormont ahead of return of power-sharing on Saturday                                         02 Feb 2024-01:49PM GMT                                         Sunak and Meloni hold call on illegal migration                     Rishi Sunak and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni agreed to “continue working closely together” to tackle illegal migration in Europe during a phone call this morning, No 10 said.  A Downing Street spokesman said: “They discussed ongoing UK-Italy collaboration to tackle criminal people smuggling gangs and deal with illegal migration. “The Prime Minister noted the passage of the Italy-Albania agreement, and leaders agreed to continue working closely together to develop innovative partnerships across Europe and with countries along the migration route. “The Prime Minister welcomed the agreement of a new European Union funding package for Ukraine, following the UK’s commitment of £2.5 billion in military assistance last month, stressing the importance of maintaining international support for Ukraine’s defence against Russian aggression. “They also discussed wider UK-Italy defence and security cooperation, including the successful Global Combat Air Programme to develop next-generation fighter jets.”                      02 Feb 2024-01:10PM GMT                                         Eight in 10 believe Sunak represents ‘more of the same’                     The overwhelming majority of voters believe Rishi Sunak represents “more of the same” rather than change, according to a new poll.  A survey conducted in January by the More in Common group found that 80 per cent of respondents said Mr Sunak represents “more of the same”.  Just one fifth said he represents change.  The numbers were not too dissimilar for Sir Keir Starmer: 59 per cent said more of the same and 41 per cent said change.  Luke Tryl, the UK director of More in Common, tweeted:  That said it’s not great news for the opposition leader-almost 60% of Brits say that Keir Starmer also represents more of the same-including almost 3 in 10 who are currently intending to vote Labour, and nearly 70% of those who Don’t Know. pic.twitter.com/wvKTSDNJVu                      02 Feb 2024-12:54PM GMT                                         No 10 denies returns agreement with Turkey has fallen through                     Downing Street denied that a planned migrant returns agreement with Turkey had fallen through (see the post below at 11.34).  Asked the question, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “No. We do and can return people to Turkey, there has been no changes to the arrangements we have between the UK and Turkey.” Asked if Turkey is a safe country, the spokesman said: “Yes. Turkey is an EU accession state, it is a Nato ally. We can and do return people to Turkey.”                       02 Feb 2024-12:27PM GMT                                         Join the conversation                    Many Telegraph readers in today’s live blog comments section are pleased, but not surprised, at the news that Reform UK has hit its highest-ever level of support in Red Wall seats.                      Salty W said: “The Tories knew that the Red Wall seats were only on loan and theirs as long as they delivered Brexit and controlled immigration, they failed. So to nobody’s surprise whatsoever, those seats will now go back to Labour with Reform splitting the Tory vote.”                      John C said: “Reform could not be a better name for a party because it’s a reform we so badly need. Personally, and bearing in mind I am quite conservative in my actions, we need a political revolution where money becomes secondary for a while as we regain our culture and set of values. Immigration and the chaos it has caused need far more than just stopping, it needs reversing to an ‘either with us or against us’ approach.”                      O.C said: “Reform of the country is on its way, like it or not. Where I live the SNP and Labour are running neck and neck, and the Conservatives are running scared of the Reform Party. Or at least my Tory MP is. Even if Reform gains no seats, it will gain millions of votes in the rest of the country. In my experience, people vote for what they want, and it looks like millions want neither Labour nor Tory. They want the Reform Party.”                      02 Feb 2024-12:04PM GMT                                         Government announces £35m restoration plan for Tyne Bridge                     The famous Tyne Bridge will benefit from a £35million restoration announced by the Government this morning.  The roads minister, Guy Opperman, confirmed the move this morning, with the money to be spent on an extensive renovation programme.  Mr Opperman said: “Today is a historic day for Newcastle and the North East. Our £35 million boost will restore the Tyne Bridge in all its glory so that it can shine proudly as one of the UK’s most iconic landmarks. “This is part of the Government’s Network North plan which will improve local transport across the North East, with today’s announcement following our record £544 million in funding for a long-term plan to resurface local roads across the North East.”                       02 Feb 2024-11:34AM GMT                                         Braverman urges Government to look again at Turkey migrant return deal                     Suella Braverman has urged the Government to look again at a planned migrant returns agreement with Turkey following reports it is unlikely to go ahead.  The Times said that ministers’ hopes of striking a returns deal with Ankara, along the same lines as the UK’s current agreement with Albania, have collapsed after an internal Home Office review said Turkey was “a state that does not meet the criteria of being ‘generally safe’”. Ms Braverman, the former home secretary, tweeted: “This decision by the Home Office is very concerning.  “As Home Secretary I worked up proposals to list Turkey as a safe country: a member of the Council of Europe, a NATO ally and a Candidate country for EU accession. The government should re-think this decision.” The proportion of Turkish nationals arriving in the UK on small boats jumped from two per cent in 2022 to more than 10 per cent last year.                      02 Feb 2024-11:15AM GMT                                         Corporation tax changes ‘really annoying’ for businesses, says shadow minister                    A Labour promise not to increase corporation tax will give businesses the stability they need to make long term investment decisions relating to the UK, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury said this morning.  Darren Jones said that frequent changes to corporation tax in recent years had been “annoying” for firms and Rachel Reeves’ promise to cap the levy at the current rate of 25 per cent during a first term in power would provide certainty.  He told Sky News: “The announcement yesterday on corporation tax was important because business has told us… that the Conservatives and the number of chancellors and prime ministers they have had, they have been moving the corporation tax rates around, maybe five or six times since 2019.  “For businesses, especially global investors, that is really annoying because when you are trying to sign off investment decisions in particular projects… you look at the rate of return and how long it takes to pay back that initial investment.  “You have to factor in the amount of tax that you are expected to pay when you are doing that modelling and so if the tax rate moves around all of the time businesses can’t invest in the UK because it is too uncertain.”                       02 Feb 2024-10:56AM GMT                                         Exact green investment figure will ‘move around’, says Labour frontbencher                    Darren Jones, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the amount of money invested in green infrastructure under a Labour government will “move around” amid growing scrutiny of the party’s pledge to spend £28billion a year (see the post below at 09.17).  Mr Jones told Sky News: “The green prosperity plan is about future investment, it is not about day to day spending on public services. Anybody that runs a business will know future investment will depend on the success of your business and the market conditions at that time.  “For us that means that the number that we will get to if we are in government will be subject to two things. First it will be subject to the state of the economy, we know we are going to inherit a bad economy from the Conservatives but we have plans to turn that around… but it will also be subject to case by case business cases that if I am the chief secretariat to the Treasury in the next Labour government I will have to sign off.” He added: “The number will move around just as a matter of fact. It will depend on the strength of the economy, we will only invest when it is affordable to do so but also on a case by case basis working with the private sector.”                      02 Feb 2024-10:36AM GMT                                         No MP ‘totally carefree’ when it comes to safety concerns, says minister                     No MP is “totally carefree” when it comes to concerns about their safety, the minister for children David Johnston said this morning.  Mr Johnston was asked during an interview on Sky News if he felt safe doing his job as an MP.  He replied: “I generally feel safe. But there is always a lingering part I think in any MPs’ mind, knowing what has happened in recent years and knowing that a number of your colleagues get really quite regular death threats, particularly women, particularly women from ethnic minorities in parliament, that nobody I think doing this job is totally carefree and doesn’t in some way think about their safety and what they do and how.”                      02 Feb 2024-10:08AM GMT                                         Threats against MPs ‘completely unacceptable’, says minister                    A minister said threats being made against MPs were “completely unacceptable”.  David Johnston, the minister for children, said it was a “very bad situation” for an MP to feel unsafe doing the job as he responded to justice minister Mike Freer announcing that he will step down  at the next election over threats to his safety. Mr Johnston told Sky News: “I think across all political parties we were very sad to see that Mike has made that decision. We understand why his family are so concerned and why he has done so.  “But it is a very bad situation for somebody to feel that they are not safe representing the public in a role like this.  “Unfortunately we have seen two members of parliament murdered in recent years. The Speaker of the House of Commons has been working very closely with the police to see what more can be done for security.  “But yes, far too many of my colleagues do experience death threats and other threats of violence which are completely unacceptable.”                       02 Feb 2024-09:46AM GMT                                         Tories: Labour ‘all over the place’ on £28bn green pledge                     The Tories claimed Labour was “all over the place” over its £28billion green investment pledge following reports that the number is going to be dropped (see the post below at 09.17).  Laura Trott, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: “Labour are all over the place on their £28billion spending spree. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are divided about whether even to mention the cost of their own ‘2030’ promise.  “And now after a day of chaos in front of business leaders, Labour are creating more uncertainty by giving another desperate briefing saying they will drop the borrowing but keep the spending.  “They can’t say how they will pay for this promise because they don’t have a plan-and that will just mean higher taxes for working people.”                      02 Feb 2024-09:17AM GMT                                         Starmer ‘will ditch £28bn green investment pledge’                     Sir Keir Starmer is going to ditch Labour’s flagship plan to invest £28billion a year on green jobs and technology, it has been claimed.  Party sources told The Guardian that the figure would be dropped but the broader commitment to boosting green infrastructure would be retained.  A shadow minister told the newspaper: “The £28billion is definitely going as a figure. It will be changed to specific outcomes linked to specific investment, rather than being a random figure to be allocated at a later date.” The £28billion pledge has been repeatedly watered down. It started as a pledge to invest the sum every year from the first year of being in power. That was then changed to an ambition to hit the number in the second half of a first term.  But Labour has wobbled even more on the figure in recent weeks, with numerous senior figures failing to commit to it.                      02 Feb 2024-08:54AM GMT                                         Ed Balls warns Rachel Reeves is ‘boxing herself in’ on tax                    Ed Balls, the former shadow chancellor, has warned Rachel Reeves that she is “boxing herself in” by ruling out certain tax rises.  Mr Balls said the current shadow chancellor was “absolutely removing room for manoeuvre” and that could prove problematic if Labour’s “fiscal inheritance turns out to be tougher” than expected.  His comments, made on his Political Currency podcast, came after Ms Reeves used a Labour business conference yesterday to promise there would be no rise in corporation tax during the first term of a Labour government.  Mr Balls said: “I think the thing which worries me is the extent to which Rachel is choosing on tax to box herself in quite a lot.  Ed Balls says Rachel Reeves' plan to cap corporation tax and rule out a cap on bankers’ bonuses will "box Labour in".Do you agree? Listen to Political Currency: https://t.co/9qA6ffpP8h pic.twitter.com/ndC78o0oTi “She doesn’t want to raise taxes on working people, she doesn’t want to raise wealth taxes, she’s now not going to have a bank bonus cap and she has also announced at the Labour business conference there’ll be no rise in corporation tax either in the first parliament.  “And when you think, you know: No rise on taxes on working people, no wealth taxes, no [cap] on bankers’ bonuses, no rise in corporation tax.  “If the fiscal inheritance turns out to be tougher, if the pressures on public services are as people expect, this is going to be a very, very difficult task for her and she’s absolutely removing room for manoeuvre.”                       02 Feb 2024-08:31AM GMT                                         Tories losing one fifth of 2019 Red Wall supporters to Reform UK                    One fifth of 2019 Tory voters in Red Wall seats now say they would vote for Reform UK, according to a new poll.  Some 20 per cent of people who backed the Conservatives in the key seats said they would now support Reform if a general election were to be held tomorrow.  That is the highest percentage of 2019 Tory backers to switch to Reform that Redfield & Wilton Strategies has recorded since it started its Red Wall tracker poll back in March 2022. The latest survey, conducted between Jan 30-31, found that 50 per cent of 2019 Red Wall Tory supporters still intend to vote Tory-but 20 per cent said Reform and 15 per cent said Labour.

A Redfield & Wilton Strategies survey, conducted between Jan 30-31, put Richard Tice’s party on 14 per cent of the vote. That was up by three points when compared to the company’s previous poll conducted between Dec 17-18.

Reform is in third place in the Red Wall, with Labour leading the Tories by 20 points overall, 48 per cent to 28 per cent. The Red Wall refers to 40 mostly northern, traditionally Labour voting constituencies. The Conservatives won all but one of them at the 2019 general election, then securing Hartlepool at a later by-election.  Load-Date: February 2, 2024  End of Document
