In Monday night's episode of the ITV reality show, viewers saw First Dates star Fred Sirieix hit out ex politician Nigel Farage, who he slammed as 'shameful' over his Brexit campaign.

Sparking the debate, Fred asked the former MEP: "What's the beneift of Brexit", to which he replied: "To know that we're independent, we stand on our own two feet in the world." Fred hit back telling him Brexit was "about immigration". He told him: "I remember your poster, I thought it was shameful." He accused Nigel of "demonising migrants" with the controversial 'breaking point' campaign poster, which featured an image of a large queue of migrants.  Fred also hit out at the ex politician over price rises, telling him: "You have cost the country, you're responsible for that". Nigel hit back at the comments, telling Fred: "Brexit is about one thing and one thing only -being self governing. We can get it right or make an absolute mess of it but we are in charge. And the people that make those decisions, we can hire or fire them at the next election."  Fred admitted they would have to "agree to disagree" but made one final dig at Nigel, telling him: "We have all lost out." In the Bush Telegraph, Nigel admitted he knew it "wouldn't be long" before one of his campmates brought up the issue.  Not all of the campmates wanted to take part in the debate. Food critic Grace Dent and Hollyoaks actor Nick Pickard made a dash for it when tensions started to rise. "Fred's not going to change his mind on anything," Grace told Nick as they made their way to the creek to do some washing up.  Later on, Fred told Grace: "I don't thinks it's a case of getting it out of my system... it's having a conversation. What's important to me is integrity and speaking the truth." He also told the Bush Telegraph: "Nigel Farage is in the jungle with me so we're bound to have this conversation but at the end of the day nothing is going to change."  Nigel was also quizzed about former prime minister Boris Johnson. This Morning presenter Josie Gibson asked what Mr Johnson was personally like, to which Nigel said: "Entertaining in small doses. He's surprisingly introverted. You see this big act, fluffing the hair... surprising." Questioned on if the former prime minister was "a fumbler in real life", he added: "I think he's one of the most disorganised human beings that possibly ever lived. The whole thing's bloody chaos. Shambles." Load-Date: November 20, 2023  End of Document
