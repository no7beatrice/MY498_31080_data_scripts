   Nigel Farage quote 'Brexit has failed' appears on Wiltshire billboard Swindon Advertiser June 5, 2023 Monday  Copyright 2023 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Length: 233 words Byline: Annette J Beveridge Body   A POLITICAL billboard by guerilla protestors 'Led by Donkeys' has appeared close to Salisbury Railway station. The billboard at the top of Fisherton Street depicts former UKIP leader and now, GB News presenter Nigel Farage stating 'Brexit has failed'. On May 31, Led by Donkeys successfully raised 81,824 with 3823 supporters in just 14 days and 150 of these posters have been distributed around towns and cities across Britain. On the Crowdfunding page, the campaign group state: "Nigel Farage has finally admitted Brexit has failed. It's a colossal admission from the godfather of the Brexit campaign and should be the final verdict on the catastrophic experiment." The group state that every penny of the crowdfunded goes into booking more sites. Led by Donkeys was set up by four friends who wanted to highlight the hypocrisy of politicians on Brexit and the group uses crowdfunding to raise funds. This is not the first time the group have put up a billboard in Salisbury. Previously, a poster was erected in West Street, which depicted a tweet from Nigel Farage stating: "In a 52-48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way." This was dated May 16, 2016. The four founders of the anti-Brexit group continue to criticise actions by the Conservative government and have used satire to target those politicians who were pro-Brexit. Salisbury MP John Glen has been approached for a comment. Load-Date: June 5, 2023  End of Document
