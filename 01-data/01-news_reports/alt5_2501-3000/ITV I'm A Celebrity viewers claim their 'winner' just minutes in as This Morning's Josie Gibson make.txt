Get Me Out Of Here is finally here and fans have already had their say on who they want as their 'winner'. Kicking off on Sunday night Nov 19, the much loved ITV reality show returned with a brand new host of famous faces. Amongst this year's lineup is actress Jamie Lynn Spears, TV personality Sam Thompson, ex politician Nigel Farage and JLS star Marvin Humes. Sunday night's launch episode will see each of the stars arrive Down Under as they're forced to take on challenges overseen by hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly, before entering the camp.  The programme began with an entrance like no other, which saw This Morning presenter Josie Gibson, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage and YouTuber Nella Rose dropped right into the middle of the scorching Australian Outback with no idea what they were facing.  Before Nella arrived, Josie and Nigel met with the ITV host telling him: "I did not think I'd be seeing you here Mr Farage'. Josie then admitted: "I thought this was a good idea until they dropped us off in the middle of nowhere. I've never been so petrified." Nigel then replied: "It's something different in life, it's an adventure. It's a challenge, it's not going to be easy, but why not". But Josie then quipped: "It can't be worse than Brexit," in a cheeky dig to the politician.  Nigel then laughed: "Oh... didn't take long did it Didn't take long. I had a feeling we'd get a bit of that!," laughing too Josie said: "Only joking." The pair were then met by Nella before they noticed there was a button to call for assistance, which dialled through to hosts Ant and Dec. Dec said: "Welcome to the Australian Outback. For now, it's just the three of you. Your fellow celebrities are 2,000 miles away on the Gold Coast," as Ant then explained: "The other celebrities will be trying to win stars for the first meal in camp. However, how much time they have to do that will be down to you three. You'll now take on challenges to win tokens, the more tokens you win, the more time they'll have." Getting into a jeep to make their way to their first challenge, Nigel opted to drive, before asking: "Where's the handbrake" Nella and Josie screamed as he sped away through the dusty Outback. But as soon as the scene aired, viewers quickly took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to commend Josie for her Brexit comment. @onlyjoekin_ wrote: "It can't be worse than Brexit" Josie's already my winner #imaceleb." @SophieShipton_ said: "Can't be worse than Brexit, Josie you are a legend!!," as @fwaqa wrote: "I love Josie #ImACeleb." @x3ChelseaLouise wrote: "Josie Gibson is my winner already x #ImACeleb," as @BeckyMorrish13 agreed: "Ok Josie is already my winner #ImACeleb." @Alison_King_Fan typed: "not josie already making a brexit dig my winner #imaceleb," as @Derekosullivan_ said: "Hasn't even started yet and I just know Josie is gonna be an iconic camp mate." @thecaseybyrne also laughed at one of Josie's earlier comments: "I love snakes I've fallen enough with enough of them" I love Josie, what a wonderful human #ImACeleb #ImACelebrity."
