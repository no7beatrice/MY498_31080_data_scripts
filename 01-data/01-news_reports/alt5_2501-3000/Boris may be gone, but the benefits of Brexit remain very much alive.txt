   Boris may be gone, but the benefits of Brexit remain very much alive The Sunday Telegraph (London) June 18, 2023 Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: SUNDAY;NEWS; Pg. 7 Length: 237 words Body   One can become sentimental about the elderly, which is perhaps why it warms even my heart to see Michael Heseltine, in his 91st year, fulminating on television about Boris Johnson's humiliation. He feels that it proves Brexit must be reversed: after all (Heseltinian logic goes), since Johnson appears to have lied about everything else, then surely the scoundrel lied about Brexit? And thus didn't 17.4million of us vote for a lie? No, we didn't: Johnson was not Brexit. Indeed, I suspect I am one of millions of lifelong Brexiteers who voted Leave despite Johnson's clambering on the bandwagon, not because of it. Brexit and he must be separated. Seven years ago, almost to the day, I wrote in these pages that the main reason to vote Leave the following Thursday was to improve democracy - to ensure that no measures were imposed upon us without our having approved them at a general election. The European Union pretends to be a democracy, but in fact thrives on its absence. Partly because of the Covid pandemic and partly because of sheer incompetence, the Government has so far failed to capitalise on Brexit. Between now and a generalelection campaign, the Government must use its democratic freedom to deregulate, to forge trade deals and (above all) to control immigration. Such policies only resemble lies if promised but not carried out. Johnson may be politically dead, but the benefits of Brexit are very much alive.
