   Picardo pledges to reach a "historic" post-Brexit deal for Gibraltar if re-elected CE Noticias Financieras English October 13, 2023 Friday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC. All Rights Reserved Copyright 2023 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved Length: 644 words Body          Fabian Picardo pledged yesterday to reach "very soon" a "historic" agreement for Gibraltar in its future relations with the EU if he is re-elected in the elections held yesterday in the Rock - in limbo since Brexit - whose results will be known this Friday. "There are still bangs to negotiate. It would not be good to change the negotiating team because that can lead to what is almost agreed, not being agreed," warned the socialist leader when casting his vote. The Brexit forces Madrid and the Rock to find a pragmatic solution of coexistence. Around 30,000 people cross the fence every day. Among them, 15,000 workers, of which 10,000 are Spaniards from an area such as the Campo de Gibraltar, where unemployment rarely drops below 30%. Picardo insists that, being from the beginning, knows all the ins and outs of talks that seek to end the controls on the fence. However, beyond the negotiations to solve the consequences of a divorce that the Yankees did not want, the pandemic, the problems in primary health care and the delays in the construction of official promotion have been wearing down the socialist leader. The last polls were extremely close. Therefore, it is not ruled out that, after more than twelve years in power, Picardo will lose to the GSD conservatives led by Keith Azopardi. Picardo said yesterday that he had the "moral obligation" to run in these elections because, due to covid, his government has assumed a "large" debt that "was not in the election program". "I was not going to leave with my tail between my legs, escaping from having incurred such a debt, because I know I did it right, with the agreement of the leader of the opposition, although he is already shying away from that agreement," he added. For his part, Azopardi assured that he is ready, if he wins, to take on "the challenge" of being the next chief minister of the colony because he has "experience", since he was minister and vice-president in the governments of Peter Caruana.  The Conservative leader stressed that his party and Picardo's party do not have "many differences" in their positions on fundamental issues such as "sovereignty, jurisdiction or control". "We have not been in that negotiating room" but "we are going to start the negotiations on the basis of where the negotiations have come from. We are not going to start again. We are going to continue where we left off. If it is true that it was within 0.1% of reaching an agreement, we will start from there," he said. On New Year's Eve 2020, a few hours before the end of the Brexit transition period, London and Madrid managed to close `in extremis' an agreement in principle to avoid the strict controls at the border. The text contained the guidelines to close a treaty between the European Commission and the United Kingdom on the Rock. But it is only a temporary solution that can be rescinded at any time and that could have a different course depending on whether the PP or PSOE finally governs in Spain. If you want flexibility in the fence, the Schengen border must be outsourced to the port and airport of the Rock. But that requires the presence of agents from Spain (Schengen member). And therein lies the crux of the matter. Especially considering that the land where the airport is built was not contemplated in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713-1715). The British took it over in the 19th century, when epidemics forced the population to move to the isthmus. In Brussels, there is interest in getting them to move forward. In any case, there is a desire to give its place to Spain which, as a member of the bloc, after Brexit managed to get the EU to guarantee it veto power for any pact reached regarding the Rock. Likewise, Madrid got the EU to mention, for the first time, Gibraltar as a colony, thus joining the criteria that the UN has maintained on the territory since 1967.
