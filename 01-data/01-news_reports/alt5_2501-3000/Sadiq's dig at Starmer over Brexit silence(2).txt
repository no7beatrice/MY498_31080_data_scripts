   Sadiq's dig at Starmer over Brexit silence Mail on Sunday (London) July 31, 2023 Monday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 18 Length: 219 words Byline: Andrew Pierce Body   LABOUR'S civil war has intensified now that London's mayor Sadiq Khan has vowed to go ahead with the expansion of the Ultra-Low Emission Zone (Ulez) after winning a High Court challenge against it. Sir Keir Starmer is pushing to delay the expansion of the daily £12.50 tax on older cars, but Khan so far is refusing to back down. I hear there are other tensions between the mayor and the Labour leader, too - this time over Brexit. In a thinly veiled swipe at his boss, Khan has criticised the UK's policy towards Europe in The New York Times - a newspaper which loves to attack Britain. In an article headlined 'In the UK a disaster no one wants to talk about', Khan is quoted as saying: 'I'm frustrated that no one's talking about it.' Describing Brexit as 'the elephant in the room', he told the newspaper theUK should forge closer trade and immigration ties with the EU.Starmer's Brexit policy is focused upon leaving behind 'arguments of the past'. Though he did, of course, demand a second referendum in the last Parliament, he's now desperate to avoid all discussion of Brexit for fear of alienating voters in the so-called Red Wall seats that turned blue at the 2019 election. For a supposed governmentin-waiting, having their two most senior elected politicians in yet another dispute hardly inspires confidence. Load-Date: October 27, 2023  End of Document
