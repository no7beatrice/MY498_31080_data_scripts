Cameron, who resigned from the Government in 2016, following the referendum on the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU), is known for his pro-European stances and criticized by many for having called for a plebiscite. His appointment could reopen Brexit divisions again.  â(EURO)oeAlthough I have been away from the front line of politics for the last seven years, I hope that my experience, will help me to help the prime minister meet these vital challenges.â David Cameron  The former British leader said that, despite having been out of frontline politics for years, he hopes that his previous experience as leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister will be useful. "Although I have been out of frontline politics for the last seven years, I hope my experience will help me to help the prime minister meet these vital challenges," he said after the appointment.  The former premier added that while he may not have agreed with some "individual decisions" taken by Sunak, the prime minister is a "strong and capable" leader.  He also said the UK faces a "daunting set of international challenges," referring to conflicts such as those in Ukraine and the Middle East.  Unlike his predecessor, Cameron is not an MP and will not appear before the House of Commons, but will be appointed by Sunak as a member of the House of Lords, which is not elected in the UK.  For this the prime minister offered him a life peerage, which means he can sit in the upper house for life.  This allows her to hold office and avoid having to regularly face questions and questioning from MPs. Braverman's departureSunak fired Braverman amid several internal controversies, a decision that marks a turning point in the recent cabinet reshuffle ahead of elections in 2024.  Known for her firm and often controversial positions, especially within the more right-wing conservative faction, the flamboyant former Interior Minister had created tensions with the government, where there were concerns that her interventions in the media could affect re-election plans.  The straw that broke the camel's back was an article in a British newspaper, criticizing the Metropolitan Police (Met) over the organization of pro-Palestinian protests in central London.  In a statement after her dismissal, she said that "it was the greatest privilege of her life to serve as Home Secretary. I will have more to say in due course."  She also faced criticism for trivializing the refugee situation and for prioritizing immigration control over other issues.  In addition, Braverman, who is the daughter of immigrants from Kenya and Mauritius, made controversial statements questioning the integration of immigrants and suggesting that they live "parallel lives".  On social media, she criticized the distribution of tents to homeless people and sought to impose fines on the charities involved.   Her statements were condemned by former police officers and politicians, accusing her of fomenting division.  Sunak's reorganization also coincides with the pending Supreme Court decision on the plan to send refugees to Rwanda.  In that sense, a favorable ruling could reinforce the Government's narrative of having an effective plan to handle immigration, while a ruling against could intensify calls for the UK to leave the European Convention on Human Rights, with Braverman possibly leading this position from outside the Government. Cabinet reshuffle and its repercussionsWith a general election due next year, the composition of the Cabinet is crucial to the future of the Conservative Party and the country.   This reshuffle, surprising in many quarters, raises questions about the direction of the Sunak government and the ability of his team to meet the current political and social challenges.  In turn, Cameronâ¤?s return and Bravermanâ¤?s departure generated mixed reactions among Conservative Party members.  Some expressed support for Cameron, recognizing his experience and political skills, but others questioned the appropriateness of his return, especially because of the controversies he left in his time at 10 Downing Street, with a record that includes his austerity policies, his decisions regarding Brexit, his interest in strengthening relations with China, and allegations of undue influence during his involvement in the collapsed specialist finance group Greensill.  Jacob Rees-Mogg, a former trade minister and current presenter on GB News, criticized Sunak's decision to remove Braverman, stating that "Suella understood what the British voter was thinking and was trying to do something about it."  While Rees-Mogg acknowledged that Cameron "got it wrong on the Brexit issue, he stressed that he gave Britons the choice to vote."  However, he described him as "a very intelligent and capable person".  Labour says the renewal of the government team shows that Sunak's aim to deliver change is "laughable".  So far, the only Labour member to comment on the ministerial reshuffle is Pat McFadden, the party's national campaign coordinator, The Guardian noted.  "A few weeks ago, Rishi Sunak said David Cameron was part of a failed status quo and now he will bring him back as his life raft. This demolishes the prime ministerÃ¢â'¬â"¢s ridiculous claim to offer change after 13 years of failed Conservatism,Ã¢â'¬ he said.  Scottish Independence Party (SNP) deputy leader at Westminster, Mhairi Black , said Scotland will be âoehorrifiedâ and â(EURO)oeshows how tired this Conservative government is.â  â(EURO)oePeople in Scotland will be appalled that the architect of 13 years of Conservative austerity cuts and the disastrous Brexit referendum is back in government,â(EURO) she said.  Black told Scottish media that Cameron's damaging Conservative policies slashed Scotland's budget, battered the economy, pushed millions into poverty and cut vital public services.  "And his catastrophic error of judgment on Brexit is the UK's biggest foreign policy disaster since the Iraq war,â(EURO) he said.  The Cabinet reshuffle also included the replacement of other ministers such as Environment and Transport, among others, while Jeremy Hunt will remain as Finance Minister.  Meanwhile, according to a government spokesman, Cleverly, on taking up his new post as Home Secretary, stressed the importance of immigration on his agenda.  "I am absolutely committed to stopping the crossing of boats as we promised, but also to making sure that everyone in the UK feels safe and secure," he stressed.
