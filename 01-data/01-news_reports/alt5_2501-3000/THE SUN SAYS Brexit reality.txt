   THE SUN SAYS Brexit reality The Sun (England) June 23, 2023 Friday Edition 1, National Edition  Copyright 2023 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 12 Length: 232 words Body   SEVEN years ago today Leave won the epic battle for Brexit ... only for a band of extremist, quasi-religious Remainers to launch a campaign of lies aimed at turning back the clock. Their idea, even now, is to persuade the nation our historic decision "has failed", hoping ultimately to get us back into the EU. These cynical propagandists, without evidence, blame all our woes on Brexit. They even sneer that most Leavers regret their vote. It's drivel. A major new survey reveals that they regret only this: That politicians have not yet capitalised on the new freedoms they voted for. The vast majority would vote Leave again. And though Leavers might currently be outnumbered, we'll bet new young Remainers would recoil at the reality: The hideous division of another poll, taxes rising to fund EU membership, the Pound scrapped, our laws crafted in Brussels, our own trade deals binned. But we must say this too: It is ludicrous for anyone, on any side, to declare yet that Brexit is a success or a failure. We left the EU fully only in January 2021. Every moment since has been overshadowed by Covid, war and the horrific economic fallout from both. Blaming Brexit for our problems with those two giant calamities crushing our economy is dishonest, opportunist tosh. We are just two years into what was always a long-term project. Brexit may take a decade to bear truly significant fruit. But it will. Load-Date: June 23, 2023  End of Document
