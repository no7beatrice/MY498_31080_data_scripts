   Bank lawyer said Brexit 'tragic' The Daily Telegraph (London) July 29, 2023 Saturday Edition 1, Scotland  Copyright 2023 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Pg. 2 Length: 259 words Byline: Nick Gutteridge Body   A SENIOR consultant at the law firm hired by NatWest to investigate the closure of Nigel Farage's account has described Brexit as "a tragedy". Chris Hale penned an opinion piece in which he referred to the referendum debate as a "disturbing mix of xenophobia, racism and nostalgia". Mr Hale, who was described by the industry magazine that ran the article as a "pro-Remain lawyer", works for Travers Smith. The leading legal firm was appointed yesterday by NatWest to review Mr Farage's case and to look at how the bank handles the closure of accounts. Mr Farage said the latest revelations raised questions over whether the outcomes of the independent investigation can be taken seriously. They come after Howard Davies, the NatWest Group chairman, described the bank's former chief executive Dame Alison Rose as a "great leader". His comments, which come after Dame Alison was forced to resign over the institution's handling of the case, sparked consternation among MPs. Mr Farage tweeted yesterday: "Nat- West Group has chosen establishment legal firm Travers Smith to investigate my account closure. The Chair Emeritus and Senior Consultant, Chris Hale, is a 'pro-Remain Lawyer' who said Brexit was 'a tragedy'. "He wrote about 'xenophobia, racism and nostalgia' during the Brexit debate … these are the same words used against me in the secret Coutts dossier. How can anyone take seriously anything this review will say?" Mr Hale made the remarks on the day after the 2016 Brexit referendum result. Travers Smith and NatWest have both been approached for comment. Load-Date: October 26, 2023  End of Document
