   THE SUN SAYS Sir Keir Starmer’s plan to renegotiate a Brexit deal with the EU is utter fantasy thesun.co.uk September 18, 2023 Monday 11:33 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 NEWS GROUP NEWSPAPERS LTD All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS,OPINION,BREXIT,CONSERVATIVE PARTY,EUROPEAN UNION,LABOUR PARTY,SUN SAYS,THE SUN NEWSPAPER; Version:1 Length: 461 words Byline: The Sun Body                        A Keir danger                                         BE in no doubt. Brexit is in real danger.                    Sir Keir Starmer’s  plan to renegotiate a deal with the EU is, like his ideas to tackle illegal migration, utter fantasy. There is no appetite in Brussels  to give us a better deal.  Why would they? But what the EU WILL scent from the Labour leader’s promises is Brexiteer  blood. Instead, the price of their demands will be so high — dynamic alignment, for starters — that it will inevitably turn the UK into a rule-taker once more. We’d be left with what was once dubbed BRINO, or Brexit In Name Only. Soon enough the cry would go up that we might as well rejoin anyway: Single Market, Customs Union and all. A total betrayal of the Take Back Control message of 2016, certainly. But who would bet against staunch Remainer Starmer  agreeing to that? And in the process sending us all straight back to the dark days of endless negotiations and a paralysed Government.  Sir Keir’s willingness to show his hand comes in part because the Tories haven’t yet fully seized the opportunities offered by Brexit.                      Had they done so, would the Labour leader be so bold?                                         Attack of Blob                                         TWO more crashing examples yesterday of how our elite believe they are above politicians and the people.                    A BBC documentary reveals how in 2020 — at the height of the Covid  pandemic — officials went to the Queen  to raise concerns over Boris Johnson’s  “conduct.” This seems to have boiled down to — at a time of unprecedented national emergency — robustly insisting civil servants do their jobs! Yet rather than bow to the wishes of their recently elected-by-a-landslide masters, the bedwetters of Whitehall tried to tell tales to the Palace in the hope Her Majesty would take it up with Boris privately. Meanwhile Mark Carney – the worst Bank of England  governor in memory, until Andrew Bailey  stepped down to the plate – insists Brexiteer Tories turned Britain into “Argentina-on-Thames”. In his arrogance he ignored the fact the UK economy is now stronger than France or Germany.                      These people are not on your side.                                         Rogue Force                                         THE tide of sleaze and corruption engulfing the Met Police  threatens to overwhelm new chief Mark Rowley.                    Officers and staff facing complaints of violence or discrimination against women and girls now number 1,600. Any one of them could be another Wayne Couzens.   It will take many years for Rowley to root out his rogue cops.                      He must not be deflected in his Herculean task.                    Load-Date: September 18, 2023  End of Document
