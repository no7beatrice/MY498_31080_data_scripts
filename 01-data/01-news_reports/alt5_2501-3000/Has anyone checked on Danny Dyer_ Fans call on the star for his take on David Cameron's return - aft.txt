Fans call on the star for his take on David Cameron's return - after his iconic 'He's in Nice with his trotters up' interview MailOnline November 14, 2023 Tuesday 2:21 PM GMT  Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd. All Rights Reserved  Section: NEWS; Version:2 Length: 466 words Byline: Rory Tingle, Home Affairs Correspondent For Mailonline Body   Fans have called for Danny Dyer to give his take on David Cameron's return - five years on from his iconic 'he's in Nice with his trotters up' rant.  The original clip saw the EastEnders star appear on Good Evening Britain to deliver his unvarnished opinion on the former Tory leader after he stepped down as Prime Minister following the Brexit vote.  Appearing alongside Jeremy Corbyn, Pamela Anderson, Ed Balls and Tory MP James Cleverly, Dyer lashed Mr Cameron for calling the divisive referendum before 'scuttling off' on holiday.  News that Mr Cameron will return to politics as Foreign Secretary in Rishi Sunak's government prompted Twitter users to demand he gives his response today.  'Has anyone checked on Danny Dyer?' one tweeted.  Others echoed similar thoughts, a second writing: 'Now that David Cameron has magically reappeared it's time to enjoy this classic Danny Dyer moment.' A third said: 'I'd pay to hear Danny Dyer's opinion on David Cameron's appointment today.'

'Never tire of seeing Danny Dyer's take on Cameron, the vehemence of his last word is epic,' she wrote.  Lucy Hudson added: 'This clip always cheers me up. Not just Danny saying what he says but the looks on the faces of Jeremy Corbyn and Pam Anderson.' Most social media users hailed the actor a 'hero' for his takedown of the ex-PM when he made the comments in 2018.  The spokeswoman for then prime minister Theresa May was even quizzed about the matter. She replied: 'Much like columnists and others, people who appear on broadcast and newspapers are perfectly entitled to their opinion. 'We have always been clear that Brexit is a challenging process, but we have made good progress on it.'

He raged: 'Let's go back to this whole Brexit thing, when you're judging them because they don't know what Brexit is. 'Who knows about Brexit? No one has got a f***** clue. You watch Question Time, it's comedy. 'No one knows what it is. It's like this mad riddle that no one knows what it is. 'So what's happened to that t*** David Cameron who brought it on? Let's be fair. How comes he can scuttle off. He called all this on. 'Where is he? He's in Europe. He's in Nice with his trotters up.  'Where is the geezer? I think he should be held accountable for it.' Load-Date: November 14, 2023  End of Document
