   David Cameron's return to government divides UK Conservatives CE Noticias Financieras English November 14, 2023 Tuesday  Copyright 2023 Content Engine, LLC.

Once a government reshuffle has been consummated, the cameras are allowed access to show the public the faces of the new Council of Ministers. Nervous smiles among the new members of the Cabinet; gestures of impostured security from those who repeat and even improve in rank. At the center of the long oval table in the Cabinet Room, Downing Street, Rishi Sunak presided over the first meeting of his new Executive on Tuesday. "Our purpose is nothing less than to drive forward the long-term decisions that are going to change this country for the better. I know that this is a strong and united team that will be able to deliver that change for all citizens," he said euphorically as he introduced a compact group of politicians of his own choosing, not inherited from the morass he found a year ago when he became head of government. The paradox was evident. Opposite him sat, as the new Foreign Secretary, former Prime Minister David Cameron. To assert his autonomy and self-identity, Sunak had decided to rescue the politician who inaugurated the current decade - almost 13 years, in fact - of Tory power in the United Kingdom. To reinforce his promise of change, he was bringing back the quintessential symbol of the Conservative status quo and, in Europe, the face that drove the Brexit referendum. "It's a return to the past. To a world in which Brexit may have happened legally, but it remains outside the mental framework of those who govern us," he has written in the pages of the Daily Telegraph, the newspaper bastion of the party's hard wing, David Frost, guardian of Eurosceptic essences. "It is a world of social-liberalism, of low-growth economic policy and low ambition, and of kowtowing to the permanent class of people who run institutions like the BBC or the Metropolitan Police [Scotland Yard]. Just as it was during David Cameron's time and as it will be again now," Frost lamented. The renegade politician expressed in a very graphic way the internal tragedy that divides the Conservative Party today. It is difficult to re-embrace the populist monster that unleashed the Brexit, and fed by characters like Boris Johnson. The support achieved by the Conservatives in the so-called red wall, the area in the north of England where the traditional vote was Labour until the 2019 general election, was a disavowal of the centered, elitist, condescending and neoliberal conservatism practiced by Cameron himself and his number two, the finance minister, George Osborne. Party affiliates who gave their backing to the failed Liz Truss against Sunak, in the primaries held a year ago to succeed Johnson, are not particularly enthusiastic about recovering the figure of a former prime minister who unwillingly caused the Brexit -by pushing for the 2016 referendum- and was responsible for years of economic austerity after the 2008 financial crisis. And, above all, they do not understand the dismissal of the now former Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, who flattered the ears of many of them with her heavy-handed speech against irregular immigration, crime and the left-wing bias, according to her, of the British establishment, as she made clear in the rostrum she wrote against the Metropolitan Police, which she accused of favoritism with pro-Palestinian demonstrations. "Enough is enough. If it wasn't enough to have a party leader whom the grassroots rejected, the polls now tell us that the voters don't want him either. It is time for Rishi Sunak to resign," said Andrea Jenkyns MP, a former secretary of state for education under Johnson, in a letter of withdrawal of confidence sent to the Conservative parliamentary group leadership on Monday. Jenkyns accused the prime minister of purging the center-right from his Cabinet, and sacking "the only person [Braverman] with a pair of balls to tell the truth about the scandalous state of our streets and the double standards of the police." Cameron's diplomatic legacy More moderate Conservative Party MPs cling to the memory of the Cameron who managed to rebuild the Tories' unsympathetic image, forged during the long tenure of Labour's Tony Blair, and return them to power. They remember his extensive diplomatic contacts, his success in forging an almost impossible coalition with the Liberal Democrats during his first government or his absolute majority in his second term. They celebrate, in short, Sunak's decision to surround himself with temperate, adult politicians. But as Enoch Powell, that racist and xenophobic Conservative MP who set the streets of England on fire in the 1960s, and to whom many critics compare Braverman these days, said: "Every political career inevitably ends in failure". Cameron's ended in immense disrepute and with an embarrassing surrender. After opening the door to the labyrinth of Brexit, with a referendum that he did not know how to manage, the image of a Prime Minister who threw in the towel, passed the mess to others and left office with the frivolity and lightness with which he was seen to turn around and leave whistling after announcing his resignation will remain for history. It wasn't just the Brexit fiasco. His flirtations with the Chinese government, against Washington, and at the same time his flirtations with the Dalai Lama, to Beijing's irritation; his war adventure in Libya, later questioned by the British Parliament itself; or his contradictions in describing Gaza as a "human prison" and then declaring himself the most "pro-Israeli" prime minister in history, are for many of his critics the clear proof of a politician with a lot of posturing but little substance. "I am one of the seven MPs sanctioned by the Chinese government after denouncing the genocide in Xinjiang, where labor slavery was practiced. And now David Cameron, who until recently was paid by the Chinese government to do certain things on its behalf, has reappeared," denounced Conservative MP Ian Duncan Smith. Cameron wanted to launch a multi-million dollar investment fund to promote trade relations between Beijing and London, fed by the Chinese Executive, and gave up the idea as Downing Street cooled its relations with the Asian power. He is also dragging the scandal of Greensill, the bankrupt fund that Cameron advised and for which he tried to obtain financial aid from the British government during the pandemic. Sunak has played a last desperate card, in the face of a bleak electoral panorama for the Conservatives -the general elections must be held within a year at the latest-, but it is not at all clear that the surprise of Cameron's return will help him to convey to the electorate an image of change that will convince them to give the Tories an umpteenth chance.
